kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Very BIG, but very useful","My only beef with these mugs is that they're so big. I own the smaller Fiestaware mugs too, and I complained about those being too small, but seriously - I wish there were a middle ground. Though I'd take 'too big' over too small any day. You can have a big cuppa tea or coffee or soup with these things. An excellent multitasker, I've even used mine to store cups of broth in the freezer. These definitely need some sort of tight-fitting lid developed for them for better storage in the fridge or freezer"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 13,1.0,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"This product is far more limited with regard to use than first thought!  When I received mine, it had missing parts making it useless.  The construction is not as sturdy and solid as many others like it, but the biggest strike against it is the lack of versatility in cooking"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"George Foreman GRV660 8-in1 Toaster Oven/Broiler/Rotisserie, Black","We use our Toaster Oven on a daily basis.  We have used the Rotisserie, baked and toasted in it.  It's also great for warming up leftovers.  This oven keeps our kitchen cool since we don't have to depend on our oven right now.  It's also easy clean-up.  We love it and would highly recommend to others. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Hits the spot!,"The SpotBot works very well, albeit, not always on the first go. Depending on the severity of the stain, two or three cycles might be necessary."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,WORKS GREAT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT,"This jar sealer is a necessity if you have a Foodsaver!  Much cheaper than using those expensive canisters and it keeps your food fresh!  There's nothing better than opening a jar and hearing the whoosh of air going in!  Lets you know it's fresh!  For all of those reviewers who had problems with it sealing, I have a tip that should eliminate those sealing problems.  When you seal the jar put TWO mason lids on top, one on top of the other.  Then seal the jar.  The top lid should pop right off and the bottom lid will be vacuumed tight and secure! (If the top lid doesn't come off right away, just give it a few hours and it will come loose.)  Not sure why it works this way, but it does!  For those jars that you seal for longer than a week I would recommend checking the seal every once and a while.  I have had a jar lose it's vacuum a time a two. BUT a great majority of the time it remains sealed.  Highly recommend"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 10,1.0,Not right item,Knife holder designed for the Ronco Knife set only. It is a poor fit for my knives.
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,bakes too hot,Every loaf we've made with this machine has come out over baked.  It just seems to bake at too high a temp
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Appreciate Quality ,"If you appreciate quality silicone this is the set for you.  The last customer commented on the softness of the spatula - pure virgin silicone is soft.  They must be used to cheap product.  The soft tip is perfect for cake batter and icing, mixing your favorite dip, or stirring your soup on the stove.  The overall design is classic and the red matches my KitchenAid stand mixer.    The hollow handles on the tools fit perfectly into my hand.  There are holes on the end if you have a European design kitchen for easy storing.  There are more pieces in the set then one really needs (great value) and I just love the canister.  What more can I say - I did not return this product"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,great product with touch of german engineering quality,"I got a costco version of this product, DX-8600, which is only 1500 watts, but the features are identical.  The iron heated up in 30 seconds, the steam burst was powerful, and all the controls were quite self-explanatory.  The INOX soleplate is installed with precision, and the water inlet cover is quite durable.  I have another Black and Decker D2020, and in comparison the D2020's soleplate edges are crooked, and the water inlet cover is quite brittle, and the D2020's soleplate is smaller than the DX-8600's.  Consumer Reports rated the D2020 and D2030 much higher than any Rowenta, but I will stay with this DX-8600 for a while"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Not at all what I expected,"I purchased a set of sheets from Amazon and they were amazing (much lower thread count) so I thought I'd try a higher thread count and after some reviews, went with these sheets.  Right out of the box, they were rough; after washed they were rough and stiff."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Oxo Flour Sifter,"I've only had the opportunity to use it once, however it was obvious upon arrival that the sifter was high quality.  It does take a bit of time to actually sift with it, but no more than with a normal once.  The plastic caps were especially handy, as well"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Low/No Oil cooking,"I'm an avid cook. I've hadmany ""non-stick"" pans. The finish on these is by far the best. Nothing stick on the cooking surface OR the underside of these. I've been using them for months and they arwe still as new as the day I first opened the box. Additionally, because they have such a fabulous surface I haven't been using oil in my cooking and everything has been browning beautifully as though I had. A really great set of pans that are definitely worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Versatile Ramekins,"I received 2 sets of these (in white) for a wedding shower. I love them, as they are the perfect size. I use them for serving in and baking with (they are perfect for melting a few tablespoons of margarine in the microwave!). My only complaint is that they show markings on the bottom of the bowl where utensils were used. But still...one of my favorite pieces in kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Could not be better!,"This is an excellent set of cookware.  Rugged, sturdy, and well-built.  The only down side for me is the fact that they are not dishwasher friendly.  I will definitely buy more Simply Calphalon"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 18,1.0,"Yes, it's junk",I absolutely love probe thermometers and I've tried all of them.  All of them stink.  The fatal flaw is the probe and they all seem to have probes of about equal quality.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,"Smokin', stinkin', pretty little blender","Well, I just got my blender, real excited to use it, filled it up with the ingredients, flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking, badly, and then died.  I turned it off and tried to turn it on again, and all it did was make a grumbly noise.  So I am sending it back and sticking with my old Hamilton that I have had for 9 years.  Why did I quit using it in the first place.  $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie.  $79 for this Waring and it crashed and burned on me.  My advice is it looks nice, but it isn't worth the money, especially since it died right away on me.  Oh well..."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,great set!,"I've had my set for almost 10 years and they still look great. The only thing I have a problem with are the glasses. I only have 1 juice glass left. All the rest broke in the dishwasher or even when hand washed! I never bought the silverware, but I have seen it at Wal-Mart during the Christmas season. Oh and the tea kettle rusted. But everything else is suberb"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,The Single Most Important Piece of Cookware You Can Own!,"If we had to settle on only one item from the ""pots and pans"" category as ""the pan"" in our home and in our RV, it would be a 12-inch cast iron skillet with a lid. Specifically, we'd go for this model from Lodge Manufacturing with an assist handle opposite the straight handle."
kitchen & housewares,44 of 60,1.0,"Rival QC, is half baked","Got this Rival RO200 Roaster Oven from Finalcallauction.com , reason for my paying more and getting the Rival was cause it had a window. My unit the temperature wouldn't go higher than 326 deg F. I wanted to use it to bake outside in summer heat, gonna be half baked at this temperature. Need 400 F for what I want to do. Should have bought somewhere else, finalcallauction.com only gives refunds, can't fix or replace. This is the second Rival Digital thingy I've had to return due to poor quality. I'll come back later and let you know how finalcallauction.com treated this return"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Christmas Sanity-saver,"We've purchased 6 of these in the last year and LOVE them.  Had both the Christmas trees and countless window candles on them this Christmas, and it was pure bliss not running around plugging and unplugging each day.  As others have mentioned, we were up and running in 10 minutes.  Zero functional problems.  Also, we LOVED the Override ""On"" and ""On Auto.""  We could click the tree on early with the push of a button, and using On Auto, the timer would resume its program with the next programmed action (which meant we could turn it on early, and it would still turn itself off at the programmed time)."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,homemade popsicle/fudgesicle are the best,"I love this product.  I make my own sugar free fudgesicles and they are great.  Even my finicky neighbor thought they were terrific.  This product makes something that adults can really appreciate, and I am sure children would too.  I have no kids but grandnephew though fudgesicles tasted just like store bought or better.  Simple easy to make.  Fudgesicles, pudding mix, 3 c. mile, and three dollaps of either plain yogurt or sour cream, mix in blender and poor into mold.  Should fill up all ten.  Freeze for 4 hours and ta da...fudgesicles.  Enjo"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,25 years and counting,"It's hard to find something new to say about Le Creuset that all other reviewers haven't. So I'm going to focus on clean-up and sturdiness. One of my favorite uses for this pot is polenta. That's right: nasty, sticky, constant-stirring polenta that sticks to everything and hardens to near-stone status if not cleaned immediately. I make a batch about once a week and keep it in the fridge for quick meals or snacks. Once the Le Creuset pot has cooled, I put it in the sink with a little Dawn and warm water and let it soak, then use a plain old plastic scraper for the tough bits and sponge off the rest. And that's it."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Love them, but cracking is definitely an issue!","I have been using Foodsaver canisters for just over one year now, and I own quite a few, of varying sizes.  A good percentage of them have cracked over that period of time.  (I hand wash the bottoms, wipe out the lids as directed, no temperature extremes, no abuse.  They just crack in my pantry.)  Normally, experiencing this (repeatedly) would be enough for me to swear off a product and never mess with it again, but when they're working, they work really well, and I have to say that Tilia's customer service stands behind these canisters.  They have cheerfully replaced every single one that's mysteriously cracked. (I did not ask them to replace the one my husband dropped and destroyed!)  Because they've given me no hassles about replacing their canisters, I have little hesitation about continuing to purchase their products.  My recommendation is to keep a record somewhere of the date and place of purchase for your canisters; they'll want this information if you call for a replacement.  The warranty period is one year; when they send a replacement, it's guaranteed for a year too.  "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,1.0,Cheapest Blanket Ever,"It feels nice and soft, but this blanket started turning to fuzz from the day I started using it.  Leaves lint and fuzz EVERYWHERE... I donated mine to charity a few weeks ago and am still finding the same little fuzz around the house and on my clothes to this da"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great mechanics/size.  Plastic frame is flimsy,"With 6 kids to feed we love the size. 12 pieces of french toast, 6 good sized pancakes at a time. The heat is consistant giving evenly browned sandwiches etc. The idea of the tilt for the bacon grease to run off is a good idea, but it leaves the griddle unstable. We tied the legs together and scrape the grease off the old fashioned way.  Also, the handle broke when dropped from 2 inches. The frame leaves a lot to be desired. But it's easy to wash and we use it 3-4 times a week and even take it on vacation with us as pancakes, casadillas and grilled cheese are a staple."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 16,2.0,Not that great,"    I expected more from kitchen aid. They are ok but not as non stick or as heavy as I was expecting. The pans I tossed out were about 10 years old with little non stick surface left but were almost as non stick as this new set of Kitchen aid. My old set was probably twice as thick and heavy. Love my kitchen aid mixer. I dont think I would buy another set. I would recomend going to a store and seeing this item in person before you buy and, everybody is right. It comes in the mail in the Kitchen aid box for everybody to see."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Cuisinart percolator coffee pot,"I love this coffee pot.  So far, no problems after a month. It is quick and keeps it hot."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great little skillet!,"While I have always loved cooking with cast iron, the Pro-Logic pre-seasoned skillets are really a fine improvement upon an old standard in our family.  I have started cooking with only coconut oil and it settles into the pan really nice, no smoke, and allows for a nice searing effect on small chops or steaks.  Scrambled and fied eggs just slide off the pan, better than another kind of coating, which is now proved to be unhealthy!  I give the Pro-Logic a total thumbs up"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Amazing...,"I throughly recommend these bowls to anyone who does just about anything in the kitchen! They are truly amazing...I received this bowl and a set of glass bowls for a bridal shower gift several years ago.  Needless to say I donated the glass bowls to Goodwill and since then have bought the entire set of Oxo Good Grip Bowls.  I use the bowls all the time, and can't believe how nice they are and the non-skid bottom is a life-saver!!!  "
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Machine is not durable.,"After about 1 year of use the pump failed.  As the machine had made acceptable coffee and it looked good on the counter, I spent $60 for service.  About 3 months after that, the control knob stripped.  Well, I've learned my lesson, and will go for a more reputable maker, like Gaggia or Rancilio"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,ike,"the decanter works well with the bunn coffee maker and is included in the price, when you buy the bunn nhb professional coffee maker"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Solid Performer,"Full elastomeric coverage on the underside makes for an extremely stable platform for chef-style acrobatic slicing or just safe, no-slip cutting.  Well designed and made.  Unfortunately the porosity of the elastomer also makes for a mildew-friendly environment.  After 3 years (hand washing only), it simply got too gross and we had to chuck ours out even though the board exhibited minimal any wear and tear"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Watch out!!,I have owned 3 of these (and one of the narrow ones)and every one has snapped in two at the base of the handle with no unusual trauma. Anybody know of another heat-safe spatula out there
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Muffin Pan,"I love this muffin pan! There is no need to grease it, and the muffins come out beautifully - nothing sticks! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Compact yet Large,"My favorite compact Foreman grill.  Has a large cooking area, length and width.  All other compact units lack length especially and could use more width. Cooks chicken breast in 5 minutes, grills just about everything one can imagine.  Easy cleaning, just take a regular paper towel, fold a few times so not to burn fingers, and wipe down right after cooking.  Works better that way then letting it cool.  This is actually my second one, I left my first behind in a move, never again"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Red!!!!,I was low on cookware and saw the red pots and pans and had to have them.  They do exactly what they say they do.  And for once my pasta doesn't stick to the bottom
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,1.0,Don't buy this one . . .,"The picture and description is deceiving.  I thought that I was buying the Bissell that was on display at Wallmart.  The picture and description fit.  Wallmart did not restock their shelves fast enough, so I thought I was buying the same Bissell Cleaner and saving $10 in the meantime.  This on-line version is a much smaller version of the cleaner, with half the power, and the tank capactity does not hold 1/2 gallon as advertised.  If you want to continously fill and empty tanks, then buy this one.  Otherwise, go to Wallmart and get a much better deal on a larger capacity, Larger rollers, and more powerful amp machine for $10 more"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Do NOT buy the Ionic Pro! It is UNHEALTHY & STINKY!,"Before I start, let me write a disclaimer that this might apply to ALL brands of this type, maybe not just the Ionic Pro. (I haven't tried the others.)"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,Quite a Bargain!,This Calphalon One Nonstick Griddle came with a much lower price tag than most Calphalon One Nonstick.  We are finding many uses for it
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love my new pan!,I just love this pan! It heats things beautifully and is easy to clean.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lid
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,i loved it,"The other reviews are right, the color is not as bright as it looks online. I was skeptical of getting it because that was the main complaint on other websites too,so I ordered it early enough so that i could return it if it was that bad. i have to say that i absolutely loved it. the colors are not as rich but they are not faded.i guess i was expecting the worst. i think the set is really nice. you won't get as much space as on regular 10 inch dinner plates because the sides of the plates come up to form the square pattern. there is a set section in the middle of your plate for the food, same with the salad plates. the bowls are bigger than i thought more than enough for a bowl of cereal or side of salad. overall i liked it and so did my mother she wants another set"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,It's All-Clad!,"What can I say, except that it's All-Clad?  We needed a new soup ladle, after our old, cheap one broke after many years of use.  So I decided to splurge a bit and get one that will last.  The stainless steel finish is beautiful (almost makes me not want to use it lest I sully it with fingerprints!), and the ladle fairly heavy and of strong construction."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great purchase!,I bought the knives for my brother who is somewhat of an amateur chef.  I am so happy to say that he was very pleased with the purchase!  I heard complaints of them being flimsy but that is not true at all.  He has also had no problems with rusting and said they work great.  You can tell by the weight of the knives and the handle that they are made very well.  I would recommend this purchase to someone who cooks quite frequently and just wants good knives that get the job done
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,My main pan,"I purchased this pan 2 years ago and actually did so by mistake thinking I was buying a different pan I was looking at.  Well fine - my mistake so kept it and bought the other pan too.  The other one has sat, unused, in my cupboard while I use this DAILY.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Amazing Espresso Machine,I just got this machine from Amazon and it's built like a tank.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Color me impressed!,"This is unbelievably well constructed for the price. It is heavy and sturdy. Loaded with utensils, it makes no attempt to fall over. I was pleasantly surprised considering the very low price"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Quite Satisfied!!,"I actually own pretty much all the serving sets & dishes...  I love the color and get compliments on them all the time...  I've had my place setting for several years.  So far I haven't encountered the chipping many have spoken of, but I can see where you would need to be cautious.  I too agree they are not so great for heating in the microwave, but I really didn't purchase them for that use...  Can't beat the price or the look!"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,A  Great Stainless Steel Cleaner,Cameo was recommended to me by a friend for cleaning my Lustre Craft
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,"great service, great dishes","I placed 2 different orders for a total of 55 place settings of fiestaware, spread across 10 different colors.  The dishes look great. Everything arrived quickly without any hassles &amp; nothing was broken.  People who expect to match color off pictures from the web aren't doing their homework.  Check colors at local stores &amp; you'll know exactly what you'll be getting. There are also a lot of websites with more pictures and detailed color descriptions"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,perfect for little hands,"I have 3 children, the oldest 3 1/2.  I didn't discover this tableware till after my second was feeding himself.  I wish I had found this for when my first was first learning.  I have tons of gerber toddler forks and spoons.  They work pretty well for the most part, but once they are able to get the fork/spoon in their mouth successfully on their own, the shallow spoon looses most of its food on the way to the mouth.  I bought some of the character spoon/fork sets thinking they would be more fun to eat with.  I discovered the spoon is actually LARGER than my own teaspoons that I eat with.  Now tell me, how is my 2 year old supposed to eat with that.  It's like me trying to eat with a serving spoon.  My 2 oldest fight over our Oneida child size silverware, and my 2 year old has much more success and much less mess using them than any other forks or spoons.  I only have 1 set right now, but plan on buying each of my children 2 sets for Christmas, so I will have 7 sets for my children to use.  I will be getting rid of all my gerber ware. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Just my opinion,"I really like this item.  It is easy to use.  I ordered this item and the Jacard 45 blade and comparing the two this is easiest to use.  This one does not stick into the meat as hard as the Jacard blades as I have recently learned. Just punch down and move on.  Its easy to clean.  The only down fall I had with item was after washing it several times, I noticed it started to rust at the base of the tenderizer, but I used W-D 40 and it came off.  I had to rewash but it is still easier to use on meat especially thick and large tri-tips"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,GREAT INFORMAL SET,"We bought these because they were on sale, and it's hard to find black.  At the start, they were suppossed to be temporary."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love it!,"I purchased this on super sale at a local store and have used both pieces and have been very satisfied.  The rotisserie cooked a five lb chicken in 1 1/2 hours as promised.  I took the chicken out and had a knife in hand to serve the chicken, however I grabbed the leg and it just fell off.  The whole family loved it.  I did not find the clean-up to be that dreadful; simply take out the parts and throw them in a sink of soapy water.  Wipe them clean 10 minutes later."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,9 by 12 Sil Pat,This is a very good product. You don't have to grease your pan when you bake. Clean up is very easy
kitchen & housewares,7 of 10,5.0,Hard to Clean at First,"I ordered the Calphalon One 10-inch (just to let you know) Griddle, and it sucked cleaning at first.  There was a residual opaque tint to it.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed with Calphalon One.  I knew I couldn't use the dishwasher, but I did not finish reading the cleaning and maintenance part.  It recommended using ""Barkeeper's Friend"" and a ""Scott's Green Pad"" to clean it that I did not know.  I went to a local mart to pick this stuff figuring it would not be there, and behold there it was.  Bought it, took it home, used ""Barkeeper's Friend"" and ""Scott's Green Pad"" with warm water, and everything came off with ease.  The pan looks like I just pulled it out of the box and I have used it about 20 times.  The opaque look is gone and I am very happy with this product and have since ordered more...  Definitely recommend Calphalon One"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 9,2.0,Not very good,"I thought I waw buying decent quality, but not so.  These are basically like putting a white Hanes t-shirt on your pillow"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Almost a hit.,"I was a little surprised with this set. Don't get me wrong, you should buy it, but the edge lacked a little of the visual refinement of the rest of the line. Also, the block of wood shipped with the knives is made of pine, or some other very soft wood. It would be nice if it was a Maple match to the block that shipped with the 15 piece set. This is a very good set, but it could use a little help upon arrival with a very fine whetstone, and a proper hardwood block. If you don't mind 2 minutes per blade with an ultra fine stone, this set compares well with the best of the two big homegrown German brands. Don't get me wrong, this set is far above any stamped steel set (even the stamped offerings from the big German brands). Buy it and enjoy"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Ease of use,"I wanted something different than a grating tower, and I got something that fits in your hand and makes it comfortable to grate"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Great fan...but ""goofy"" operation","The only reason I didn't give this fan 5 stars is because figuring out all the buttons is a bit much.  You can set everything to high, but then it will run high, then run low, then run high again.  We have yet to figure out the right combination of selections.  But, it does work remarkably well - better than any box fan we've ever owned.  If you can find a good deal, it's definately worth purchasing"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Juicer,The Breville works great.  Very powerful and easy to clean.  I would reccomend this juicer
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,First impressions,"I actually wound up buying mine from Sears, beause I needed a few pairs of jeans also, but I'll make some comments."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Whee!  Wonderful Whisker!,Indeed this item is the greatest. Never have I made such fluffy pancakes! Easy to clean and feels comfortable in your hand.  Alsgreat for keeping your holiday gravy from lumping
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Difficult to find elsewhere,Plenty of plain Jane Corelle sets available outside but the colored and patterned ones are difficult to find. Great price at Amazon too. Can't be beat. If only these were stovetop safe. But that's asking for too much.
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,"Cast Iron for Dummies (and Smarties, too)","One of the most important things to consider when buying anything cast iron is its weight, and therefore, balance.   Never use your wrist alone to pick up a heavy skillet, use part of your arm as well. Because for its inherent weight, it is very important for cast iron cookware to be properly balanced. You should be able to put part of the skillets handle just past your wrist so that your arm is providing partial support.  The pan should feel balanced this way."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Nice set,"Very simple sturdy set so far, the buffet server caddy is a nice extra bonus.  Good value, would recommend"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Wonderful product,"These tongs are easy on the hands and grip food well.  I have the All Clad tongs too and while they are more beautiful, these run rings around them based on ease of use.  They operate very smoothly and I am never concerned about dropping food.  I use these mainly for my nonstick skillet, but they get used in my other skillets as well"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,As fragile as a celebrities ego,"While I liked the style of this product, there is no doubt that it breaks extremely easily. Unfortunately that is one of the flaws of the Braun carafe and probably why Braun has discontinued making the coffee maker which utilizes this carafe"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,You have to re-learn the art of cooking.,"I have this and several other all-clad stainless pans.  For anyone looking to purchase a stainless pan and move away from teflon coated or lower quality cookware, all-clad stainless is a must.  They are expensive, but well worth the cost. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent Electric Skillet,"This skillet is a manageable size and not heavy even with the glass lid.  It is easy to clean, the thermostat works well and can be used for so many things from soups, eggs, pancakes and one dish meals of all types"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Very good mixer for the price,I must admit that I did not have high expectations for this mixer for the price.  But the unit works very well.  I was initially put off by the beaters as they seem very lightweight and flimsy.  But they hold up well to use in spite of their lack of heft.  I have been very happy with it
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Wonderful!,"I purchased the Panini Press for a Father's Day gift for my husband.  I was very interested in the Breville brand because I purchased their toaster a few months ago and the design and function is outstanding!  Anyway, my husband likes leftover pizza for lunch and doesn't like it in the microwave.  Consequently, he often gets out our heaviest pan and turns the flame on high underneath it and...WALKS AWAY!  The phone rings, he lets the dogs out, whatever:  there is always something to distract him and our kitchen smells like burnt to a crisp pizza!  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,ARTHUR COURT GRAPE 20-DEVILED EGG HOLDER,"ABSOLUTELY STUNNING ITEM!!  GREAT PRESENTATION, SELLER HAD WONDERFUL E-MAILS, GREAT PACKAGING, FAST AND SAFE SHIPMENT.  IT WAS AN EXTREME PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THIS SELLER"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,4.0,"Easy to use, flavor not as great as it could be...",This filter is great and easy to use but I have noticed that the flavor of the coffee is not as good.  It has a bit of an instant taste.  I imagine that the Keurig K-Cups are processed to allow for a quick brew and using this filter with your standard coffee does not allow for the same flavor
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,low the sugar creamer set,I low this set.  Whenever I have company or just everyday it is a nice way to present a complete coffee or tea service

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"I know, I know, it's just a measuring cup! ","I must be getting old, as today I dropped my Pyrex 1 Quart Measuring Cup from a cupboard about 10 feet up and guess what, it didn't break, and I was very excited! I've bought dozens of measuring cups over the years and have managed to melt, break, tarnish and mutilate each and every one of them. This one seems to be up to the challenge. I've used it to melt butter and left it in the microwave too long, washed it a dozen times in the dishwasher, used a whisk in it (I love the sheer size of this thing!). Not a scratch on it! I know, I know, it's just a measuring cup. But quality does matter, and this one is top notch"

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Great Coffeemaker!,"I hesitate to say how long I've had this coffeemaker and jinx it but it's been many years and still working perfectly!  If it stopped working tomorrow, I'd buy the exact same one!  The timer and clock are very easy to program and I love being able to decide how long the hot plate stays on.  I used to use bottled water and the duofilter lasted much longer...I use tap water now and the coffee still tastes great.  Amazon.com and linensandthings.com also sell the duofilters.  The only thing I didn't like- in the beginning it was hard to put the lid on the pot...once I learned the trick- put the front down first, then snap the back into place it is a piece of cake.  "

kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Most Used Attachment,"This is the attachment I use more than any other on my kitchenaid. In fact, I leave this attached. Every part of this is made with quality steel and the item is surprizingly heavy for its size. It never has a problem opening ANY can, even ones with dented rims, or those somewhat rectangular with pull tabs that broke off instead of opening, and the magnet holds the lid when you remove the can. It takes about 5 seconds to open any can and is easy to clean with a damp paper towel without removing it from the mixer though it comes off easier than any other attachment I have. It stands out much farther than I expected (about 4 inches) from the machine, but I suppose that this is so the can won't come near the bowl or shield. It makes using the cover difficult to put on and even more difficult to remove, so I gave up on the cover. I haven't found a better can opener either manual or electric. I highly reccomend this"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,A really great machine!,"I have owned this machine for over a year now and it has been great! I've cooked at least a hundred chickens and more than a few pork roasts and it has worked perfectly every time. The reflective backplate does stain but that doesn't affect performance. Use a 4.5 to 5 lb. bird. Learning how to attach a bird to the spit is very important. Wrap one elastic rotisserie tie around the feet to keep the drumsticks together and another around the body to keep the wings in place. Place the chicken on the counter with the drumsticks up and run the long part of the spit through the bird at the head and place the end cap at the other end as snugly as possible. Use the recipe for the deli rotisserie mix in the manual and cook it for 90 to 120 minutes, depending on how well done you prefer your chicken and you will LOVE it! After use, soak the parts for a while and use a nylon brush and cleanup will be easier. "

So I had little expectations.  Boy, was I surprised.  It worked better than the cuisinart electric. I must say the texture and consistency was perfect. The ice cream was ready in 35 minutes.  I'll keep this one and look forward to many more batches of homemade ice cream"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,4.0,Nice and less pricey now...alternatives,"My friends have one of these that I've used and it is very nice, but I could not handle the price (a year or more ago).  After some searching, I found the Hitachi RZST10Y fuzzy rice cooker and ordered it at $89.  They have only 1 US reseller so far as I can tell.  It has been great.  The same ""fire-and-forget"" function.  Now that Zojirushi prices aren't quite so inflated, I would consider them next time. But hmmm., I did not know until I stopped here that the ""Z"" models will need to have their internal battery surgically replaced in future.  I need to see if the Hitachi has a user-replaceable battery.  That was something I was not aware of with these and not sending it back to NYC in 3 years would be a plus :)"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,2.0,who wants to drink coffee grounds??,"I use a french press for fresh coffee while camping.  I had been using a glass Bodum french press, which worked great but it was only a 3 cup press and i was afraid it would break eventually... so i was looking for something bigger and more heavy duty.  so, i bought the thermos, which is not all I thought it would be.  It says a quart, but it's only maybe 3-4 cups of coffee... and for my big camping mugs, it's hardly 3 cups.  Also, the filter does not work properly and there are many grounds in every cup... YUK!  So, Memorial Day weekend when I went to pour coffee for my and my buddies, we were very disappointed in my new press... sure it keeps it hot longer, but we were planning on drinking the coffee... and it's not as big as we thought it was... size does matter in the morning when you want your coffee... and when you have to pour out 1/3 of the coffee because of grounds... well, we aren't impressed!"

I was so happy for my wife as it would make her life so much easier. I read the instructions and we got ready to chop some veggies. My wife kept cutting everything small, I told her you don't need to cut everything so small. We placed small pieces in the processor and it continually stopped working. I was very frustrated by how little it took to stop the blades. This thing is going back and I will not be buying a Black and Decker. In the end it turned our excitement into major frustration"

kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Zojirushi make great and very useful product,"I brought 1 of these and I am buying second one for my road trip.  I didn't get Mr Bento because this one is bigger.  Company's lunch cost about 7-8 bucks.  I use this for 2 weeks, it already pay me back.  Usually every morning I fill them up and microwaved the food.  Use hot sink water to heated it then dump the water.  Then put the food inside and at lunch time food are hot like just come out of the microwave oven.  Sometime I didn't have time pour hot water in in in the morning but the hot food I put inside still stay hot at lunch time.  I normally carry it in my briefcase, I don't know how they made it fit perfectly so small. I normally leave it vertically in my car on the passenger seat, once I left it horzontallly but it only leaks couple drops of liquid from top container, not big deal! The middle container is rice and the bottom is sealed tight, no leak at all.  I brought anther one for my dad.  I'm buying 2nd one for myself since I normally drive from chicago to michigan once a month.  This will save me lot of $ at MacDonald or any other fast food place alone the road.  Hot food on the road! save$!   I love it! "

Other than that don't waste your time"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,Cordless,"I was pleasantly surprised the iron was heavier than I anticipated.  The iron is very basic so just reading the information on the iron suffices for the owner's manual.  The one draw back is it does not hold heat long.  Basically any time you would sit your iron down to reposition the item being ironed, you must remember to set it on the base or you will discover it no longer steams. "

kitchen & housewares,25 of 25,4.0,Petite Beauty,"I have just received the Royal Albert Old Country Roses footed bowl and am delighted with this ""petite beauty"".  It is the perfect size for serving smaller quantities, I ordered it hoping it wouldn't be too large. The description is unclear as to size and indicates under the features section that it is an ""elegant footed centerpiece bowl"". This caused me to envision a much larger bowl, the kind you might put on your side board or in the center of your table filled with fruit or flowers. Beware if that is what you are looking for, the actual size  is 3 1/2 inches tall by 6 5/8 inches in diameter and has a volume of 3 1/2 cups. I give it 4 stars, 5 stars for the item minus 1 star for the lightweight description"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,A must have for every kitchen,"After comparing the various food processors in store and online from the reviews my decision was very simple: I went with the KitchenAid over the Cuisinart.  After having used it several times I am very happy with my purchase.  First made a marinara and used the shredder for the carrots and that went so fast and smooth I was in disbelief.  Then I reassembled it with the main blade and threw in the tomatoes, onion and garlic and everything was minced down to almost a puree status almost immediately with very little sound.  A dead bang winner in my book."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best little spatula ever!,I just ordered another one of these little spatulas.  Found that having one was just not enough sometimes.  I love them -- they are very comfortable in your hand and do a great job cleaning out bowls.  Every working kitchen should have at least one of these.  Nice too that you can cook with them although I mostly use mine in baking efforts.  Prefer bamboo spatulas for cooking. 
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Incredible for the price,"Most of my knives are Henckels and until this little gem arrived, my 8"" chef and my 8"" slicer got all the action. I don't have any other santoku knives so when I ran into this I decided that at that price it was worth a try. I'm glad I did because it's been my #1 all-around most-used knife since it arrived, and I do a lot of cooking - daily meals for my family of five, plus a weekly dinner party. Cuts veggies, even tomatoes, into perfect thin slices with no trouble. I even used it to filet an entire 12-lb salmon into steaks for freezing! It's well-made, sharp, and balanced - Quite a dandy little knife at the price"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,"inexpensive, and very, very, good non-stick",I was pleasantly surprised when I received this pan.  This is the unstickiest piece of cookware I have ever owned.  Even I could flip crepes into the air with a flick of the wrist!  Crepes are fun to make and so yummy.  My picky 8 year old brother ate all that I could make and asked for more
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,2.0,Boils fast but this is a flawed kettle,"Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A Great Mixing Bowl,"Okay, let's not get too excited over a common mixing bowl, but, this bowl is better than the ""standard"" glass or metal mixing bowls I used to have. The greatest feature is the rubberized bottom which prevents the bowl from easliy slipping on the counter while mixing. The handle is nice and a pour spout that actually works."

kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,1.0,Made in China plates do not match original Made in Mexico,"I love my Pistoulet tableware, but dinner service was originally manufactured in Mexico, and the new ""Made in China"" plates do not look anywhere near as lovely.  Originals had swirling, translucent glazed rims and details.  Made in China looks like a poor copy - colors solid and garish, details like the fluer de lis look stamped on rather than hand-painted.  What a huge disappointment"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great knife,Various cooking shows recommend this style knife and it is everything they say it is.  It is excellent
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great product for busy mornings,"I was one of those people who thought at first this was a dumb idea for an appliance, but reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  I've been using it a week now and it's definitely a winner!  Cooks perfectly every time, very well thought out.  I haven't tried the poacher yet but the medium eggs are great (white cooked, yolk soft).  The egg holder tray is a bit tricky to clean but I give the product 5 stars.  It's a permanent fixture in the morning routine and it has a very small footprint which is great for compact urban apartment living.  Timer works well and is loud enough to hear from the next room.  Easy to carry the eggs to the sink to run under cold water"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,"Does the job, its made to do.","I have been using this for about 2 months and am very pleased with it.  I originally was looking at the Cuisinart TOB-165 mainly because it was white and it was recommended by Consumer Reports.  However, after sifting through all the reviews, I found more complaints and unsatisfied users, that I steered away from it and chose this product based upon the reviews. It bakes evenly and the toast comes out toasted on both sides.  It's user friendly, cleans well and the crumb tray is in the front.  The few minor flaws would be 1) no light 2) the racks have no stops, so you must be careful when pulling them out and 3) When toasting or broiling, the heat creates droplets of moisture around the inside door edges which are hard to get off.  I can live with all of that because it functions nicely and does it's job"
kitchen & housewares,32 of 32,5.0,Ease and Excellence in Rolling Pastry/Cookie Dough,"With the Vic Firth 12-Inch Marble Rolling Pin, I do not hesitate to make my own pie crusts and rolling out any other type of pastry/cookie dough is very easy and a pleasure.  This is the best rolling pin I've every used and  the third one I've owned.  Because of the marble surface, the dough remains  cool and at an even temperature, allowing you to work with the dough easily  - the dough remains consistent in texture and does not stick to the rolling  pin.  The rolling pin is also very easy to clean and store.  It's a great  product for whatever your &quot;rolling&quot; needs may be.  I lent my  rolling pin to my mother and I think she's going to keep it and I'll have  to purchase another one.  Without hesitation, I would purchase this product  again and I would give it as a gift"
kitchen & housewares,31 of 32,1.0,Please...SAVE YOUR MONEY,"What a disappointment.  I am a huge Kitchenaid fan and I can't believe the poor quality of this toaster oven.  As others have said, the finish is poor...the paint is not smooth and is chipping off around the oven door straight out of the box.  The stainless steel trim is rough and cheap looking; it seems poorly machined.  As for the performance, toasting is totally aggravating since the top element gets MUCH hotter than the bottom.  The timer is cheap and the ""ticking"" is annoying.  When the timer ends, the bell is out of synch.  There is no on/off switch; just the timer to control the oven.  I expected MUCH more from a toaster oven in this price range.  I was happier with my old Toastmaster that cost about $40 and lasted for years.  You can do much better than this for considerably less money. "

I give this pre-seasoned version as wedding gifts, housewarming gifts, and to those kids stepping out into their own apartments. Cast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money, and this pre-seasoned version takes the hassle out of ""getting it ready to use.""

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Poor Toasting,"Despite the reviews I read about this product and being a proud owner of an older Cuisinart Convection Oven, I order this product with high expections.  To our dismay, the first oven we received did not produce equally browed toast - the top side always seemed to be darker than the botton regardless of how the tray was situated.  We decided to return the oven and the replacement produced the same results - unequal browning when toasting.  My conversations with Cuisinart were not helpful and the representative I spoke with instructed me to return the oven again for a replacement, however Amazon has since informed me that they will not allow another replacement since there may be a wider spread issue.  So, it looks like I will be returning this oven for a refund and looking for a replacement from another manufacturer.  While others mention issues with toasting, I wish my experience was as positive as the other reviews I read and with my previous Cuisinart Toaster oven. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Not fancy, but a mainstay","I'm on my second one - the first lasted five years.  For two people and weekly use, it's held up very well for it's price.  Rice can stick to the bottom of the pan, but a little soaking or a shot or two of Power Dissolver does the trick just fine.  I've had no problems with jasmine, basmati, sushi, arborio or brown rice, and I also do couscous and soups in it."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This is a great pepper mill!,   All the reviews were right. This is the best pepper mill I've ever bought. It grates the pepper corns very fine the way I like them and is very easy to fill.  I think that it's well worth the price I paid.

It's really beautiful and very well designed.  The kettle is sturdy and works well while adding to my kitchen decor.  I won't go into the perfomance specifics which are excellent, because the other reviewers convinced me to purchase this product and I am 100% satisfied"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Don't question it, just buy it!","AWESOME toaster oven and I love how quickly it will toast/cook my food.  I am a bachelor that likes things cooked quickly out of the freezer, but don't really want that microwave taste. This was the perfect addition to my kitchen counter. Sleek silver finish! My only complaint is the cord that sticks out of the right side of the unit, but otherwise a great toaster oven"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,"Beautiful bone china, great buy!","I love these dishes, I bought these because I need more dishes to go with a set that is patterned but the basic color is white, they mix with the set beautifully!   I like the feel of the classic Wedgewood bone china so I'm glad they priced this set so I can afford to use them for everyday dishes. The packing left alot to be desired very flimsy boxes, but surprising everything made to me in one piece, so I'm very happy with my purchase"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Coffee shop coffee,"    I bought this unit 6 or 7 years ago and have loved it ever since.  Features like the programmable timer, water heat selection, self clean are all useful, but what makes this a great coffee maker is that it grinds the coffee and passes hot water through it within seconds of finishing the grind.  That you can program this so you can have fresh ground and brewed coffee waiting for you in the morning is one of the finer things in life.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Awesome!,"This pan makes a beautiful cake!  Instead of using cooking spray to grease the pan, I brushed it with Crisco, using a silicon basting/pastry brush (wow are those great - they easily get into all these nooks & crannies and the bristles don't fall out like they do with the 'natural' ones), then I dusted the pan with flour thoroughly.  The cake came out with ease, and almost perfectly-formed.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love it,"It's the first grill pan that has worked for me.  Hamburgers, filets,steaks, have all turned out beautifully.  I have a gas stove - don't know if that makes a difference, but I am buying one for my daughter-in-law."

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,2.0,It's Okay.,"I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about with this product. I'm a total kitchen gadget junkie and so I was delighted when I received this for Christmas. Yes, it's more ergonomic to hold and it's a little easier for me to slice up small bits of pizza for my toddler, but it's not *all that*. The problem is the thing is so irritating to wash that I find myself just reaching for my regular pizza cutter instead of this one. Basically you have to take it out of its plastic case to wash it which can be rather tricky. I keep worrying I'm going to slice myself with the blade. Even putting it back together after it's clean is a bit nerve racking. Frankly all this business of taking it apart and putting it together sort of nullifies the ergonomic aspect of it for me."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect for its job!,"I bought this little coffee maker for a group of 4 people that work near me.  We all love to have our coffee right there, and not in the break room downstairs.  The coffee tastes fine, and the design is unintrusive.  Very pleased with its simplicity"

This mug is absolutely the best.  7 years and no drips, unless the gasket is not seated correctly.  I just wish I could have an even bigger mug so I can take more coffee with me in the morning.  I'm looking at the bigger Thermos, but I loved this one so much, my decision is a tough one"
kitchen & housewares,39 of 39,5.0,Typical All-Clad quality!,"I have tried several stove top grills, so I feel qualified to comment on this one.  First I bought the non-stick aluminum Nordicware grill, which worked ok till the non-stick peeled.  Next I tried the LeCreuset, which was sooooo heavy, hard to clean, and began to develop rust spots.  Next was the Lodge Logic, which was similar to the LeCreuset, but cheaper.  (Too heavy and hard to clean.)  Finally, I purchased this All-Clad Grande Grille Pan, which is the largest of the lot.  It cooks evenly over two burners on my gas stove and cleans up easily with a little soaking.  So far, this grill out performs any of the others and I am finally HAPPY with my purchase!  (If you are a Foodie, you may notice Giada DeLaurentis using this same grill on ""Everyday Italian"".)  If you are in the market for a quality stove-top grill, this one won't disappoint you"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Kitchen Basic,"A large stock pot is a must for every kitchen.  This 12 quart stockpot is large enough for soups, pastas, corn on the cob.  Cooit and freeze it.  Dinner will always be just a trip to the freezer.  Fantastic for working people. Great for crowds. Most sets come with an 8 quart pot.  You'll love the extra large size in anodized aluminum.  Hard to come by. Makes a wonderful gift for everyone who cooks"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,A great start to a good kitchen,"Theis set gives a good start for premium cookware. The brushed exterior is great if you don't like to polish your pots and pans all the time. I've found MC2 to the be the best in terms of  balancing maintenance and quality of cooking. I have a few other pans that are coper or cast iron, but the majority of my cooking is now done in the these (and a few supplement pieces) of the MC2 line"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A+ Highly Recommended!!!,"I've owned this set for 5 years now and have nothing but good things to say! I use my pots daily and I hand wash for the most part, only because it is so effortless to get them clean. I use only bamboo or plastic ware on it, so scratching has never been a problem. The handles on the pots and lids do get hot so keep those ovenmits handy! The cooking is fantastic! I can cook all day long on high and not burn anything! The size is really great especially if you have a big family you are cooking for. I've not tried them in the oven, because I have ovenware, but I know they are safe up to 500F. I highly recommend this set, you will not be disapointed! :-"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,2.0,Surprised...I thought it was a Ktchenaid,I've purchased a Kitchenaid blender and food processor this year and since then stocked my kitchen with KA utensils since i equate the Kitchenaid name with high quality. Unfortunately this item like so many other Chinese-made pieces where companies slap their name onto it doesnt stand up. I noticed it was staining where the silicon head met the plastic handle and then a few weeks later a tear developed and then it was gone. This item was 2 weeks old and didnt serve any more strenuous duty than mixing batter or stirring a sauce.  I may try the French Made Le Creuset Spatulas next. Ive learned that regardless of the name check on the quality and where it is manufactured

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Victory ,"I turned the device onto human sound because on sub-sonic, I didn't get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor's two daschund dogs barked early in the morning.  The device itself on human sound was triggered by many things, air condtioner, mower, air plane, thunder, etc. which was not good in that I doubt it would serve as an effective training device. The dogs seemed to trigger it at random times.  We have large lots here in this area of NJ and I placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem.  HOWEVER, my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole I placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs' outside times. She advised me that her book clubs (inside) and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly.  The capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation. I would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Great bottle, not so great straw","I purchased the children's model of this water bottle for my boys and it is great.  It keeps the water cold, never leaks and is very durable.  My only issue is with the bendable straw.  It breaks easily and even though there was a replacement included in my bottles, it only took two months for 3 of the 4 to be broken.  But not to worry, replacements are available now through the manufacturer.  You can get the customer service phone number for Thermos from their website and order as many replacements as your heart desires. "

Being vegan there's no worry about whether these are suitable for cutting up chickens or any other dead animals cause it just ain't gonna happen at my house. I use them for all kinds of kitchen tasks and will be buying more to use all around the house. Great buy for the money. "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,A useful and convenient tool,"The meat thermometer is easy-to-use, and the magnetic base makes it easy to place the main unit close to the oven or the grill.

We have burned out engines on numerous other blenders and decided to try one with more power.  This ""professional"" model has held up to the task and we love it!  It pulverizes ice and all sorts of frozen fruits with incredible ease, creating wonderfully blended smoothies with no residual ""chunks"" of fruit.  The guys in the family refer to it as ""a man's power tool"". "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Great purchase!,"I recently purchased this and feel I got a good deal.  The set is made from a popular, reputable company and the price was great - $89.99.  I didn't realize it came with a simple utensil set, which made for an excellent surprise!  The holes in the lids are very useful in draining.  This would be perfect as a house warming gift or as a first timer's set.  :"

It got squeaky and a little more difficult to use. I thought it was just the one I had, but I had ordered two. I tried out the other one and it had the same problem. Other than that, it's a pretty good tool. It did make nice looking cookies and meatballs"

Returning the defective product could not have been easier and a new oven was in the mail even before I could make the return
kitchen & housewares,24 of 26,4.0,"Great pan, but why can't we buy  the parts separately?","A good pan; great for cheesecakes, or any other kind of cakes (doesn't work for Jello salad, though!).  It comes in 2 parts; the base, and the wall part. The buckle on the wall part is VERY sturdy, and the wall is reversible, so it's jusat as easy to use whether you're right-handed or left-handed.  But I inadvertently scratched the base (it's easy to do!), and it seems there's no way to just buy another base without buying the whole unit.  So if you buy one, be CAREFUL not to scratch the base; don't get a metal knife anywhere near it! Maybe they should include a non-stick plastic knife; it would be a nice touch"

My boyfriend (an expert cook) has the 7 and 8 inch santoku from Henkels in his knife set, which I thought were way too big for me.  I am really happy with this 5 inch.  You can cut everything from vegetables to meat with it.  He thought the knife would be too small for him, but he loves to use it when he comes over to cook.  Its crazy sharp and the slightly rounded edge rocks it really nice over vegetables and pretty much everything else.  I love this knife"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,No more broken blad assemblies!,I received this blender three weeks ago.  I was desperate to find a blender for which I wouldn't have to replace the blade assembly every three months and mop up a mess every time I used the blender (from things leaking out under the blender).
kitchen & housewares,33 of 33,4.0,Good little grinder,"Years ago used a standard spinning blade grinder for my coffee. Though it was better than pre-ground, eventually decided the gain was minor and it was not worth the hassle.  Have not wanted to spend $200 for the top-line burr grinders, but saw some good reviews of the La Pavoni.  I've had it for about a month now; my wife and I are very pleased.  Some reviews I've seen talk about it spattering coffee ground dust in the area - have had no problems like that.  The coffee is noticeably better and fresher tasting and the grinder is very convenient to use.  Don't have to stand there and hold the lid down and try to guess when it has been ground to the right consistency.  Just set the number of cups you want ground, put the beans in the hopper, turn it on and walk away.  And the burr grinding does seem to improve flavor more than the old blade grinder did (and even more of an improvement compared to pre-ground"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Works as Advertised.,"I was perusing the Amazon sight and noticed this item's reviews.  I do not know what the previous reviewers were trying to grate, nails?  And by the way, soft, soft cheeses are better sliced anyway.  This is a relatively delicate tool and should be handled as such.  Accordingly, it will not break.  I have had this grater for approximately one year and it has worked flawlessly.  I use it to grate hard parmesan cheese and then refrigerate the remaining cheese in the grater.  When all the cheese is used, I simply disassemble, wash, dry, and store the grater until its next use.  This is how it is advertised to work.  I have found this grater to be a handy gadget to have in my kitchen gadgets inventory."

Just let it cool off and wiped it with some paper towels and soapy water.  I highly suggest that every human run out and buy this item.

kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,5.0,Excellent product,"The Bodum Eileen 4-cup Coffee Press is the perfect way to make just the right amount of coffee for one or two people.  In regards to the other review, I don't agree that the heading is misleading.  I have never seen a coffee pot or maker that listed the number of cups based on the 8 oz measuring cup.  In coffee terms a cup is usually 4 or 5 ounces per 'cup'.  The number of cups is really the number of regular servings not fluid ounces.  And with that in mind this product is perfect for making great coffee with out brewing a full sized pot which most of sits to long to enjoy"

kitchen & housewares,10 of 13,2.0,Beautiful but not reliable,"I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect for the job!,"This pan is perfect at what it does.  It fits in my toaster easily, and has not experienced any peeling or warping.  Non-stick is easy to use and easy to clean.  I'm perfectly content with this product"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,5.0,Simply Amazing,I have yet to be disappointed by any product from Breville. I am a proud owner of the juice fountain and now the wok. Hands down the best electric wok I have ever used. If you are surfing reviews searching for a wok or for that matter any kitchen appliance start at the breville website. Own just one product and you'll become a fan as well

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I Have Three,"I have read reviews on these and I can not believe people break them or melt their handles. They are flexable and the end of the handle is plastic. They are a heafty size and if you are not using a large non-stick frypan things could be difficult. I use a 10.5 x 10.5 square scan pan twice a day. I've turned over several 16 oz steaks without a break and I would never leave the handle of any turner on the edge of a hot pan. My only critisism would be the colors; blue is really purple and red is really maroon. Why 5 stars? They clean like a dream, will probably last forever and I don't have to buy new plastic ones every other week because their finish has worn off"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Love the new handle!,"I almost bought a Good Grips meat fork with a rubber handle until I saw this one. I love Good Grips kitchen tools, and have come to depend on the brand when I'm looking for a nice, solid, reasonably priced kitchen tool. However, in the past, my one complaint has been that when I store utensils in a crock next to the stove, those non-slip handles that I love stick together, and it becomes impossible to grab just one tool - you wind up pulling out 6. This handle fixes that problem. It still has the nice, comfortable handle with rubber on either side for grip, but the stainless steel is much easier to grab quickly out of the crock. I'll definately be looking for more tools with this handle. The fork itself is nice and sturdy, a good size, and handles well. I would reccommend this product"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Love it!,"I love this little kettle.  It has a gauge on the side so you can see how much water remains.  (Prevents you from boiling it dry!)  Because it's round, you can turn it any direction you want (no more steam under the cupboard!)"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Great gift for a wine buff!,"I bought this for my wife, who is a bit of a wine buff.  She was a little afraid of it at first (she's not a ""gadget"" type of person), but now that she's gotten used to it she's crazy about it.  It opens bottles with incredible ease and speed, and never goes in crooked or breaks the cork.  You'll throw away all your other corkscrews after trying this"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,LOVE IT!!!!,"We have had our machine for over two years and we are still as much in live with it as when we first bought it! We have started a trend among family and friends and these machines are popping up in all their kitchens.  Wonderful news for us because it means we have fab coffee when we visit them.  We don't have a concern with changing bean types frequently but, it would be nice to have a larger water tank and grounds drawer(mostly because I am the only who remembers to refill/empty the machine).  Highly recommended."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Kamenstein Paper Towel Holder,"I had bought a similar item by Kamenstein at my local discount store.  It had a lightweight base and tipped if you pulled too hard, but the ratcheting mechanism worked well.  It just took 2 hands.  So, when I saw this one with the heavy base, I jumped at the chance to try it. I am very pleased with the purchase.  It works as advertised and can easily be operated with just one hand. Unlike so many other holders, this one does not have any post or bar except for the center one that holds the cardboard tube, so you can put any size roll of towels on it.  Mine came packed very well and in excellent shape.   It is so much more attractive than the old plastic type that the contractor had screwed into the bottom of the cupboard.  Now, the only problem I see is that the perforations on some brands of paper towels are almost nonexistent.  The paper towel holder works great.  The only problem I ever encounter is with the quality of the paper towels themselves"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great  Release,"This is my official egg pan -- even if I'm only cooking one.  The nonstick finish is great.   I haven't had any problems with it.  I like the fact that I can get the All-Clad even heat technology with a non-stick surface.  Because of the non-stick surface, the pan is not dishwasher safe.  However, it's so easy to clean that you don't even think about it.  "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,4.0,"It slices, it dices... it scrapes!","Yes, it's good at what it does: scraping. As an added bonus, there are measurements on the scraper in case you really need to get precise with the dough you're scraping off the counter. This thing does a great job of cleaning up the countertop after kneading bread and getting flour all over the place. So it really does do more than scraping: you can use it to divide dough, clean gunk off the counter, release sticky dough from a smooth countertop, measuring something that's less than 4"" long, fight ninjas, etc"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,excellent value,These baking dishes are an excellent value. The 2 quart is the perfect size for casseroles and small roasts. The 3 quart is also great for baking cakes and clean up is a breeze. The price is also a great deal. I priced these in stores before finding them on amazon and each time the price was almost double for both pieces. An excellent value!
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Beautiful heavy-duty set,"I just received 2 sets of the Corelle Hearthstone in the green for my birthday (yes it is what I wanted and not a dumb husband buy).  They are beautiful and very heavy.  Definitely do not feel like a cheap set of dishes here.  The plates fit just fine in my cabinets with no room to spare.  I love the fact that the ""lunch plates"" are just right for a normal meal and not small saucers to go under the mugs.  I'll probably use the lunch plates a lot for our dinners or else we are going to get very fat.  I am looking forward to curling up on the couch with a good book and a large mug full of hot chocolate.  I think I already wish I'd gotten a 3rd set for when we have company over.  Christmas isn't that far away..."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Stay or Go Coffee Maker a hit with me,"I love this coffee maker.  Not only does the coffee taste good, but it is kept warm for a long time in the carafe.  I didn't think I would use the travel mugs, but now I often make only one mug of coffee instead of a whole carafe just to drink at home--very handy.  If you buy this product, I think you will be very pleased with it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,4.0,nice-looking teakettle,this is a very nice-looking teakettle.  It heats quickly - and holds the water hot for quite awhile.  It's fairly heavy in weight.  I would recommend this teakettle if you are looking for a good one that looks nice on your stove top
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful!,"We used to use a fork to pierce the meat we were going to cook.  I was shopping for Christmas presents at a local kitchen shop and found this wonderful little gadget.  As it turns out my mother thought it was just as great and also bought it for him.  I decided to keep the one I purchased for myself, and I love it; we use all of the time.  It is great for both dry rubs and marinades"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,WONDERFUL. Changed how I cook!,"I am totally thrilled.  For breakfast every morning I cook Old-Fashioned oatmeal with apple and cinnamon in it and for dinner rice with spices, veggies, shrimp or fish and have a meal in a pot. I highly recommend The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufman which has amazing recipes.  The pan inside has very slippery non-stick coating which I carefully wash by hand.  I rinse my rice first which is how you prevent the spitting that some people report. You MUST wash the rice to get the starch off.  Cooks brown and mixed brown and wild rice wonderfully. Great for 1 or 2 people"

I will definitely add more silicone to my baking collection"

kitchen & housewares,9 of 11,5.0,My Mug Of Choice,"The rich and beautiful red of this mug was what first caught my eye as I lazily surfed through Amazon's tempting wares. That would co-ordinate nicely with my apple-themed kitchen, I thought. Then I saw the buttery yellow, the blue of my husband's eyes, the cinnabar of a desert ridge, the green of a grassy valley, the purple of some pleasant purple thing which I cannot think of. I ordered the entire range of colors immediately. Upon opening the box, I found a mug of great beauty, strength, and comfort to my hand. The rings are sensual ridges that perfectly balance the smooth upper half of the mug. Visually, the mug is stunning, when the intense matte color is right before your eyes in the natural play of light and shadow. These mugs have made my kitchen more beautiful, as they sit upon their shelf -- when they get the chance to rest, and not serve my friends and I in their splendid rainbow'd livery. These mugs are solid, earthy, dignified, comforting, and satisfying. They accomodate my large strong hands well. My father also finds them quite comfortable. If you suffer from arthritis, this mug is not for you. It is quite heavy, and might be painful and awkward to handle. There is no good in spoiling a delicious brew of tea or coffee, or distracting from a whipped-cream-topped mug of fragrant hot cocoa, with pain for tender swollen hands from a too-heavy mug. Another word of warning -- the bigger they are, the harder they fall. I am sad to report that I dropped my green mug upon my battered linoleum floor, and it did not do well at all, heavy as it is. In fact, it shattered entirely beyond repair. I have not replaced it, as it was something of a modern shade of green for my taste. Greens do fall prey to the latest trend, don't they? This green does not accent my eyes at all. But it did look nice amongst the others, and my red-haired friend liked it very much. She appreciates the latest greens. But now she must settle for cinnabar. "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Is It Possible To Love A Small Household Appliance?,"...Because I think I love you, Panasonic NIC76SR Steam Iron.  This iron is heavy enough to get the creases out of corduroy pants but also has a light touch for any delicate items.  It's easy to fill, easy to clean, has a safety mode so you don't burn your house down--if only it would fold the laundry and walk the dog!  I recommend this iron without reservations. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 12,4.0,Griddle Is Worth The Price Of The Set Alone,"Cookware is used for cooking so if you're more concerned with presentation and rather you can throw this pan through a wall with it still being easy-to-use then this review won't help you much. I've used heavier pans and lighter pans with all kinds of handles but the bottom line is if it gets the job done. These pans get it done. The pans are light but that doesn't suggest a lack of quality. The griddle is fantastic and heats evenly even on smaller burners (like mine). The griddle is versatile, so much so that I used it for pancakes in the morning and 4 large burgers at night. The cleaning is amazingly simple but I would suggest cleaning it right after the pan cools (much easier that way). A few problems though: Amazon lists the two fry pans as 8 inches and 10 inches. The packaging for the pans listed them as 8 inches and 9 inches. In fact, I bought an 8 inch and 10 inch lid for the pans and while the 8 inch lid fit perfectly on the 8 inch pan the 10 inch lid was too big on the ""10 inch"" pan. This, in my opinion, because of the close proximity in size, makes buying a set like this a little less worth it. That's not to say that they aren't good fry pans. I just feel it better to have diversity in the size and depth of fry pans. I might suggest just finding a good griddle on your own and a different fry pan set but if you can just use more fry pans then you won't do too bad with buying this set."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Krups FME2-14 Not exactly what I expected,"I have had several different coffeemakers over the years, pretty much get a new one every two years. I had the Braun programmable model and was very pleased with it. It was worn looking so we joined the Gevalia coffee club and got their ""free"" one. I was disappointed in its lack of programmable options and when the LCD started going decided to give this Krups a try as it was a couple of dollars cheaper than the new Braun one. Overall it makes a great cup of coffee. Here is my experience so far: while the water fill tube is easy to read, it gets bubbles in it so it does not show accurately. When lit, the LCD is very easy to read. However the LCD does not have much contrast when unlit so is hard to read most of the time. The filter basket is easy to operate - a lever spring-releases it (this seems to be the current trend in all programmable coffeemakers). It is fairly easy to program but don't lose the directions, you will need them if you have to do this again. The automatic on feature is different than any other I have used. It is automatically on all the time. When you prepare your coffee for auto brew, just prepare it. It will come on automatically at the appointed time. If you have not prepared, the coffeemaker will start up, but it will sense that there is no water in the chamber and will power down with an error in the LCD. I am not sure if I like this or not. I think I would rather have to push a button to set the auto-brew. The pot lid is not as easy to remove as others. With others, I have had only to continue lifting the lid gently and the lid has detached. With the Krups I had to twist the lid slightly with more force than I am comfortable imparting to get the lid to release. It was easy to replace the lid - however I am very mechanically inclined. The  coffeemakers overall look is somewhat boxy. While I am not disappointed with the form and function of this unit, I will probably not get another Krups. I think the Braun is a better designed and functioning unit. Finally - I did give this 5 stars, which shows that I think overall it is a very good, top of heap, coffeemaker."

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Makes great brown rice and great steel-cut oatmeal,"I love my new Zojirushi rice cooker! I didn't mind cooking white rice on the oven or quick oatmeal in the microwave, but I really prefer brown rice and steel-cut oatmeal.  The problem was, by the time my wife or I got home to start dinner, it was too late to start on brown rice.  It was the same at breakfast - there just was not enough time to cook steel-cut oatmeal on weekdays, so I only had it on weekends.  I was not willing to pay $100 for a rice cooker, but when I read that it could cook oatmeal as well as brown rice, and it could do it on a timer, and that it could keep rice warm for several hours, I was willing to give it a shot.  If you follow the directions (rinse your rice!), it really does all of those things.  Rice comes out great every time (I have tried several varieties of brown rice), and so does steel-cut oatmeal (I use McCann's).  Rice will stay warm for many hours.  Clean up is a total breeze, particularly if you do it as soon as the bowl cools.  Since I bought it, I have discovered that my 1 and 1/2 year-old loves brown rice and oatmeal, so I have started setting the timer every night so that there is fresh oatmeal waiting for us when we get up.  If you can cough up the $100+, I would highly recommend this rice cooker. "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Nice food processor for your basic needs at a great price,"I bought this about 3 months ago for my mom, and so far we haven't had any problems.  Overall, I am satisfied with the product.  We use it to puree, knead and grind things.  The large capacity bowl is just the perfect size.  I haven't used the slicing blade yet, but I guess the chill lid is useful to collect the sliced stuff outside.  The mouth is a bit small unless you don't mind cutting up things to feed through the mouth.  If it were up to me, I would change the design and make it less bulky and easier to store. I like the big mouth food processors that don't have the control on the side, taking up less space.  But for $25, this is a pretty good one and functions quite well.  If you buy it, make sure the bowl and the lid are well ""locked"" in place before you power on the unit, otherwise it won't run"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Cuisinart Grind and Brew,"I absolutely love the grind and brew.  We are so spoiled by having the super fresh coffee every day! I find the price is fine as these coffee makers were ridiculously high priced a few years ago.  Getting replacement parts is easy.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"nothing fancy, but it's durable","My roommates and I had purchased some basic IKEA dishes (don't remember exactly which type they were) and within the first week of using them at least 3-4 of the dishes chipped from minor falls (ie, they fell into the sink, or from somebody's hands into the dishdrain).  I had grown up with corelle, and knew that we had the same set of dishes for years, didn't treat them with any particular care, and yet very few had chips and seemed to only break when they were both very old and faced a major catastrophe.  So, I decided to make a little investment in dishes(corelle is slightly more expensive, maybe about a half again more, but when you think of the fact that the other dishes were cracking within a week, it'll likely be worth it). One of my roommates thought they looked too flimsy to hold up, especially compared to the hefty IKEA dishes, but it's been months and still no chips in the Corelle. The same roommate that made fun of how thin the Corelle was finally agreed with me when somebody accidentally knocked one off of the table and the bowl was fine. "

This machine has managed to clean every spill, spot and stain on my carpet.  We have two dogs and one of them had a very large, messy and liquid accident on the carpet.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This product truly works!,"I am ever the skeptic when it comes to products with so many different perspective from other reviewers but I had no choice but to purchase this.  My wife has had a constant nasal drip/allergy problem for the last 5 years which she is unwilling to see a doctor for.  It has kept her and I up many a night and she goes to bed feeling miserable most nights.  Oddly enough this only happens in our bedroom (where our two cats hang out all day and night).  We plugged this in last night and although it had a distinct odor (not unpleasant but distinct), we both woke up this morning and she and I could breathe comfortably.  This has not happened for her in years.  Yes there is a noise that comes from the fan on this but it is no louder than a room fan, which I used to have on most nights anyways.  The noise from the fan portion of this was not a problem for us, even on the highest setting.  Essentially this looks and works like a room fan with a built in air purifier (it oscillates too).  I highly recommend this"

kitchen & housewares,0 of 14,2.0,I WANT TO SEE THE SHAPES OF ALL THE SETTING!!!! ,"I am in the market for Onedia Flatware, which I can use for everyday use, but not plain, ugly, but with a character, which we saw at Foley's. I would like to see the shape of not only the fork and knife, but also the spoons and salad forks, as well! I have several older Oneida pieces, which have beauty, grace and also have a lovely shape to the spoons, but which are not overly large or rounded, and fit easily into the mouth, as they are not huge, but rather, are tapered towards the end of the spoons with the soup spoons which are more rounded. This may seem silly to some, but many people DO HAVE problems, with TMJ,Arthritis, plus a lot of other conditions, which make it more difficult to use the very large, rounded spoons, which are very uncomfortable to one who has had three TMJ surgeries as I have. I know this is not important to everyone, but I think it is a good thing to have lovely everday flat ware, simply because it is USED EVERYDAY!Please consider showing the entire FIVE PIECES, so we can not only see what the dinner fork and  knife, look, but the rest of the place setting, also inlcuding the spoons and the tines on the salad fork. I imagine, I am not the only person who would appreciate this. Less expensive does not necessarily mean we want UGLY, but simply cannot afford or do not like ""clunky"" looking table ware and still consider the look of beauty in our everyday table setting. If we are going to buy from online, Please consider this for a lot of people, which I am sure are mostly women, who want something afforable, but also which does not LOOK CHEAP! I have found, I am able to buy for less and do not have to sacrifice the look I want, just because it is not a 100.00 for a five piece setting! Just a suggestion, which would be appreciated very much by me and I think by others, who perhaps have a condition which lends itself to the shape of flatware, but just never say anything about it and make do, with what they can afford! Thank You for the consideration, anyway. Janis from Texas     "

kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,My favorite set of measuring spoons.,"Why do I like these so much?  Because the other two sets of measuring spoons I currently own are too shallow to hold liquid. The Amco spoons are a lot deeper than your average measuring spoon, so I find it a lot easier to use when having to measure out liquids when I'm cooking.   They also seem to be a lot more sturdier.

In all honesty, we are not even going to try it out, so I don't know how well it works.

It's loud enough so that I can hear it anywhere in my apartment, though my apartment is pretty small. The best part, though, is that it has a magnetic backing so that you can stick it to your fridge (and it really sticks well) and press the buttons with it still on the fridge.

It has cut my tortilla making time by more than half and I'm not exhausted anymore. I also used their recipe calling for ""unbleached flour"". I always used regular flour and had a dough that was very elastic and wanted to shrink when rolling. Using ""unbleached flour"" has eliminated the shrinking.

Good cutlery lasts a lifetime and enhances the cooking experience more than any other essential. This 4-Star hones to razor sharp and holds the edge. Good heft, good feel. Comfortable and effortless to use. You could pay more, but I would question why"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,there was nothing lower than 1 star,"the stainless stand, which looks sturdy, shiny and nice in the photo, is flimsy and cheap. in fact, it downright wobbles under the weight of the glass dome so you have to pray that dessert doesn't slip off every time you lift the dome or worse that the glass dome doesn't slide off.  very disappointed at such awful quality -- the stand almost dented when i tried to adjust it to stop the wobbling. do not buy unless you like wobbly platters and potential dinner mishaps, like, dessert on the floor. initially i thought i would keep the dome which i like but 34 bucks is too much to pay for just a glass dome.  i am sending this ugly and useless baby back. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Beautiful eating!,"I love the Fiesta rimmed soup bowls-they hold cassaroles, stews and salads for easy eating.  The new scarlet is a beautiful addition to our set.  The color is clear and bright and makes me want to get out the Valentines"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,5.0,What's not to like?,"It's small, it's cheap, it sharpens knives simply and effectively"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Amazing!,"This was my first major knife ""investment"" and I was a little intimidated by the price tag. It's absolutely worth it though. I had no idea a great knife could make prep work SO MUCH easier"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"Wow, I just had the nicest piece of tofu...","There are too many great things to say about this little device: It's affordable to anybody, even if you are a student stuck living at school. It's compact, you can store it anywhere--a closet, your car, your office, the kitchen cabinet. It's powerful--I have plugged it in and in just minutes began working on an entire three course meal for six people with only this unit to work with. It's easy to clean--this is one of the few products out there that is every bit as easy to clean as the commercials show it to be on TV. It's is economical, using very little electricity to do a just that would waste electricity in a conventional oven or even an older model microwave oven. It's versatile--I have cooked everything from thin pieces of tempeh strips to thick steaks and it cooks both to perfection. You never would have been able to convince me to buy anything on TV before (and most certainly not from a former boxing champion...) but since a friend both this grill for me I have thanked them time and again (and in turn bought the same gift for many a friend of my own)"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,color me a little disappointed,The quality of the china is very good. The weight and feel of the product is substantial. I was disappointed in the color and antique look to them. From the pictures I thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive. They almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,Nice but....,"I have two of these brushes,they are very comfortable &amp; easy to use.I havent had any problems with the handle but i have had problems with the bristles. I always have to check &amp; recheck that i have gotten all the bristles that have fallen out.I have baked a cake &amp; decorated it only to find bristels in it.Although i know what they are ,if their not found in the pan before putting your batter in, someone could think it was a hair.A really thick hair but you wouldnt want someone to find one in your cooking"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great can opener,This can opener is easy to snap onto the can and the handle is easy to turn.  It's the best one I've ever owned so I have to give it 5 stars
kitchen & housewares,39 of 43,5.0,Omega 8002,"This is my 1st juicer.  I feel it is very easy to clean &amp; re-assemble, 5 min max, not a lot of parts.  You can get a lot of juice, a good 8 oz cup from a large apple if it is fresh &amp; juicy.  If it is not real fresh &amp; is mealy dont bother juicing, you will hardly get any and the juice will have pulp in it &amp; it will cause juicer to back up. Also juices spinach, carotts, kiwi &amp; grapes well"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,A Worthwhile Purchase,This product lived up to both its description and my expectations.  The only mistake I made was not buying more than one pair
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,My most used stove top utensil!,"How did I ever live with out this thing? I use it for most every dry-cooking task. My fave: flour tortilia pizza-dilia. Always on hand in my house: Flour Tortilias, jarred tomato pasta sauce and cheese...plus anything in the fridge. Olives, peppers, sausage, turkey pepperoni, frozen spinach, you name it. Preheat griddle, throw tortilia on, spread sauce on top then cheese and any thing else. I pre-cook onions and bell peppers in microwave to soften (i use to saute, but we're talking desperation dinner here) I run it under the broiler to brown off and voila! PIZZA-DILIA! Above all, it's quick and I'm pretty sure it's better for you and know it's quicker than delivery"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Blender,"After buying cheaper blenders and having them wear out within a year or two, I decided that it was time to indulge myself in a top of the line blender to see how it would do. So far, it is by far the best blender that I have ever owned.It make great magaritas."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,"Unbeatable value, if you get it on sale","I purchased this set roughly four years ago, possibly longer, and it still looks relatively new.  I think they'll last as long as I want them around.  They're feather light and the nonstick still performs flawlessly.  The thermospot seems a gimmick, I don't need a spot to tell me when the pan is hot, but it does work, which is admittedly cool.  The light weight of these pans make cleanup a snap, and heat spreads quickly and evenly."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great utensil,"This is really good for bars and brownies, or smaller serving ideas.  For a larger one, I recommend the lasagna turner.  This doesn't stain, has a nice large handle, and cleans really easily.  I love it"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,1.0,Rusted out,"Although a pretty kettle, and with a wide enough base to support a full flame on commercial range such as Viking or Wolf, the inside became pitted and rusted within months. When I inquired from LeCreuset, they explained that it was not an isolated incident, but rather that they had been having problems with the vendor that produced this particular item. Unless you are looking for a disposable teapot you will have to replace within 6 months, stay away from this on"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Perfect for a variety of things.,"Truly non-stick, easy clean ANYTHING. And we have cooked, grilled and done a wide variety of things. You place it over two of the burners and cook on this larger surface or just turn one burner on. After thousands of uses still look like new. We like the groves around the edge to let the fat to run away from the food"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,4.0,Totally Teapot!,"This teapot is the perfect size for those who make tea often and need arge amounts of water. Very stylish, too--adds a nice dimension to the kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Beautiful,These are just the balloon wine glasses I have been looking for.  The shape of the bowl is very attractive and the delicate crystal sings when you (gently) clink with a toast.  The stem is long and elegant and completes the wonderful look of the set. Cheers
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Great Pan!!,I love all Nordicware products.  Their pans are very heavyweight and will last forever.  The only thing you must remember when using them is to grease them well.  I grease mine with shortening and use a pastry brush to &quot;paint&quot; it on.  Doing that I've never had any problems with sticking.  Everything comes out beautifully and looks almost to pretty to eat.  You will not be disappointed in this pan or any others by Nordicware
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,100% Satisfied,"I oredered two sets of these.  They arrived today without breaking during shipping and without any pattern defects. I hope these last as long as my mom's corelle dishes that she's had for almost three decades!  (Regarding thickness, they seem to be the same as my mom's, but don't quote me on that"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Exceptional,"I bought 12 place settings of this pattern and I am very satisfied with it.  I thought it would be a little heavier, but overall I really enjoy it.  It is well balanced, if you put the utensils on a plate as you serve it, it does not flip off.  I have been using it as a replacement another Oneida pattern that I could not obtain replacements for at a reasonable price.  I like it as well as the last pattern.  Oneida, on the whole turns out quality products.  I am confident that it will look good as new for years to come. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Salton Yogurt Maker,It works well and it's easy to store and clean. I just wish it had a timer for automatic shut off. The instuction manual is not that detailed either but this product can't be found in other brands like Cuisinart which I am very loyal to. I only used it once since I bought it but it had great results. The recipe for basic plain yogurt calls for an unnecessary ingrediant - dry milk. I didn't use it and I used less yogurt culture (just a third of what was recommended) yet the result was perfect
kitchen & housewares,14 of 24,1.0,A good workman needs tools that work...,This is in response to another reviewer who blames the people and not the Villa Pasta maker for the substandard product it makes and the horrible quality of the machine. All I can say to this person is that they'd probably be happy with with a brand new car without tires.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Hot tasty meals - FAST!,"I just couldn't resist this purchase when it showed up in my gold box, especially at the price."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Great cookwear, but not perfect","I received the 2 1/2 quart saucepan for Christmas.  Cooks GREAT and cleanup is VERY easy.   A couple of minor annoyances:  1) I wish it came with a glass lid like the Calphalone One nonstick version, and 2) the metal is definitely ""softer"" than my old faberware stainless steel set.   If you bang a spoon against the lip of the pan while cooking(say, to dislodge some rice), it leaves little dings around the edge.  There's still an adequate seal with the lid, but I at this price I expect my cookware to be bulletproof.  Never had this happen on my cheapo Faberware set"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Great for everything!,"This is one of the best knives we own.  Great for slicing fruit, veggies, and meat in small or medium projects.  Very sharp and the pointed end gets used often to pierce fruit for slicing.  Still love my Henkel chef's knives 6&quot; and 8&quot; for chopping, but this is a good companion"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,An excellent machine for the money,"Honestly, the best cappacccino comes from our home now that we have the Krups Novo 3000. It consistantly makes great espresso and although the frothing unit takes a minute or so to get the job done, it froths well enough. If you are BIG into froth, then this is not the unit for you. You may wish to buy a seperate frother instead. The espresso however, is excellent. We found that the Illy brand makes the best espresso."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,WOW!,"My sister bought one of these the last time she was in San Diego at Williams/Sonoma.  She ranted and raved about how great it was till I was practically FORCED to buy one!  It's a winner!  The zest stays on the slightly scooped, concave back, the blades are ultra sharp AND you don't leave 1/2 the zest on the blades as in an ordinary grater.  It's even better than my individual zesters and I thought they were wonderful!  It was odd, while watching the food tv channel last Sat., the hostess of &quot;Barefoot Contessa&quot; was using one of the Microplanes, the long, thin one shaped like a hasp and she commented on what a terrific tool it was.  I have to agree!  IT'S GRRRRR-ATE F/GRATING"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Poor Customer Service Makes This Sealer Useless,"We recommended a Rival food sealer to many friends and relatives, before it developed a glitch. After a short time, the sealer started turning off before the food saver bags were fully suctioned. It was necessary to unplug it and plug it back in to get it going again. As time went on, the problem became worse and worse. After receiving no replies to our contacts to Rival (2 to the 800 number and 1 via email), we tossed it and replaced it with another, more expensive brand. Rival's customer service is non-existent, so do not take a chance with buying any of their products. If it should break, you are on your own."
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Gives Dualit A Run for the Money,"This is a product designed to compete with the gold standard of toasters - the Dualit, which sells for three times the price.  The cast metal design is very attractive and looks as substantial as the Dualit.  I'm not sure if it will last into the 22nd century like the Dualit, but who cares?  It toasts toast as well as any toaster I've ever owned and looks pretty on my counter.  There's a three year warranty,too, which is more than most other brands.  I'm happy with this purchase"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Mixer and Cause.,"This is a replacement mixer for my wife and she loves it, not to mention the great cause receiving the $50.00 Donation. We have the Big Red stand mixer also but this is special and, of course, when you say ""Kitchen Aid"", you've said it all concerning kitchen appliances. Go get one for yourself and ""enjoy"" a great mixer. It does everything that anyone could expect from a stand mixer AND you donate to the National Cancer Society. What more could one expect?! This program just may deserve SIX stars. Enjoy yours"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Almost 5 stars ,"I have a very good set of cookware, however- the lids all have vents. I have one pot that I use when I cook rice (of course, you can't cook rice with a vented lid), but the lid is not tight at all & I end up placing an inverted bowl on the lid to try to push it on a little tighter. Plus I add a little extra water. I got this little pot for just a little over $8 (gold box special) with intentions of using it to cook rice in it. Tonight I used it for the 1st time. While the lid does fit tighter than the other pot I was using, it is still just a tad loose, therefore a little tiny bit of steam does escape. However, my rice came out perfect. The pot has a nice weight to it & I will continue to use it for cooking rice. Some people noted that the handles get hot. Yes, they do, but I don't have a problem using a potholder on the handles. Also, the pot is cute as a button. I like the little knob side handles insead of 1 long handle. The price is right. I would have given it 5 stars if the lid fit a little tighter."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,You won't be disappointed ,"Bought this based on the recomendation of Good Eats. I use AB's basic waffle recipe and adjust the proportions of white and wheat flour to suit my taste that day. The temperature control works best set at 7, except when I make cornbread waffles which come out best set at 5. I initially used non stick spray but found in unnecessary with butter in the recipe. The deep texture of the waffles make them great for holding on to whatever you choose to top them."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,Godsend for a pasta-loving diabetic.,"When I was diagnosed, I was heartbroken, as my two favorite ethnic foods are Italian and Chinese.  For someone who feels like that to be told that he can't eat pasta or rice any more. . .!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 27,5.0,just as pictured,"arrived within a few days, item was exactly as pictured. great price"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Much better than the average funnel,"I bought this funnel set as ""filler"" to get free shipping on an order, so my expectations weren't all that high.  However, they're really great funnels!  Very durable and they seat well into even weirdly shaped openings and stay upright.  Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,A quick and easy cup,"I purchased this machine b/c I am the only coffee drinker in the family and hated the stress and mess of a traditional coffee maker. It didn't hurt that Amazon had the black machine for $22.99 at the time either.  My machine didn't come with pods as described so Amazon even refunded me 20% of the purchase price.  I tried the Millstone pods first. They were strong and bitter IMO. Next I tried the Senseo, which were OK.  Before ordering pods online, I discovered that my Melitta model had a smaller pod holder than the current model.  I found out that I could call Melitta at 1-888-Melitta for a free larger pod holder. I then ordered some pods from Baronet. Wow, these are tasty pods. So far I have tried the Butter Pecan, Pumpkin Pie and Coconut Creme pods. They all fit great in my larger pod holder and taste even better. I am not a coffee snob to say the least, but for a daily coffee drinker, I can recommend this machine without hesitation."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Works well but Still a bit noisy,"Best to use the AC plug as opposed to batteries, unless you enjoy changing batteries often (batteries are beneath the tray and it gets pretty nasty under there).  It does work better than any other smokeless ashtray I've tried, but it's still too noisy for my liking.  Could be there isn't really any way to get it quieter as well as the vacuum does suck up the smoke quite well"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Great knives, great quality, great price","I bought this set under $[...]on a Friday sale and by the next Tuesday it had shot back up to $[...]and was out of stock.  These knives are absolutely amazing especially for the price.  I have used plenty of high quality ridiculously expensive knives, and granted, these aren't AS good, but they're pretty darn close.  The knives are very heavy and the wood block is worth the price of the set by itself.  You will not find knives of this quality and variety anywhere for under $200.  Even if you don't need new knives, buy this set when it comes back in stock, you won't regret it."
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,2.0,Hoover detergents are much better,"Bissell detergents are fine, nothing special.  Works ok at best.  Seems to leave a residue, carpet is not particularly soft, smell is ok, not bad.  Hoover detergent works much better for both my nylon and olefen carptet"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,We all SCREAM for ice cream.,"Turn on the 4080 Lussino. Then add heavy cream, milk, sugar and vanilla. Thirty seconds later you have the best tasting ice cream"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,What's not to like,"Some have said these rust.  I run mine through the dishwasher (have for almost a year) and have never had a single spot of rust on them.  Maybe they reformulated their metal sometime, don't know."
kitchen & housewares,24 of 24,1.0,Laguiole? La Return!,"For appreciaters of fine wine and cooking, the name Laguiole is legendary.  Go to the finest restaurants in Paris and order a bottle of good wine.  Chances are the waiter will use a handmade corkscrew made in the village of Laguiole to open it.  However, fame has bred commercialization and dilution of this famed locale.  This set from Sabatier is a major disappointment.  I certainly did not expect the same quality as a hundred dollar bone corkscrew from the village, but the quality of the metal casting is abominable.  The corkscrew does not retract!  And you are expected to just screw and pull!  The bottle opener does not open some caps!  You are better off with a plastic Screwpull than this set.  Sabatier should be embarrassed"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect Coffee Maker,"I've had every different drip coffee maker under the sun, and they all fell short of my expectations in one way or the other.  I finally decided to splurge on this model, and I couldn't be happier.  My experience--unlike that of a previous reviewer--has been that it can make VERY strong coffee if so desired.  I paired this with the Pro Line coffee grinder, and on a factory setting of 5.5, this makes as strong a coffee as I can imagine wanting.  Also, it's dead simple to operate, makes a full 12 cup pot in under 10 minutes, and thanks to the design, cleanup is a breeze.  I couldn't be happier.  Oh, and it's built like a tank, so it will probably outlast me"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,New ones are sturdier,"  I agree with the other reviewers that this carafe had been overly fragile--mine cracked despite my being very careful--but I just ordered a replacement one and it's thicker and heavier. Apparently, Braun has heard our complaints"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,Primo Turkey Cooker,This pan is a great size for a 20lb bird.  Solid MC2 construction and it's made in the USA.  Item description does not state it but the interior of the pan is nonstick and not stainless.  Good if you are a nonstick fan or not so good if you have reservations about using nonstick
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,5.0,My favorite pan!,That says it all. This is the most versatile pan in my kitchen. It cooks and cleans up beautifully. I use it almost every day
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best Knife Ever!,"This is the perfect knife.  I have many, many other knives of various brands including Cutco, and I always find myself reaching for this one.  Well worth the price!  I always throw mine in the dishwasher and after several years, still no sign of rust"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,why i dont heed the reviews  ,if i listen to some of these reviews i would never have bought this tea kettle but i did and its great
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect Match,"I bought these cases in hopes they would match a sheet set I had and they were a perfect match, love them"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,It does it's job,"Nothing fancy, just mashin' action. I would give it 5 stars if the handle was a bit more comfortable (just hard plastic as opposed to something more comfortable, but it's not like you use it that much) and if the design was closer to the honeycomb open-hole idea instead of the curvy wires, which leave more lumps in your mashed potatoes. But really, if you want perfectly lump-free mashed potatoes, you should be using a ricer, not a masher"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Does it all!,"Love this pan!  Heavy but with the helper handle it's super easy to lift.  Requires little to no oil to saute foods.  Is especially great for re-heating french fries.  No oil, just have the pan on medium-high heat and stir for a few minutes.  No muss or fuss and much less hassle than heating the toaster oven or broiler and not limp like in the microwave.  Have cooked many different foods in this pan and have always been pleased with it.  Clean-up is a breeze.  Just wipe out with paper toweling then run a soapy dishcloth all around.  Rinse and dry. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Too Delicate,"Lovely and a great concept but FAR too fragile to be practical.  This is an ICED tea glass which implies that ice is in the drink, but unless you ever-so-cautiously place each cube into the glass, the inside lining will crack.  I've been afraid to take the last sip or two of a drink because if the ice slides to the top for that sip, it will also slide back to the bottom with unfortunate results.  Bodum has replaced two of the four sets that I purchased, but I will not buy any more"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,A great product for this price,"I bought this to go with a Wamsutta duvet cover in Lotus to match.  Sure the sheets are a little thin, but with a blanket on top, who notices?  For under $10, I don't know what everyone's complaining about.  It's very soft and cozy, and exactly what I was expecting.  Great product"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,great for smoothies,"This thing will make great smoothies - exactly one cup :)  We ordered it for making our own baby food, but now we always throw some frozen berries with yoghurt in.  Easy to clean"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,2.0,Overpriced and weak handle,I was disappointed at how weak the handle was considering how beefy it looks in the picture.  The problem is that the flat metal piece of meatal between the thick handle and ring is just too thin.  Straining a full load would cause the whole basket to sag to the point where I thought the spot weld were going to break.  My old plastic handle strainer deflected less than this metal one.  You can see why I would be disappointed considering this is an expensive strainer.  
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best pan I own,This pan is amazing.  It takes a bit longer to heat up but NOTHING sticks to the surface.  I use it every day....wipe it out or wash it and use it again.  Worth every penny you spend on it
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,4.0,stir fry,this pan does very good making stir-fries and fried rice.  heats fast and stays at temp.  good for deep frying small batches of food(egg rolls). very easy and quick clean up
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,don't buy black towels,"These black towels are awful.  I've washed them 4 times and every time I use them to dry off, black fuzz gets all over me.  Definately won't buy them again"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Cooking is a pleasure......,"This is my second Le Creuset item.  I like the fact that I can use lower heat to cook and it seems to spread the heat so evenly. The weight of this particular item makes it sit firm on my electric burner...a bit of safety factor, to me; and it goes through the dishwasher very well."
kitchen & housewares,21 of 21,5.0,Another great addition!,"Slowly but surely, I'm accumulating all the pieces to my Tri-Ply collection.  This pot has some redundancy, as it's very similar to my 3-1/2-Quart Saucepan, but the main difference is that the sides are a bit sloped.  Thus, I can use it for other applications, such as stir-frying and casseroles.  Moreover, this size is a very handy size to have. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,Leaks!,"I am in total agreement with the previous reviewer and would like to add that this thing LEAKS.  It might have something to do with the fact that the top lid doesn't really fit correctly, but every single time I pour from this pitcher water gets everywhere.  Just awful"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"very pretty set, nice large bowls and cups","I bought this set a few years ago..it came at the time with a bonus set of glasses.  I truly love this set of dishes !  I hvae not had one chip in a dish and we use them on a daily basis...and are known to be tough on dishes !  I love the cherry pattern, and the cups are nicely sized.  Bowls will hold enough cereal to satisfy a teen boy.  My only issue is the plates are a tad big, so they might not fit well in the bottom rack of a dishwasher.  I had to wash these by hand in our old house, but the new house has no problem with the bottom rack."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 8,1.0,CREMA ON THE BOX,"Do not remove the box from the counter. The only creama you will see is the one on the box. About taste of coffee - it smells as something just burned. Attached CD shows how to make Cappuccino, not Espresso. So much of seeing evidence of making a good Espresso."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best towels we ever purchased!!,"Absolutely no complaints---wash beautifully, no lint, no threads"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Easy, even for clumsy thumbed people! ","I am not a great cook.  I love to cook - but I was intimidated reading some of the other reviews, so although I really wanted the machine, I wasn't sure how it would all turn out.  Well, don't be afraid!  Its pretty easy.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Food Saver Rolls,"I like to save money by buying in bulk and portioning out foods for each meal.  It cuts down on defrosting time of chicken, fish, steak, hamburger, etc., by wrapping individually instead of in one big lump. My 4 yr. old Tilia Food Saver is still working fantastic at keeping freezer burn off my frozen meats and fish. I'm thinking about upgrading to a newer Tilia but just can't discard a perfectly good machine yet. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Super Froth,"After spending months looking for a froth maker to go with my coffee, I ordered the Froth N Sauce, This was the best purchase i have ever made. Not only was the price right, but the froth is better then starbucks. Me and my Wife make froth every morning and it would not be the same without our Frith N Sauce. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple and good tasting froth with thier mornings"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Corelle Abundance Set,I am very pleased with this product and would buy more of the same product again
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Great convenience and good but not perfect espresso,"We finally took the plunge and bought yet another complicated piece of machinery to share our house with.  Why a superautomatica?  Making espresso requires a lot of fiddling---even with a simple Italian-style moka machine (if you call that espresso).  When one, like us, is constantly running around with a long list of high-priority tasks in mind, the desire to eliminate any avoidable fiddling is strong and legitimate."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Multiple cat owner loves them,"The Privacy Tent is a must have IMHO.  I just ordered my fifth one.  The cats are very comfortable using them, they keep the litter mass off the floor, the litter box out of sight, and are easy to clean.  I had absolutely no difficulty putting them together - a simple matter of inserting the support poles in FIRMLY and the tent fits just fine.  My cats get on top of them sometimes, but none are broken."
kitchen & housewares,21 of 21,5.0,Powder your chocolate,"I was a little dubious when I first saw the Microplane ""The Better"" Box Grater. It's a box-style grater with two grating sides, one coarse-grained and one fine-grained. It has a mandoline-style acrylic slider that you fit into a track on either side, with a door that you hold against the food you're grating. My past experiences with anything mandoline-styled have been poor. In this case, however, that experience did not hold true."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Pizza Peel for the Novice,"I bought this paddle as a gift, and it's great for those looking for something simple, lightweight, and affordable for home use. It's good for bread as well, not just pizza. Also convenient to store because you can simply hang it on a hook, and not have to worry about shelf or cupboard space. I'm really happy with this product, and especially it's affordability!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Super sharp and well balanced,I debated this purchase for a while and am very glad to have purchased these well balanced knives
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,The Best Food Storage Set,"I love my set and the containers and lids have been very durable.  There are a couple of great features I would like to point out:  the containers come out of the dishwasher without a ""film"" like most plastics do.  In other words, they rinse clean.  The plastic also does not hold onto food smell like other storage containers.  And, true to its name, tomato sauce and other foods do not stain.  A great, innovative product"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Amazon didn't lie,"The manufacturer's package clearly stated ""Churchill China Chelsea Blue Willow"".  Inside, true enough, was Wessex, made in Malaysia - but this was a mislabeling on the part of Churchill China.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great Mattress Pad at a Great Price!,"I think this is a very nice mattress pad and will definitely last the test of time.  Watch though... it only fits up to 15"" mattresses, unlike the 17"" stated in the description.  It even says  15"" on the packaging.  The sides are great and super stretchy, and it really stays put.  I had cheap ones before that would pop off all the time and didn't hold up in the wash.  I think this is a great mattress pad at a really excellent price"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Fresh coffee all the time!!!!!!!!,"I really love this coffee maker. No more wasted coffee, no more coffee grinds to clean up, and you get fresh coffee all of the time! I completely recommend it for people who have one or two cups of coffee a day. If you like more than that, however, you may find the old way to be a better fit. I'm keeping my old machine for large get togethers, but I like the frothy cup that the Senseo makes so much, it might still be my machine of choice for my guests, as well."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very Sharp,"Cut My finger the first time I used it.. Very good on tomato slicing and even better to slice onions paper thin,, Just watch your fingers"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Good Enough.,"Stay away if this is your only mixer.  Just not strong enough for certain jobs.  But as the proud owner of a heavy stand mixer, I find this does just fine for the light jobs.  In fact I use it more than the stand mixer.  And the price is unbeatable"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Soft but wrinkle easily,These sheets are very nice and soft. The only problem I had with them was that they wrinkle too easy and I don't have the time or patience to iron sheets.
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,2.0,This product is not worth anything!!,Its made of plastic which is not poerful. It spills the drink you are trying to make and is really messy. It dusnt blend much at all and takes a lot of effort to clean.
kitchen & housewares,11 of 14,5.0,"Wow, what a machine!!!","We had one of these babies in my apartment at college and we used it for everything.  Put any good food into the cuisinart and it comes out even better than before.  Imagine, chipped roast beef sandwiches, fruit smoothies, home made salsa, hummis, just about anything.  If the Cuisinart could withstand college apartment use, it can withstand anything!!  Wow, Cuisinart is the God of the kitchen!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Design meets function,I love this Electric Kettle. I don't like stovetop kettles because if you get distracted your water boils away and it ruins the kettle.  The easy solution would seem to be to get a kettle that whistles but with small children I decided to forgo this option because I usually make tea when my toddler is napping and a whistle would ruin this time alone.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best Everyday Cooker I've Ever Had,"I have this model.  It is so much more than a slow cooker, but slow it can be!  I've purchased Rival products before this one and every thing in a Rival BOILS, even at low setting.  This is truly slow and I have not experienced ""hot"" spots or over-cooking as other reviewers have."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Fast Extracting Easy Cleaning Machine,"We had the Jack Lalane juicer prior to this one and since we purchased the Breville, we have not been dissapointed & its been 2 months of activity, my wife juices about 10-12 times per week and so far so good.  Its a lot faster and extracts better.  To clean is an ease and easy to assemble & dissamble.  I actually paid more for the Jack Lalane juicer by $35 yet the Breville is worth it especially when the cost and shipping were all about $90. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Ron In Denver,"I've used this pan 3 times so far.  It works great, minimal sticking, easy to clean"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent value!,Excellent value. Handle folds for easy dishwasher clean up.  Stain resistant stainless steel should last for years
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Purchase!,"I've bought very expensive pot and pans in the past, and this set out does them all.  The price is right, they are light weight, excellent quality, and still provide even cooking.  My husband is a gourmet cook and loves the set.  GREAT PURCHASE"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,nice indoor grill,I've only used mine twice but so far it has worked really well. It is a little hard to clean but I found that using a clean toothbrush (now kept by the kitchen sink) you can clean the crevices pretty easily. I cooked sugared sirlions on it tonight and the sugar was baked on. It cleaned up with little effort in hot water using the toothbrush. Can't beat the price and I love cooking from my 30 minute meals cookbooks which have all kinds of grilling recipes
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,KitchenAid Blender,"I was extremely pleased with this product, as I am with all KitchenAid products.  I especially like the base - the way it operates.  Do not have to watch how I attach it to the blender itself.  Everything goes in the dishwasher too. "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,very pleased,"I ordered this mattress pad for my daughter's bed. When I opened it,I was very pleased. It is very soft! I've looked around at different stores comparing prices and this was the best price for this quality mattress pad."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,"great service, great dishes","I placed 2 different orders for a total of 55 place settings of fiestaware, spread across 10 different colors.  The dishes look great. Everything arrived quickly without any hassles &amp; nothing was broken.  People who expect to match color off pictures from the web aren't doing their homework.  Check colors at local stores &amp; you'll know exactly what you'll be getting. There are also a lot of websites with more pictures and detailed color descriptions"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Delighted,I've just recieved this set and I am so delighted with it that I am buying a second. I did a lot of comparison shopping and not only is this a great product but Amazon is offering it at a terrific price
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Bad battery life,"Like others before me, I found that after only a few weeks of light duty, this handvac stops holding a charge beyond a few seconds.  Charge light comes on and there is no indication that the handvac isn't being charged, but it will only work for a few seconds and then turn itself off.  Too bad, too.  Because when it worked, it worked really well, but when it goes bad, you are left with no recourse.  The EuroPro customer service is a joke.  They will take your order, take your money, then never send the item.  They do not back up their products at all.  Buy something else"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,I never knew coffee could taste this good!!!,"I was shopping for a new coffee maker for a gift, and ended up splurging after a salesperson convinced me to pay the extra money for a combination grind/brew machine. I can't believe how happy I am with this coffeemaker! This is the first grinder we have ever used, and the taste compared to store-bought ground coffee flavor is phenomenal. Everything about the coffeemaker makes me glad I bought it"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 13,5.0,Think &quot;out of the box&quot;{,Fill the ramekin with a dip and place in a matching (coordinated) LeCreuset oval casserole dish filled with chips or veggies.  Nice presentation
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Won Over,"For years, nonstick pans were my preference. I had too many bad experiences with horrible cleanup caused by food sticking to a  well-known manufacturer's stainless pans. I am concerned with heart-healthy cooking and this pan requires a minimum amount of oil to prevent foods from sticking. I've had this pan for 6 months and have yet to have any difficulty with clean up. I wanted a heavy enough pan to withstand the heat of my gas stove but was concerned about it being too heavy to lift comfortably. The double handles really help. My favorite feature is the glass ovenproof lid. No more boil-overs while I'm multi-tasking! The price was very reasonable for the such a high quality tool. My prior large pan was a 5 1/2 quart size &amp; never quite big enough. The 6 quart size works for everything. I use this pan as a stock pot, as a dutch oven and as a fryer. I use it so often I never put it away; it lives on my stove. I'm so satisfied I'm getting ready to purchase an Emerilware saucepan to keep my 6 quart stock pot company"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Good Product for Cornbread Lovers,"This pan makes really good cornbread!  Heat it up and grease it before putting in the batter and you'll end up with cornbread that is tender in the middle and has a nice crispy crust.  The small booklet that comes with the set has some recipes that look interesting, but I haven't tried any yet,  Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,Awful,This couldn't even handle chopping a 1/4 of an onion that had already been roughly chopped.  
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Wow! ,"I, too, was hesitant about spending this much $$ to make milkshakes; however, the kids love to make shakes and the standard blender is hard for them to clean (not to mention the sharp blades). After our first use, my 15-year-old son said that he was ""Ecstatic!"". Anyone with teenagers knows how hard it is to achieve an emotional response--normally I get a monosyllabic grunt."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Grandfather Knows Best,"This is a powerful and efficient little machine!  I eagerly pull out this little fan as soon as summer begins, because it easily handles a 15' by 20' room.  It circulates even hot air to the point where it feels comfortably cool. I started with one that was lost during a move, and proceeded to buy three for the new home that's not air-conditioned. And there was something about the name of the product that drew me to it immediately--I finally remembered that my grandfather had Vornado fans throughout our home, and he was a master at efficient home solutions!!!! In my opinion, it is worth purchasing"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Wonderful Product,"I am highly satisfied with this product which allows us to cook dishes in small quantieis for multiple persons at once.  It reminds me of the raclettes we used in Europe, small portions, easy to clean, easy to cook.  Would recommend this product to anyone wanting that kind of dining experience"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love the sled!,"I make muffins weekly for my restricted diet.  The sled keeps the muffins ""compact.""  The price was great--better than anything else I found.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great buy,These are quite nice.  They are made extremely well and come apart easy for cleaning.  I purchased these when I was ordering some other products and needed a little more qualify for a big discount coupon as well as free shipping.  
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Cool Blue Beanbag,"I really like this beanbag because, it's very comfy. When I sit on it, I don't want to get up. LOL. I got this for my six year old son for his room, and he likes to sit on it all the time especially when he's watching TV. I need to get one for myself also. :) Awesome deal for the price at Target"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Awesome cappuccino maker ,"I was given this as a gift a couple of years ago and it worked pretty well, but I was always looking for something a little easier.  I ended up purchasing the Hamilton Beach 40729 Espresso/Cappuccino Maker with Pod Holder.  This was a pretty good machine-easy to use and made decent drinks.  Four months later it broke.  So, I brought out my old Mini-S and can't remember why I ever looked for another product.  This one is easy to use and clean, and the espresso and steamer functions work tons better than the Hamilton Beach.  Yes, if you're going to make 4 shots of espresso, you will have to brew them in 2 different batches and it's true that the steam will only last for a short time.  But the steam that does come out works the first time.  You won't have to run a second batch of water just to finish the job like I did with the Hamilton Beach.  It really is a great user-friendly product."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love my coffee,"The only thing I love as much as my morning coffee is, my coffee mug. I love that my coffee stays warm from the time I first pour it, until the well after carpool"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Excellent ,"This is great for cooking when you don't want to pierce your meat, and for flipping things quickly and easily.  The only thing I'm not completely happy about is that there isn't a whole lot of grip at the end (for teeth or holding on to the food).  It's long enough to use for almost anything, and it cleans easily.  It has a locking handle, so you just pull the black thing at the top, and they automatically lock closed for storage.  Nice thick steel, and overall, a really nice product"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,"Don't buy this, read the reviews first!","I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought this thing.  You can spray a half gallon of no-stick spray in to these egg cups...it is moot.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to clean the egg cups...soak them, spray them, scrape them.  I just tossed the entire thing in the trash and ordered a better made one, with NON STICK egg cups.  Item is JUNK!  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,Great....for awhile,"This sharpener worked great on my Globals for about six months. since then, the rough diamond texture has worn down and I can't get the same edge on the knives. Going to try a Kyocera ceramic sharpening steel"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,I love this!!,"I bought mine from QVC at a slightly lower price, but it didn't come with the bottle stopper, so pretty much the same.  I LOVE it. I have had mine for just over a month and have used it at least twice a day, every day, not just for vacuum sealing, but just closing a regular chip bag or a cereal bag. That alone keeps the food fresher longer. I put fresh fruit in the canister and it stayed fresh so long, I couldn't believe it. It is pretty loud, especially since my kitchen is the size of a shoebox. But it works so well, I don't think that matters. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice egg separator,A nice kitchen tool for separating egg whites and yokes - very attractive too - i keep mine out on the counter
kitchen & housewares,3 of 8,5.0,Le Creuset 7 1/4 Quart French Oven,We love it!  This cookware is THe only thing to buy.  Get rid of anything else
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,What is the hype about?,"I used this thing once and I wish I had never bought it.  It does not ""infuse"" anything and my chicken had to be finished in the microwave.  We much prefer out grill outside to this joke of a cooking item.  It is also huge which makes storing it difficult.  I have given it to a very happy neighbor and just use my gas grill"
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Quality deteriorates very quickly,We bought this machine and initially loved the espresso it produced. Less than 10 uses later it started producing a watery brew that is completely unrecognizable as espresso. 
kitchen & housewares,26 of 27,2.0,"""Best"" food mill not the best","Having decided to get the hightest quality food mill, I bought the cuisipro.  It has two major disadvantages over less expensive models.  The grinding plates are completely smooth, hence there is no ""bite"" when you grind and it takes more effort to push food through.  Secondly, there is no gripping texture on the part that balances on the vessel below.  Hence, the machine slides around and makes cranking more difficult.  The only advantage is large volume"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!","Have had it for about a year now and am still amazed by what it picks up. I can't believe how much dirt a carpet can hold after seeing the full canister. I've owned a few in my time including a Hoover Wind Tunnel (hated it...finally died), Roomba, Electrolux, and even a Eureka Boss Central vac. This is my favorite vacuum and I actually enjoy using it which is unusual for me because I hate vacuuming. With 3 dogs (Including a shedding golden retriever) and 2 longhaired cats you can only imagine the hair that accumulates around here. The Dyson picks it all up. Of course I have to use it on an almost daily basis to keep up with all the pets, but it works. The canister gets filled up every time and is thankfully easy to clean. It's pretty low maintenance without having to keep replacing the bags or filter. Of course do make sure to clean the beater brushes (but that is true of all vacums). If you have shedding pets this is the ONLY vacuum to consider. It's pricey, but definitely worth it"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,great little pitcher,has plenty of room for milk to expand.  easy to clean
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Perfect for the BBQ,"Love these tongs.  The 12&quot; model is much more practical for the kitchen, but this 16&quot; model is absolutely perfect for the barbeque.  There are many brands of tongs, but OXO has the best springiness -- not too strong and not too wimpy.  The only other tongs worth considering are the 12&quot; Hamilton Beach ones that lock or unlock by gravity -- one or the other as you invert them.  The latter are excellent for a cook who cannot use a second hand to move the locking piece at the handle end of the OXOs"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,DON'T ORDER FROM TARGET,I ordered these georgeous blue glasses directly from Target-I ordered other items as well.  I received a box of tiny bits of glass.  The other items in my order were damaged as well.  What's the deal-doesn't Target know how to pack things for shipping?  I am not able to get these in the stores that is the reason I ordered them.  NEVER AGAIN will I mail order from Target
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent Quality Feather Blanket,"This blanket is great, high quality ~ well made feather down blanket.  Of course there is the occassional feather but if you've had a feather blanket its well worth it.  It is warmer than I thought it would be since I was using it for my summer comforter, but personally I think that holds with the quality of the blanket.  I still use it but can wait to snuggle under it in the winter time!  You won't regret buying this one.  Well worth the cost. I love it!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,5.0,Spice rack,What can you say about a spice rack?  The spice bottles fit nicely in it.  It looks great.  It came quickly.  I am a happy woman
kitchen & housewares,12 of 15,5.0,Kithchaid  food processor gets 5 stars,It is so easy to use if you have trouble with you hands. The size is right for everyday use.I have had the other big  brand and find this one is so much better to use
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Finish Flakes within a year,"I too bought these because of the Calphalon name, at Target for $200.  Pass on them.  I babied these pans like crazy because they were so beautiful and I wanted them to last.  Every single one of them went to the trash within 2 years - the skillets within 6 months.  Didn't even cook on high heat, or fry, and the finish goes thru this process:  a) silvery scratches (that is the aluminum underneath), b) finish bubbles up, c) finish flakes right off, into your food.  Extremely dangerous.  Soon your food is mixing up with teflon + aluminum.  I wish these companies would get some ethics and pull these products from the market.  ""non-stick"" is a joke - stainless steel cleans up instantly with vinegar and hot water"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,steel egg separator,makes cooking easy - separates egg whites and yokes nicely - a very useful kitchen tool
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,2.0,Not even the basics,"You get what you pay for.  I was unimpressed with the sizes of the pans.  They are either way to small or way to large.  you either have a pan to cook for one or a pan to cook for 10.  You have to go out and get other pans to suppliment the missing sizes.  Neither non-stck pan is big enought to cook more than one grilled cheese, and bacon has to be cut in half to fit in the frying pan.  I bought two sets (one as a gift) and wish I had known how difficult it was to cook in these pans before i got rid of my old pans. "
kitchen & housewares,21 of 24,1.0,Curls too easily,"Though these claim to be dishwasher safe, i can say that they are not.  After one trip to the dishwasher these have curled so badly that they have become useless.  To use these right now i have to put weights in all four corners of the board, and if i try to pick them up, they snap to curl shape so fast whatever rememnants are on the board fly into the air.  Avoid these"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great all around filter,"The filter is great for most grinds of coffee. I do grind mine a little more fine than most and unfortunately I do wind up with a minor amount of ""mud"" at the bottom of my cup. If you grind your own coffee stick with a more course grind and this filter is excellent"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Excellent for the price,"This is a nice addition to one's stock of kitchen hardware, especially for the price.  The construction is solid, the handle keeps cool, and the pan heats evenly.  If you need a pan of this size, do not hesitate"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Very practical!,"These may not be a cute as the tabletop salt and pepper shakers (the smaller round ones) but let me tell you that having the handles makes a world of difference when it comes to cooking.  You know the moment that I am talking about....your hands are covered in whatever you are making (flour, butter,chicken juice, ect.) or they are already pre-occupied by the spoon, oven-mitt, pot, or pan you might be tending to but you still need a little more salt.  What do you do?  You grab the handle...thats what it's there for, and you need not worry about it slipping out of your hands and onto the floor or into your food"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent for steaming,"I hesitated to buy this because of a few negative reviews. I'm glad I changed my mind.  I bought this a couple of years ago for my mother, who's Mexican-American, to simplify steaming tamales.  She loved it!!!  The lid fits perfectly and the weight on this pot is ideal, with most of the weight on the bottom for proper balance.  Although it is significantly lighter than traditional All-Clad pots it is by no means a flimsy piece.  A reviewer of the 16-quart sister (stock) pot was right-on when he mentioned that one only needs 3-ply on the bottom, not on the sides (for stocks).  We've used it for clambakes too.  Cleaning is a breeze."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Nice pan,"This is a good quality, heavy pan. It cooks evenly and washes up just fine."
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Best little coffeemaker in town,"For the price, this may be the best coffeemaker in the world. It consistently brews a fine cup of coffee and, due to its unique design, the last cup is always as good as the first, since the coffee doesn't continue to cook after it's made. The unit is good looking, if a bit large, and it's the easiest to clean of any I've had. It has only 2 shortcomings: water condensate drips out the back when the lid is raised after the coffee has been made (easy to fix with a strategically placed paper towel); and the heating unit doesn't heat the coffee quite hot enough for me, so I have to nuke my cup for 30 seconds before it's as hot as I like it. Otherwise, it's a fabulous coffee maker--the only one that's better is the model with a timer. Buy it, you'll love it!"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,2.0,"Weird smell, weird taste","As some other reviewers have mentioned, the sheet leaves a chemically taste and smell in your baked products -- it's nothing awful, but noticeable, and, to me, bothersome.  I thought it would fade, but after a few attempts I figured my ""wear-in"" efforts weren't worth all the cookies  ending up in the trash.  The surface of this baking sheet was easy to wipe clean.  However, the grease from the food eventually started soaking into the sheet and leaving circles of grease which I just could not wash out.  At the end of the day, I don't think this is any more convenient or better than using parchment.  This product is overrated."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grill ,"This is the third Delonghi grill I have owned.  The first was very similar to this model in that it had a non-stick surface.  It was great.  I had to replace it after 2-3 years since the power plug in unit broke.  I replaced it with a Delonghi unit that did NOT have a non stick surface. It was impossible to clean.  I returned it for a  store credit and bought the Perfecto from Amazon on-line.  I have used it 2-3 times a week since I got it.  It is easy to use, easy to clean and I am very pleased with the unit. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Spinning Salad,"I enjoy having this. I feel even the bagged salads must now be washed also, especially after the spinich e. coli breakout. I used to buy full leaf lettuce and wash then dry on papertowels individually. This makes it so much easier! I also like to use it for other things like mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and grapes"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,4.0,Waring Professional Convection Oven,"This oven was delivered very quickly - I was surprised.  I like the oven very much and particularly the rotisary.  I have rotisarized about everything you can think of and it is all delicous.  I have trouble baking cookies in it, as the temperature is quite a bit higher than a normal oven and things burn easily.  I am sure practice will make perfect.  I was also surprised at the amount of heat this oven creates.  You must have it in a well ventilated area (open) for safety.  On a countertop under cabinets would not be advisable.  Too much heat!  Other than that I am quite happy with it and would probably order it again."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Spatulas that take the heat,"This is a nice set of spatulas. It's only after you get them that you realize how useful they are. Here are some of the ways I use them, you can see why I like to have many."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Fantastic,"I've used this zester countless times and it's never let me down. It'll breeze through limes, oranges, satsumas, clementines, grapefruits, and stem ginger. If you get a little vigorous you can skin your knuckles or take off too much zest and end up with pith in your Key Lime Pie - but that's the only detraction from what is otherwise a stunning piece of kitchenware design. Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Horgy from MA,"Does an excellent job of cooking whatever you put in it without drying the food out.  Chicken, steaks, fish, shellfish, everything, comes out moist and flavorful.  Gives the appealing appearance of grill lines without the drying effect of the outdoor grille.  I really enjoy cooking with this grill, and often choose recipes based upon being able to use the grill"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,At last...decent Expresso..,"I have had the Pro Line Espresso Maker for a month now and am very impressed, although this seems to be a USA based site and I live in the UK I don't think other than voltage etc there is any differences in the product."
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Hard to handle,"I purchased this set last year and hate using them, because they are so uncomfortable. I really like the style and the fact that they are heavy. When I went to use them I couldn't find a comfortable way to hold them I felt the smaller spoons and forks were a little easier to handle than the larger one"

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,I love my Scooba!,I have had my Scooba for about a month now and love it. It does an awesome job on both my kitchen tile floors and hardwood floors. I am always amazed at how dirty the water gets from cleaning and how much debris it picks up. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,I can read while I wait,"I actually purchased this book light so that I can read while I wait for my child to sleep.  he likes me to be in the room.  This was perfect.  Does not put out enough light to bother my son, but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while I wait for him to fall asleep"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great Cookware!!!,I've been cooking with this cookware for almost 6 months now.  We got the 10 pc set as a wedding gift and I absolutely love it.  It's wonderful!  I just cooked some pork chops last night and they seared beautifully and the deglazing worked wonderfully as well.  You really do get the best of both worlds with this cookware...the searing/deglazing but also the quick release feature so the pans are super easy to clean.  We did have a problem at first with some discoloration of the inside of the pot after steaming vegtables or boiling meat.  It was a white sort of film coating areas of the inside.  It wouldn't be there when it was wet but when it dried you could see the white discoloration.  I got worried but with a little bar keepers friend it cleaned right up.  Awesome!  We've have no problem with these pots and have loved how they peform.  And as a side bonus they are really nice looking pots and pans.  We are planning to get a pot rack soon to display them.  If you have the money you should definitely invest in this cookware.  You won't regret it
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Dazzer saved our relationship!,I have a very actiuve Border Collie and she had a tendency to bark at anything! I tried all the training methods I could find and nothing worked. I then purchased a Citronella spray gadget ($$$) which did nothing. (I think she liked the perfume.) I was contemplating with great reluctance one of those electrical shocking devices ($$$$) but just in time my nephew lent me his Dazzer and within 2 days i have a rarely barking dog. I can't recommend it enough
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Simple beauty.....Great product!  ,"I had been looking for a basic setting that I could dress up or dress down.  This is perfect, and to have the quality of Corelle...needless to say I'm thrilled.  Great quality, simple beauty, fast shipping, everything arrived in tact as they were packed excellently (I ordered three boxes and not one thing was broken!).  I was worried about the swirls being hard to clean but they are not very deep and they rince off easily.  My husband says they are his most favorite plates of all we've had over the years."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Your Lodge will outlive you!,"Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it's indestructable (I'm still using my mother's Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954). This dutch oven goes from the table to the campground with ease. It stews and bakes beautifully - get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis at home! Cast Iron still manages to look dressy on a table and you can tote it from your stove to the church potluck! Also makes a fabulous wedding, shower, or housewarming gift. Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride this Lodge Dutch Oven and  Lodge Cast Iron Skillet. She'll hand them down to the next generation. Also great for those kids who just moved into their first apartment - they'll never destroy THIS piece of cookware no matter what they burn! A must have for EVERY cook"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"An awesome treat, but watch out for waste.","The IC200 ice cream mixer is a one-trick pony. The only thing it's supposed to do is take hard ice cream and convert it into soft-serve, and this is does quite well."

When one our friends got this for us, we were estatic!  I've always had those flimsy roasters that rust and warp after a few uses...not anymore!  This Simply Calphalon roaster is just the upgrade that we were looking for."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I own it- outstanding!,Purchased in 2000- this is the best coffee maker ever. Easy to use and durable. Turns regular Folgers into a Great cup of coffee. Well worth the price
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Get crackin! Get this set!,"When I was putting my bridal registry together, I had asked for this seafood set. I am an OXO fanatic. I just love their products. That said, I was still overwhelmed by how much I would come to love this seafood set! It  works better than I even imagined! You can get out every last piece of  crabmeat, even in the skinniest of crab legs! It must be the pointed edge  and hollowed design, that really allows you to delve down deep, grab on,  and come back up with the prized seafood in tow.  The cracker is also so  well designed, that it can crack through the hardest of shells with ease  while the handle stays comfortable in your hand. This product is OXO doing  what it does best. I highly recommend this set"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Very Happy with this coffee maker,"We bought this Cuisinart coffee maker after reading the reviews of every single thermal carafe/10-12cup coffee maker out there (our previous Krupps had stopped working, and the current Krupps model got bad reviews)."
kitchen & housewares,22 of 22,5.0,Great Gadget!,"I received my cookie press today, and I found it very easy to use. You choose the shape you want the cookies to be in, fill the press with dough, and the press puts out jest the right amount of dough with one click of the leaver. I also enjoy the feature of having a storage container for the disks and attaches to the cookie press, defiantly a nice way of keeping all the peaces together. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't provide any cookie dough recipes for the press, but I was able to find several recipes online fairly easily. All in all I'm very pleased with my purchase. This is one great gadget."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,Truly not worth anything at all.,"My parents purchased this product to make x-mas sprits cookies. We had an electric cookie press before, but it accidentally broke (I ripped the cord out while trying to remove it from our drawer)."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,All-Clad Stainless Steamer Insert - Must Have!,This is a wonderful steamer insert.  It is perfect for steaming veggies and also for steaming dim sum (delicious!) or whatever your heart desires.  It fits perfectly into the 3 and 4 quart saucepans and 3 and 4 quart casseroles.  I primarily use it in my 3 quart saucepan.  I have never had any loss of steam and it is very easy to clean.  I store it right in one of my 3 quart saucepans.  It is made of high quality 18/10 stainless steel and is built to last.  It is a must have for your All Clad collection.  Highly recommended! A+
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,KING OF PERCOLATORS,"I bought this percolator because the coffee ,no matter how expensive the maker was did not taste that good.  I buy my coffee from Hawaii and it lacked something.  I decided to buy a percolator and I love the cuisinart brand and it was a perfect fit, the style is classic , sleek, and easy to clean.  It tastes 100% better than the auto coffee maker, I will not go back.  Thanks Cuisinar"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect!!!!,"These are the cutest salt & pepper shakers ever! I had read that they were way to small and required frequent refills. However, unless you prefer the taste of a salt lick to food or are serving dinner to entire hockey teams, you should be fine. They are actually a little on the large side for a dinner set. But at any rate you can't beat the great mushroom shape and wonderfull colors. A must have for anyone who loves Fiestaware!"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,F-ing Awesome!,"This is my 4th ice crusher and is by far the best for accompanying soft drinks.  This ice crusher looks awesome, automatically feeds ice (you dont have to force the ice into the chute), and the dispensing tray is even large enough to put a small cup inside so you don't have to dig out the ice with your hand or a spoon.  This ice crusher cannot jam like most others and is WELL WORTH the price  as I love this ice crusher.  Note: This is not for snowcones, etc. as it is a ice crusher not a ice shaver"

I have never put them in the dishwasher. They wash quick and easy clean up. If something is stuck on it I just wet a sponge and let it sit on it for a bit and then wipe it up. I have even used the one with the sides all around for pork chops, etc. I love my AIRBAKES!"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Worth every penny. ,"This cookware set is simply wonderful and is a delight to use. The pots and pans are heavy (which I like) and very well-built. The stay-cool handles are an added bonus. I own cookware sets by Calphalon and Lagostina, and I have to say that the Anolon set is my favorite and the set I use everyday. I can't recommend it highly enough."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Nice Set,"I bought these to replace my stainless steel spoons that were mangled by the garbage disposal.  I would have given these 5 stars but I don't like the ring that holds the spoons since the spoons keep falling off and it doesn't include the 1/8 teaspoon.  Other than that, I like them.  They are not as sturdy as my previous set but are a nice addition to my kitchen essentials"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Gizmo is hard to handle,"My Gizmo is extremely hard to position, to get it started cutting.  After 4 or 5 tries, I finally get it started - but it's very frustrating.  Also, since it lacks a handle, it is hard to handle while trying to position it."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Great Price, Great Product!","We just got our DeLonghi Panini Grill about a month ago when we saw this sale. The unit itself is great--very nice looking, not too heavy and can fit sideways in smaller spaces. Although the griddles don't detach, we've had easy clean ups every time.  It doesn't take long to heat up and maintains well. The press-bar is wide and easy to use. Our 14 year old loves it to make his own grillers with this. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sturdy, reliable grill at a bargain price."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,"Excellent item, but.....","I use the tenderizer every time I grill meat.  It really works like a charm.  And you get a li'l work out in too.  The only drawback is cleaning.  I seem to remember reading that it is easy as tossing into dishwasher.  Well, you  will find small pieces of meat stuck between the blades.  Be careful with this since it is raw meat.  It is easily disassenbled to be further cleaned.  Or just use an old toothbrush to dislodge meat.  Oh yeah.  Blades are REALLY sharp.  Be careful.  "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Worked Well,"I develop pound cake recipes and have always used metal pans. I bought this pan on a whim from Target. It works very well. I use a flour-based baking spray and my cakes brown very well and cook evenly, with a full crust. I have used this pan numerous times and each time the cakes received rave reviews. Because of the flexibility of this pan, use care when placing the pan with batter into the oven. I have not had any issues with this pan, but I have been careful. I love it"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,For better or worse?,"Doesn't anyone else get charcoal residue in the bottom of their pitcher?  I do and so does our neighbor.  I've even made sure to run water thru a new filter more than the recommended number of times.  There is still a fine accumulation of charcoal powder in the bottom of the pitcher.  You can write your name in it.  The company admits to it, but there are even floating chunks of charcoal in the top chamber.  Can't they design it so this doesn't happen.  Make you wonder if it's better to drink the water straight from the tap"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,R2D2,"Cute little pudge looks just like the charactor from Star Wars.  I bought a new stove and it gives one little buzz and then stops.  I was burning too many cookies, so I bought the Kitchenaid Timer. After years of plastic junk, I am very happy to have a quality timer.  It is completely enclosed, with no crevices, so you can pick it up with your gunky hands and just wipe it off when you're done.  It has an ingenius way of activating, but as soon as you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  It rings long and loud, which makes me happy"
kitchen & housewares,33 of 49,4.0,easy to use and less of a mess,I prefer a box grater to the flat or hand-held models. They are so much easier to use and create less of a mess if you have limited counter space to work with or are trying to get semi-exact measurments. Plus they are great with kids - my two girls love to help out with the cooking and take their job of cheese grating VERY seriously. It's so much easier to clean up after their 'help' if their work can be isolated to various containers
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic,"Emile Henry bakeware is fantastic and I use it for lots of stuff, not just lasagna.  I ordered this dish as a replacement for one I had for years but I accidentally broke it.  I was so upset when I broke it I ordered this one right then and it came just two days later!  Cleans so easily and looks new after years of use!  No kitchen is complete without this dish"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Worth the $$!  Even heat distribution and fabulous results.,I've made everything from braised short ribs to homemade Mole in this and I can truly say it is fabulous.

kitchen & housewares,0 of 5,4.0,Works great!,Thls wine saver is easy to use and will definitely keep wine for an extended period.  Works considerably better than another product I had tried
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Good value for money,"This cake pan has a duller inside surface than the Silicone Zone bakeware, but it's rated to 500 degrees instead of 428. And cakes do flip out very easily. It also appears to be well constructed. It's flexible yet strong. Though it's a little floppy, so you do have to put a cooking sheet under it to take it out of the oven otherwise you'll break up the cake. The Silicone Zone cake pan feels a little sturdier, but it has the same problem. When I bend this pan, it doesn't show any white, which indicates no fillers were used. Overall I think it's worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,does the job,This coffee maker actually makes a good size 12 cups. It is easy to fill.  The coffee stays nice and hot. Pours easily. What else do you need. The only problem I found was the top does not stay completely closed

","One of my latest favorite, ""cant-do-without,"" kitchen gadgets is this WMF stainless steel Odor-Eater egg-shaped bar. It is easy and safe to use and won't harm delicate skin. Simply rub your hands with the product under warm running tap water, as if using soap, and odors are gone. No real soap is needed. Voila! Like magic! I never heard of this before - the interaction between 18/10 stainless steel and strong smells."

kitchen & housewares,21 of 22,4.0,Best for one person,"I bought it for $10 a few years ago. This is great if you can ""cook"" at work. Just throw a frozen hamberger patty and you have something to eat in 10 mins. But the surface is really small, so you can only cook small quantity at a time. Also cleaning is not as easy as they say. You can't throw it in the dishwasher. The grill outside gets sticky from the greasy fume so in that respect it takes more work to clean. Inside is pretty much wiping off the juice and the residue but I use soapy water and a sponge so I have to do that a few times as well. If you are single, live in a bachelor/studio or stove-less environment like a student, this is a great addition to a microwave"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Great Pan, Great Price","The reality is this is a $250, professional quality, extraordinarily versatile, big beautiful pan for just a hundred bucks.  If you are going to buy one good non-stick pan, make it this one.  It cooks rings around hhe Farberware, Revereware, and T-Fal non-stick fry pans you get at Target and Wal-Mart and will last three our four times longer. "

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Double Boiler Purchase,I've had a complete set of Revere Ware for over 30 years with the 2-quart double boiler as another treasured addition. It has upheld the sturdy construction from years past. I do anxiously hope to find a 1-quart double boiler as a more usable size. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Rich, Bright Glaze with Classic Lines",This is a wonderful bowl for a centerpiece and don't hesitate to also use it as a serving bowl. Fiestaware is famous for its excellent glazes and this piece does not disappoint. The cinnabar color is particularly nice to use around Christmas time. I also ordered the sauceboat w/platter to go along with this (although Amazon still hasn't shipped it) and plan on having a killer tablescape this Christmas

kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Well worth the investment!,"I have owned my 12 piece Farbeware set for the past 26 years. My mom's set is 37 years old. We both cook every day. Our sets were manufactured here in the states,(the factory used to be in the Bronx, NYC). They included a 1,2,3,4 and 8qt pots with 7 & 12 inch stainless steel frying pans. My sister has the present 10 piece set also with stainless steel frying pans and it was not manufactured in the states, she's owned hers for 12years. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Better than I expected!,"After I bought my Calphalon cookware I knew I would continue to buy their products because they are very good quality, especially for the price.  I know their cookware & kitchen utensils are good, but I wasn't sure about their cutlery (some companies make quality cookware but poor quality knives).  So I decided to take a chance & get the 8"" Chef's knife and I am so glad I did!  I think this knife is beautiful & the perfect weight.  I really like the handle & it feels nice and balanced in my hand.  It didn't come out of the box quite as sharp as I'd like it to be, but it's definitely sharp enough.  I can't wait to get more knives & the maple block!  This knife is great for everyday use!"

kitchen & housewares,30 of 34,4.0,Not As Easy As It Seems,"Am I the only person who ever bought this and tried to use regular boxed cake mixes with it?  For anyone who hasn't tried it yet, guess what, you may end up with a huge mess.  First, about half of a batch of boxed mix is all that will fit into these very shallow pans.  (Remember you need two colors for a checkerboard effect.)  Second, you really have to use the same brand and type of cake mix for both colors.  If they don't rise and bake at the same rate, your checkerboard will look more like marble cake.  My suggestion is that instead of using two different flavor cake mixes, just use a white cake mix and divide it into two parts.  Color half with food coloring to give you the checkerboard effect.  The directions say to fill pans no more than half-way, and they aren't kidding.  I cut off and threw away more than was left in the pan on my first try.  Maybe it depends on the mix, and how much it rises. The third problem should have been obvious, but I'm not that clever.  This is a THREE LAYER CAKE so it won't fit into any of my domed cake plates, and a single batch of icing was not enough. Anyway, I cook more for pleasure than necessity, and this was just a little more annoying than I had planned.  I'm not giving up, but the pursuit of the perfect checkerboard cake has so far eluded me"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,poor can opener,"I purchased this can opener and I loved it the first few times I used it, Now I hate it. It doesn't open the can completely leaving a very dangerous and sharp lid for me to pull off. I don't know if they can be sharpened, but for now it sits in a drawer. Maybe I will call Kitchenaid. As I own everthing they make."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Bodum French Press,"This is THE brand to use if you use a French press.  You will never have any trouble with coffee grounds in your coffee.  The press fits perfectly and the screen is fine enough to keep even the smallest grinds from leaking through.  Only one caution, 4 cups means 4 small cups of coffee.  If you use a mug, its 2 1/2 to 3. "
kitchen & housewares,20 of 20,4.0,"THE CHAMPAGNE IS FLAT, THE BURGUNDY IS FINE","IF YOU EXAMINE THESE SETS YOU WILL FIND THAT THE CHAMPAGNE SET SHOULDN'T EVEN BE INCLUDED WITH THE BLACK, BLUE OR BURGUNDY SETS. THE CHAMPAGNE SET IS ABOUT 5 POUNDS LIGHTER AND IS AN INFERIOR SET WHEN COMPARED TO THE OTHER THREE COLORS. THE CHAMPAGNE SET IS OFTEN ON SALE AND ALWAYS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE OTHER COLORS AT THIS SITE. I'VE WRITTEN AN EMAIL TO AMAZON EXPLAINING THAT THIS CHAMPAGNE SET IS NOT ACTUALLY JUST A COLOR OPTION OF THE FARBERWARE PRODUCT REPRESENTED BY THE BLACK, BLUE, AND BURGUNDY SETS...BUT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND INFERIOR LEVEL OF FARBERWARE SETS. A YEAR LATER AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED. SO, IF A MODEST SET WILL DO, GET THE CHAMPAGNE SET FOR ABOUT 50 TO 60 DOLLARS OR LESS. IF YOU WANT A BETTER QUALITY OF FARBERWARE, GET THE OTHER COLORS FOR ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH OR SO. GOOD LUCK"

Some of my staff mention that it is a bit heavier than the modern design counterparts. They also mention that they like the clear plastic reservoirs of the more modern units as they can see the water level.  However the iron appears to be well constructed and very sturdy. Time will tell if it holds up to leaking reservoirs, stained sole plates and worn out heating units of many of the other brands that we have used over the past years.  From a price perspective it was a very good deal"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,On the other hand - ,"I purchased this same tea kettle a couple of years ago and the first time I used it though the tornado alarm across the football field from my house was going off.  There were two sounds (similar to a factory whistle from the 40's) - it was, after the initial shock, a blessing to me because I have tinitus that happens to be exactly the same pitch as most tea kettles.  I've burned several tea kettles in the past because I couldn't hear the whistle over the ringing in my ears from tinitus.  Believe me, this noisy little tea kettle will never, ever burn.  I can even hear it in the bathroom and bedroom.  It's a pretty little pot and everyone always comments on it.  The previous buyer should have contacted the manufacturer and asked for a mailing label so he could return it and get one that worked"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 9,2.0,Need Your Prompt Response,"Unfortunately, I am not able to rate this product as looks like after going through a lot of expense and problems of purchasing the the special chlorx non bleach liquid from USA, the rubber strip from the MOP got detached after 1st use.  What happened is at the first round, it did a great job of cleaning and drying, however, on it's second round the rubber strip fell out and I have no way to put it back as I do not see any special slot gor it to go back.  So ever since I am using the MOP as is.  Although it is doing ok job it does not dry or clean as well as when the rubber strip was attached.  I really do not know how to get hold of some one from Amazon to complain about this.  As you know I buy quite a few items off the line with you, this is my 1st dissatisfaction.  And since I feel it is just for a defective merchandise, I ought to report it to you before discrediting your services.  I also did not get a 15% off coupon for the assessories as mentioned in the registration.  I certainly hope you will advise me as how to have this problem eradicated through your system, without me actully chasing the manufaturer."

I have 10 place settings plus lots of ""extras"" & it sets a handsome table.  The dishes go safely in the microwave, they go through the dishwasher just fine as well.  With their unusual finish...primitive, then the splash of glaze on each, I was unsure how they'd stand up.  They are also pretty break resistant too.  I've only lost one cup & that was due to my ceramic tile countertops and ceramic tile floor.  The warm earthy tones of this dinnerware makes it easy to tie in other earthtones for napkins, centerpiece, etc.  They look quite fine on my cream colored rattan table.  And after all...choosing a dinnerware set is a whole lot more than just selecting something ""suitable""...it's great fun to have it ""glow"" whether it's a dinner for 2 or a luncheon for 10.  Yes...I am very pleased with the quality, style, & durability of Sango Splash!! "

Well, never fear, Amazon.com is here!  After doing a search, I was ecstatic to find the Chantel mugs and I bought one in each of the four colors available at this time.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,An Amazing Kettle,"I do not understand the negative reviews about this kettle.  I've used it on both electric and gas stoves, and the handles are always cool to the touch.  It boils water perfectly, and is positively wonderful to use, in fact, using this kettle actually improves my mood because it is so cleverly designed, it's like the Lexus of Tea Kettles.  I have yet to see any room for improvement, or for that matter, any kettle that is even close to as good as this. You will never burn yourself with this kettle, it boils water effectively, the whistle works perfectly, there is no hot steam scorching your hand when pouring out the last drops, and it is beautiful.  If you're in the market for a tea kettle, look no further, this is the one"

kitchen & housewares,0 of 2,5.0,"Don't waste your money on ""As Seen On TV"" products!","The first time I needed these they failed on me.  They are made of the thinnest, cheapest plastic imaginable.  I am convinced now, and should have been BEFORE I bought these, that stuff sold only on TV is done so for a reason.  It's because it is next to impossible to return anything.  If the stuff was a wonderful as they claim on infomercials, it would be in retail stores in a heartbeat.  Go to your local hardware store instead and buy slightly more expensive sliders.  They will have different ones to suit your needs"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Add me to the disappointed list!,"Like so many others, I bought my electric skillet in the Spring of 2006.  Within 30 days, it stopped working...I used it TWICE.  Amazon.com replaced it with another.  However, it, too, stopped working in the middle of a party while making tempura.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,TIMER IS NOT INCLUDED,Nice coffee press...but don't expect to find a timer in the box like the 'other pictures' show...because IT ISN'T INCLUDED.  Bodum cheaped out and stopped including the timer apparently which stinks.  I bought 4 of these for gifts and was expecting to find the 4-minute timer inside...but found NADA.  Oh well..

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Coffee grinder,Product is bullet proof and effective.  A djustable grind options adequate for 99% of population.  Cleaning easy and accessable.  Original glass ground coffee catcher did not fit correctly - KitchenAid Pro Line customer service immediately responsive with replacement.  Instruction book easily understood and well made.  Pearl Metallic color probably fits most kitchen decors.  Grinding noise level quite low compared to other burr grinders and especially low compared to blade grinders.  I own three of these grinders. I don't anticipate needing another.  Best price point found on Amazon.
kitchen & housewares,13 of 15,1.0,Not worth ordering,"     I've had two of these.  Despite a great design, the quality is unfortunately seriously flawed."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,4.0,Make it Stop!,"This machine will blend anything!  It beat my KitchenAid hands down in that department.  The problem is the noise the machine produces on every cycle.  It's as loud as an outboard motor. We are afraid of receiving complaints in our condominium when blending our morning smoothies!  Seriouly folks, a pair of earplugs should be included in every box."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Keep Looking,"The opener is too fragile for the task.  The serrated blade is held in place by thin, brittle plastic that is easily broken if one inadvertantly twists or ""levers"" the handle even slightly up from the plane of the lid - easy to do with a tight lid. "

kitchen & housewares,,1.0,"makes excellent rice, but only for 3 months","We've gone through two of these now, though not purchased from amazon. No way would we buy another one. They work fine for awhile, then suddenly stop working. No heat, just nothing at all. We're not heavy users, either; we make 2-3 cups of rice once or twice a week. Now we're shopping for a new rice maker, but it definitely won't be an Oster"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Another Expensive Junky Toaster.,"Here's another expensive piece of junk toaster that I was conned into buying. Actually I went off the consumer reports web-site that gave the two slice model top ratings, so I thought this one was a good gamble... Not."

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great Eggs,"I have owned my egg cooker for about a year and it was actually a replacement for one that I used so much I finally wore it out. I have read a few reviews from people who said it makes a mess inside and out (egg exploding & water leaking). First of all, the piercer that comes with it on the end of the water measuring cup is to actually PIERCE the egg on one end so the pressure inside does not cause it to burst and leak out all over the inside of the cooker. Didn't you ever wonder what the needle was for? Or read about it? Second of all, the water leakage is more than likely due to a factory defect. Mine has been working leak free for a year, but my old one did start to leak after many years of usage."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Perfect for all bakers!!,"I bought this a week before Thanksgiving. It is amazing! Easy to use, and easy to clean up. The only downfall I can think of is that the parts are NOT dishwasher safe, but it's not that bad. I have used 2 of the 3 attatchements, and it was simple. It doesn't matter how often you would use it, it's definately a kitchen staple!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 7,1.0,"Love the dinnerware, hate the mugs!","The design of the mug handles is such that one cannot drink hot liquids without burning the skin of the fingers that are inside the handle.  If I could replace just the mugs, I'd be a happy camper"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,An Outstanding Bundt Pan!!!,"I am a Regular bundt baker. I have always used just the basic joe-schmo bundt pan...no biggie. With this Nordic Ware Rose pan, Oh my gosh! It just fell out with no effort on my part. With my other pan, I had to heavily grease and flour...and just pray it didn't stick too much. With the Nordic Ware, I lightly brushed with oil, and like pure heaven, my bundt came out so perfect! It cooked so evenly, and the inside so moist...such a huge difference, especially when it's with the same recipe that I have always used. I just love it! Last night, I bought 3 more Nordic Ware pans...the Poinsettia, (for the holidays), the Heart, (Valentines), and the basket weave with the fruit imprints on top. I know these pans are not cheap, BUT the quality of these pans, for me, makes all the difference in the world"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Poor quality control; poorly manufactured.,"I recently installed a wall-mounted Calphalon pot rack, which I like a lot.  Unfortunately, the two hooks I just ordered both fail to work properply with the potrack.  One is simply too small to fit onto the rack; the other one fits on but is too large, and comes off when removing pans.  Additionally, these hooks are either made from a different material and/or finsihed differently from the ones that shipped with pot rack originally."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Healthy Tacos Shells!,This is a great baking rack for small tortillas. I've baked only flour shells and they are crunchy and delicious. Something to keep in mind is baked shells will never taste like or have the texture of fried shells. If you're looking for a healthy option and are willing to give-up a little bit of the taste and texture - then get baking with this pan today
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great Knife - Watch your fingers!,"We bought this knife as a replacement to some Henckel paring knives that have mysteriously disappeared from our house.  Tried it out the same day it arrived & it appears to be great so far.  Nice weight, handles well & is super sharp - so sharp my husband & I both cut ourselves by barely touching the blade! (Cut was so fine that it healed by the next day.)  So far so good - we'll report back after the first sharpening"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best coffee maker for the money!,"I bought two of these machines - on for at home and one for the office. The coffee is so rich, smooth, and frothy that the otherwise premium coffee at work just doesn't cut it anymore"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Bad company to deal with,"I purchased this rotisserie and like all the other reviews I loved it from the very first chicken I cooked.  As a new owner, I was looking for any excuse to use my new rotisserie and used it several times.  The problem came when after about 10 days the gear wheel broke.  I immediately contacted Ronco because as a good customer the first thing I did when opening the box was to go online and complete the warranty registration.  Boy was I ever shocked to find out that they would not replace the broken part.  They said that the retailer I purchased it from was responsible and the retailer said that if it had been used several times and wasn't defective from the start that I needed to contact the manufacturer.  This was eventually settled and the retailer took it back but I will not waste my money on another Ronco product again"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Good, but  tablespoon marks would have been thoughtful","Works well, and very useful for the sticky stuff, as other reviewers note.  However, I consider it a foolish design oversight that there are no tablespoon marks, when it is such a common unit for liquid measurements.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,One of my favorite baking pans,"I use this pan 2-3 times per week and have never had a problem with it; I've also given it as a gift once in the past and will buy another for a gift this month.  It allows the baguette to develop a crispy, even crust.  A tip:  add about 1/4 cup of water to the oven before adding the pan with dough to create an ideal crust. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Wayyyy cute!,"While I agree that the pan isn't very non-stick, after some testing, I pressed the regular round paper liners into the heart shape.  I didn't overfill the muffin cups, and they were TOTALLY cute!  They were a big hit at both the preschool and the office.  They're a little smaller, so a regular 24 cupcake recipe makes more like 32 extremely cute cupcakes.  I have 2 pans, am thinking of getting 2 more to speed the baking"

All in all...I do like it!

The turquoise place setting is beautiful...It is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com...Fiestaware is functional, calssic and fun- I love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this.  I highly recommend mixing and matching Fiestaware. I mix up colors that you wouldn't normally expect to go together and they usually look great"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0, Bunn MCP My Cafe Professional-Grade Single-Serve Coffee/Tea Machine ,"I tried almost all the coffee pod coffee makers. The Cafe Professional-Grade Single-Serve Coffee/Tea Machine is by far the best. Makes great coffee and tea. The coffee comes out hot, not warm like the others. You can use any coffee pod you want and you can select how strong or weak you want your coffee or tea. Don't forget the tea. a lot of machines don't make tea. You can even use regular store bought tea bags, just remove the tag. Cost more but well worth it."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Found cause of leaking... No solution yet...,"Our steamer is about 1 year old.  It leaked like everyone elses but not badly so I ignored it.  However, a month ago the plug under the clean water and soap container poped out.  It's just a piece of plastic with a spring on it that holds all the soap and water in.  I poped it back in and it stayed... Until the next time I took off the clean water tank to empty it... pop goes the plug and out flows a half gallon of water!  Now every time the clean water bucket is removed, out pops the plug and out flows the water."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Nice little bowls,"I don't think I can really say much about these... but, they're very stylish looking, feel extremely sturdy, and the price is great. Very roomy bowls, and they fit quite a bit. I also clumsily managed to drop one on the floor, and it didn't break, but don't go trying that over and over for fun."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Chef's Choice Pizzelle Gril,"The Chef's Choice Pizzelle Pro Express Bake is fast, and very easy to use and clean.  The measuring spoon and ready light take the guess work out of making perfect three cookies at a time.  The thickness of each cookie is consistent, because of the fastener clip.  I have used two other manufacturer pizzelle grills and found the Chef's Choice is far superior  and reasonably priced. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,A water filter that is doing its job!,I have been using Brita water filter for two years.  The bottom line is that it works!  The water tastes fresh without the odor
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,"Nicely crafted, unique size versatile pot!",I bought this last summer for cooking aspargus and I really love it.  It also works great for cooking 2-3 ears of corn.  It is skinny enough that even a few asparagus pieces will stand in the pot and then of course cook perfectly---allowing the tougher bottoms to get a little more heat.  I honestly used it almost as much for sweet corn as I did for asparagus---just add a little water in the bottom and the corn steams done in just a few minutes and tastes wonderful.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great pan but easy to kill.,"Pan is well made and transfers heat uniformly. This was my favorite (non cast iron) fry pan until I let it overheat once. Now the teflon is dull and no longer ""non-stick"". My recommendation is to buy cheap teflon skillets and throw them away when they go bad. I really like my other All-Clad pots and pans, none of which are teflon coated. In order to save this hi end skillet I sanded off the teflon and polished the stainless steel underlayer. (This was a labor intensive and time consuming process)"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,MIU France Stainless Steel Potato Presser,"A really good tool for the kitchen.  It makes making mashed potatoes as easy as boiling water.  You don't even have to peal them, just squeeze them through the skin and they are ready to add milk, butter, salt and pepper.  Clean up is easy also, just put in the dishwasher and turn it on."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Just as I remember,"I had a similar coffee maker years ago and was pleased to find that I could still obtain a replacement.  It works great.  It brews an excellent cup of coffee in a very short period of time.  My only negative comment is that once you have removed the full cup from the machine, a few drips continue to fall on to the cup holding surface and you have to wipe them up.  It sure would be nice if it had an anti-drip valve"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,2.0,"nice idea, but...",the cofee carafe keeps brew hot for hours! I have had 4 spillages and alot of mess to clean up because the filter must be aligned properly or else! I also cannot figure out how to program... one of the most important features for me buying...  I really wish I could send this back
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Love that Thumper,"This will be the third Thumper I've bought.  Lost the first one on a trip, second is still going strong after 5 or 6 years and the third is for a gift.  It's simple to use, loud enough to wake you and doesn't mind a good smack in the morning when you want 5 more minutes.  The thumper pad is big enough to hit when you're groggy!  More products should be as easy to live with as this one! "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"Quirky glasses, great conversation starters","I love these glasses!  Skewed to the left (or right, depending on how you hold it), unusual margarita glasses add some fun to the prospect of holding on to a glass all evening.  Excellent quality, with a nice weight to the glasses and pitcher.  All around, excellent choice!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,I LOVE THIS PATTON FAN,"We had this same fan years ago.  We loved it, and it laster for over l0 years.  Since then I have been trying to find another one in MD/DC hardware stores, but I hadn't seen one.  Finally I found it on the Amazon web site.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,You can't go wrong with this grater.,"I love these microplane graters (I have three in different sizes) because you're able to grate food with very little pressure.  They're extremely sharp and mine haven't dulled after three years of frequent use.  Actually, that's the only negative; you must be very careful of your fingers when grating small items (I've added more flavoring to my meal than intended on a few occasions!).  Food particles rinse off pretty easily with running water or you can throw them in the dishwasher and they'll come out spotless.  This is the best one to buy as your first microplane grater since the size is pretty versatile for cheese, veggies, chocolate, or wax or soap for candle and soap-making"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,You'll love it!,I certainly do. It cooks fast and is very convenient. I recommend spraying the cooking surfaces with a little oil for easier clean up. I wasn't overly impressed with the cleaning sponge included so I just use one I picked up at the store.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works Great,"I haven't used this disc for ice, but it is a miracle worker for hard cheeses.  It is not as light and airy as a Microplane, but it is light and fluffy. If you need a large amount for a recipe, this will take minutes off your prep time.   I have no regrets about this purchase"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Wonderful Set and Great Buy,"The knives are better than expected, sharp, comfortable on your hands and a great bargain for the price.  In fact, we purchased an additional set of the steak knives.  They are really sharp as well.  The free $75 worth of Omaha Steaks was an additional plus for the purchase, too.  We highly recommend these knives and hope you enjoy them as much as we do"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Better than Starbuck's,"This machine is really just as advertised - one touch capuccino and espresso with enormous customization. You can adjust the coffee strength independent of the volume (ristretto to lungo).  The milk frother works wonderfully with good tight foam, and is mixed with the coffee in the cup in perfect ratio.  It produces capuccino just as good as Starbucks (assuming you use Starbucks beans), and more consistent (sometimes, depending on the barista, the capuccino can be weaker or stronger based on the amount of milk added)."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,Not Kitchen Aid Quality,"Bought one of these openers at outlet in Blowing Rock, NC . It worked well for all of two days, then the opener teeth became completely unable to bite into any can rim. Threw it in the garbage as it was worthless. What a bad joke"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Smoothie Heaven!,"I had a Halloween housewarming party. I got this as a gift. Just this week I opened it and tried it. I love it. Makes the perfect blended smoothie. I like that it comes with recipes. The recipes are simple to follow and are printed on cardstock ready to be put in a recipe box. I will definitely be trying also to make blended coffee drinks and blended margaritas, yum. I haven't experinced any problems with the machine as some other reviewers have."

The food cooks evenly and the nice size basket allows you to put a larger quanity of food in for a compact fryer.Easy to clean and fits just perfectly under my counter. Cuisinart products have always been good to me
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,1.0,Flat out didn't work!,"First of all, I *did* think highly of Rowenta and to be very honest... I still think they make great steam irons, probably some of the best on the market. However, this particular product has left a bad taste in my mouth that comes very close to ruining my total faith in Rowenta. Like most people, I would sacrifice paying a little more knowing that in return I would get a sound product. That was my initial feeling considering that the Conair handheld steamers are almost half to a third less than these. However, the ""Steam N' Press"" falls far short of any reasonable expectations. Not only did it fail me... it failed twice in a row. At this moment I'm preparing for a few business trips and need a steamer for my iron sensitive clothing. I should've heeded the warnings here on Amazon and looked past this steamer since the other model (DA-75) got such bad reviews. But, since it did have the dual voltage feature and 2 large local retailers sold the device I went ahead and purchased it (from the store that rhymes with drys). When I got home I was eager to test it out since my first trip is at the end of this week. Put water into the steamer, waited a minute, waited two minutes, waited a couple more minutes... nothing, not even a drop. Pressed the button a few times and it began to spit rather than steam, in fact no steam came out of it. I thought, ""Oh great, it doesn't work!"" It did get quite hot and as an iron it would probably be okay but this is not why I bought it! So... I return it that same day to exchange for another thinking... ""What are the chances that two won't work?"" And, guess what?... I think those chances are pretty good since the same thing happened. Anyway, to cut a long story short, returned the steamer and didn't feel up to test the 3rd time's a charm theory. Who knows, maybe it was a bad batch, but it's hard to believe that any of the previous ""made in germany"" irons would fail this much. Btw, the iron did have a sticker that stated that it might still contain water from the ""factory test"". Obviously, I had quite a laugh at the ""Iron""y"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great Value,I received this comforter and was pleased immediately!  It's very pretty and seems to be of decent quality.  It inspired me to redecorate my room and I can't believe what a difference it makes
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great versatile fan,"We got this fan to cool off an office with lots of computers in it.  I really like the compact size, which fits under the desk.  The remote is very convenient when you have it set up in an awkward spot.  It puts out a lot of wind and has lots of settings to suit any mood"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Don't wash these often!,"I bought 2 of these blankets, one for each of my kids.  They provide extra warmth to their bed, and that's about it.  I am SO glad I didn't pay more than $10 for these a piece. Not worth it. Every time I have to wash these (and with kids currently potty training, they need to be washed!), the decorative trim on the top of the blanket.. the hem?..  gets more and more ratty, pulling apart from the main piece of fabric. Every time I  wash them, I have to get the scissors out, and it is driving me insane"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Great, Easy to Use Peeler","I am a fan of the Y-peeler and this one is very good.  I especially like the longer handle.  Be careful, as with all new peelers, the blade is sharp (a good thing).  I recommend getting this one"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,5.0,I love fiestaware,I started collecting fiestaware and thought I would only want green and yellow but now I love all the colors and was disappointed to find that black is rare where I live.

kitchen & housewares,48 of 50,4.0,"Great stainless steel, but skillets are 100% aluminum.","We're happy with our 20-year-old Farberware stainless steel cookware, pre-dating the stainless steel capped base. The interiors are still like new.  The lids are shiny and dent-free.  The handles are faded, but remain tight with an occasional turn of a screw.  We use it everyday. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Take it to the edge...,"I like these knives for two simple reasons; when properly sharpened, the blade will slice through steak so sweetly and cut an onion paper thin.  I don't baby them either...I run them through the dishwasher, sharpen, and then oil them before I put them away.  My wife recently bought a set of high dollar serrated knives with some kind of polycarbonate handle (neither one of us like each others knife choices).  I think they're disgusting, if I wanted to `saw' through my food I would have purchased a hand saw for much less"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,1.0,Disintegrates if used for ice drink,"I'm not sure what's going on here, cuz half these reviews seem to say it works great.  I decided to make a daquiri using the simple recipe of a Bacardi mixer, rum and ice.  I've done this in an el cheapo Osterizer by pre-crushing the ice with an ice crusher.  The selling point for this was that I could just put in the ice cubes and skip the extra step."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Mrs. Shopper1,Love This item!  Gorgeous and quality is just great!  Have gotten rave compliments and the cooking quality is awesome.  Super duper product
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Kudos for an elegant 2-in-1 product,The Nissan Thermos stainless steel beverage can insulator is one of those rare finds on the road of life. Were it not for my previous experience with the quality of Nissan Thermos products I might not have given it a second look.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Very Useful,"I got a deal on this monster a few years ago and bought it even though I thought it was way bigger than I would ever need. WRONG! It has become one of the most used items in my kitchen. Large batches of soups or sauces are never a problem, and any extra room just keeps things cleaner due to reduced splash. This pot will hold a good sized turkey, or 3 whole chickens, or 1 whole pork shoulder, etc, etc. Quality construction, very useful, long life. Also, a canners dream. Buy it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent dishware,"You just can't go wrong with Fiestaware.  It's sturdy, durable, attractive, cleans up easily (from table to dishwasher to cabinet).  And if my rough-on-dishes family can't break it, no one can"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Burrow Bed,I bought two of these bed for my mini-dachsunds.  The beds are attractive and well made. My dogs really enjoy them
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Bought too many coffee makers?  Try this one!,"We have gone through over 4 coffee makers this year and we FINALLY found one we love.  It is great!  No leaky pot, no grounds in the coffee, great tasting java!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Changed Slightly,"For all those wanting to add to their set, be warned - they have changed the knife handle slightly. They are now thinner and not as heavy. The change is visually noticable. I bought my original set five or so years ago. The other handles (forks and spoons) are the same. I guess I really like them since I bought more"
kitchen & housewares,31 of 35,4.0,Great for cakes,"A lifelong cake lover, I bought these pans about a month ago and have been using them ever since. They're sturdy, but not so heavy that that they're hard to lift. And the nonstick surface is great for quickly getting cakes out of the pan without tearing the bottoms"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,5.0,all-clad stainless is the way to go,I love all my all-clad cookware - it heats evenly and the handles don't get hot on the stove.  I purchased this little pan to warm sauces and make hot cocoa and it does what I needed it to do
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Nice Pillows,"I purchased 4 of these pillows after sleeping on a set of down pillows at Double Tree Inn.  However, I must say, I almost sent these pillows back to Amazon due to the smell.  The only reason I didn't was because we went on a two-week honeymoon.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,great item,This fits the curve of the kitchen aid mixer bowl perfect to scrape the sides when needed. Easy to use and flexable
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Chantal 48-ounce Tea Steep,"I love this tea pot. It's sturdy, colorful and just the right size"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Great size, great design","I love this pan.  The shape is perfect.  I use it for noodle soup a lot - it's just the right size.  It's slightly wider on top to keep from boiling over.  The lid is well designed - looks great, and easy to clean.  No more food stuck at the edge of the lid.  I use it almost everyday"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Excellent for the price,Pros: Nice fryer for the price. I like being able to sick all the pieces in the dish washer after use. The filter is nice so that you can get more uses out of the oil. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Beautiful & useable,"I absolutely LOVE my new set of dishes - they're so pretty on the table. I love that the patterns are different but still go together so well. I know some people don't like the shallow bowl, but I think it's perfect for use, especially as a plate for my 3-year old. They wash up easily, and I haven't had any issues with putting them in the dishwasher. I have no complaints - can't wait until the accessories come out"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 20,5.0,A Le Creuset junkie,"I cook exclusively with Le Creuset, and I love this skillet as I do all my other pieces.  They cook food beautifully and are easy to clean.  The only time I had something to really stick, I was able to get it out by putting a little detergent and water in the pan and heating it up a bit.  The stuck-on bits floated right up to the top"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,My favorite kitchen gadget,"After hearing so many problems with bacteria in the salad bags, I have decided to buy my own lettuce and vegetables.  I could never get them dry enough and I don't like soggy salad.  The OXO salad spinner is a worthwhile tool.  I spin the lettuce or vegetables and am able to store them with the cover top.  It does take up alot of space in the refrigerator but my lettuce greens stay greener longer.  I would recommend this to anyone.  An extra bonus, the kids like to play with it too"
kitchen & housewares,38 of 42,2.0,Physics of press leaves much to be desired. From a Chicano.,"There's often a construction detail that is left out in manufacturing these. Though this thing does press the masa into a disk, it will come out uneven in thickness. If you watch the top plate when you press the masa ball, the top plate will warp or bow as the masa lump resists it in the middle. The tortilla is pinched thinner near the handle. That's one problem. The other problem is the gap between the plates near the hinge. I don't think the manufacturers carefully gauge the gap between the plates nearest the hinge. If the plates actually touch near the hinge area, and they often do, the masa gets extremely pinched to transparency in that area. If this happens along with the warping when pressing, you get a tortilla that is fat in the middle and piched at two edges. Viewing it on edge you get a flying saucer shape."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,5.0,Definatly a good deal,It's a great deal for the price and quality. They don't stick and are easy to clean
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Happy  Corelle User,I have one form of arthritis - so I had to give up my other tableware for it was too heavy for me.  I had problems clearing the table and putting dishes away in the cupboard.  The light weight of the Corelle Ware is so much better.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product and Good Value,"My grandmother's pasta pot developed a split in its bottom after countless use. I worried that it would be hard to replace, but this pot is much better than hers. Easy to use and clean with plenty of room for enough water to cook a pound of pasta. That's the secret to good pasta, plenty of water. The lid and handle design is an excellent example of form and function. Well done Farberware!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,What's the big deal?,"I saw before I bought this, many people write reviews where they had problems with the product before I bought it.  Let me tell you that I've had none of those problems whatsoever.  This dishwasher has worked pretty much perfectly since I bought it.  I did encounter some water leakage a couple times, but I determined that had something to do with the unit's angle -- my apartment for some reason isn't level.  So I adjustted it so it was level and it worked."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Much More than a Casserole,"I first started seeing this pan on Giada De Laurentis' cooking show ""Everyday Italian"" when I began collecting Le Creuset.  I didn't know it as a casserole at the time since it more resembles the ""Everyday Pans"" being sold by manufactuers like Calphalon and All-Clad."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,All-SOLD on All-Clad!  Love this set!,"After watching my mother use her All-Clad tool set over the last two years, and seeing how well it has held up, I decided to go ahead and purchase this item.  I have not been disappointed, the quality is amazing.  The tools have a very solid feel to them, yet they are balanced and not too heavy.  They clean SO easily, and are even dishwasher safe.  We are throwing away all of our old tools and replacing them with All-Clad - it's amazing!  Amazon's price can't be beat.... I know for a fact that my Mom paid full retail through a very well known catalog (ending in Sonoma).  Amazon's price was half of that.  If you are contemplating this set, DO IT!  You won't regret it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,sanyo steamer,"I have had my rice steamer for a week now. looks like it is made well. I went over the cooking time and my rice did not burn, I did not set the timer right,my fault I was just trying to learn to use it.I put stuff in the vegetable tray for a complete meal.I was never a big rice eater but I am on a low fat diet now. after looking over many rice cook books, looks like there is many rice recipes from all over the world as every country eats rice.you can get a lot of sauces and mixes for rice in the grocery store"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 18,5.0,I loved it!,"It may seem strange - but this was the perfect Baby Shower gift for a friend of mine.  She's very into organic foods, and uses this constantly for baby food - especially some very incredible apple sauce"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works Wonderfully,"I have a french bread recipe I have used for years.  Without the pan, the bread was good.  With this pan, the bread is fantastic.  The crust is crusty; the inside is perfect.  I followed the direcions on the pan to spray with a non-stick spray, and the bread released without any problems.  I would recommend this to everyone who bakes french bread. "

The Figure Piping Ideas book can be  ordered from Amazon.com under books
kitchen & housewares,4 of 20,1.0,Very Unhappy with Buying from Amazon Partners,"I ordered this as a Christmas present in the beginning of December. Of course, when I ordered it, it showed as ""in stock."" Well, needless to say, since it was an Amazon partner, it wasn't really in stock. So, here I am in mid February, the stupid cutting board just shipped, and Amazon just added a recommended item to my store - the same damned cutting board for half the price I paid! And it was already supposed to be half price! Needless to say, after this and other bad experiences with Amazon partners, I won't be ordering from a partner again. My suggestion: only order from Amazon directly; never trust the partners"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Great hostess gift idea,"I suggest keeping a few of these inexpensive, well-made trays on hand for hostess and party gifts. I'm using mine at the table to hold salt/pepper, napkins and such"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,excellent product and company,"i was very excited when i looked on amazon and found this product around $10 cheaper than on the web site from the company where i bought my refrigerator.  i was a little hesitant (always being a believer in ""you get what you pay for""), but figured i'd give it a try.  to my surprise, the item was received only 2 days after i placed the order.  i even installed it myself with no problems"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Pans!,I got four of these pans for pazookies (chocolate chip cookies with ice cream and whipped cream on top)! I use them all the time for desserts. Makes great desserts for couples to share and also great pan pizzas for kids
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,The Essential Lodge Dutch Oven,"The Lodge cast iron Dutch oven is an essential for anyone who loves to cook.  Once you get the knack of cooking with cast iron, i.e., keeping it properly seasoned and using its heat retention properties to your advantage, it's a wonderful pot for stews,  braising, or even avoiding spatter when browning. Without the lid it can be used for roasting - although a trivet would be advisable for that use. The Dutch oven can be used on the stove, in the oven or even over a campfire. It will last for generations and poses no worries about chipping, staining or wearing out as do enameled cast iron pots.  Cleaning is very easy if cast iron is kept properly seasoned.  If something does burn on, first soaking in water and then scraping gently with a plastic blade usually does the trick.  The single drawback with cast iron is the fact that it's heavy.  But, of course, from the standpoint of cooking, that is also a major advantage."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Fantastic juicing device,"After reading reviews here, I was skeptical of this juicer attachment.  But upon receipt I got busy with some lemons and had a great time!  It was easy to use and did a wonderful job!  Love it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Replacement after 20+ years,"Great kettle, fast heating.  Without a fill-hole on the top, steam doesn't escape when pouring - a great feature.  Easy to use pouring spout.  The whistle fell off after 22 years of use and then it was a month after that the plastic melted because the whistle wasn't working and I wasn't paying attention.  Easy to keep clean - wipe it off when wiping down the stove after cooking."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 13,2.0,BATH SHEETS,ONE OF THE BATH SHEETS IS FLAWED.  BUT I DON'T FEEL THAT AN EXCHANGE WOULD BE WORTHWHILE
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Love It!!,I have been cooking for 30+ years and this is the best electric skillet I have every had.  The see thru cover is great!!  It is just my husband and I now - so it could of been a little smaller but works great when the kids come home!
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Bakes good bread even though the built of the machine is flimsy,"The machine was shipped with slight defects on the exterior. After notifying Amazon, I have received a small credit to compensate for the cosmetic defect. The machine bakes good bread with 1 lb to 2 lb capacity. The baking pan itself is very thin.. somewhat flimsy compared to my old machine before. However, that did not affect how the machine operate. Overall, I am happy with this purchase"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,A must have for every kitchen,"After comparing the various food processors in store and online from the reviews my decision was very simple: I went with the KitchenAid over the Cuisinart.  After having used it several times I am very happy with my purchase.  First made a marinara and used the shredder for the carrots and that went so fast and smooth I was in disbelief.  Then I reassembled it with the main blade and threw in the tomatoes, onion and garlic and everything was minced down to almost a puree status almost immediately with very little sound.  A dead bang winner in my book."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Fantastic bowl!,"I have this bowl in the plum but this sunflower is gorgeous too and I'm getting one of these (check out the scarlet too - whew!) and I absolutely LOVE it!  It doesn't hold a ton so if you're planning on using it for a spaghetti meal, forget it.  It will hold a 1lb. bag of frozen vegetables, a box of mac and cheese and about 2 15oz cans of veggies.  Great, great bowl, looks absolutely fabulous on the table, and the clean up is a breeze.  If you're looking to get tons of compliments on your table, buy this bowl! Awesome can't even say enough about it.  I highly recommend"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Made to Last,"I own seveal Corning Ware pieces, and was excited to receive this set as a wedding gift. It cleans up beautifully, and is durable! It is nice enough to put right on the table for serving."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Good unit for the price, Way better than Blade Grinder.","If you expect this unit to work as well as a $200 burr grinder, don't waste your money. However, if you are currently using a blade type coffee grinder and would like to dramatically improve the flavor of your home ground coffee beans, then this unit might be a good chose for you. I didn't want to spend the $100 plus for a grinder. Frankly, I wasn't convinced that a blade grinder versus a burr grinder would make a difference in the way the end coffee would taste. When my blade grinder finally died, I decided I wanted to test this theory that a burr grinder produced a better tasting cup of coffee with the same beans I was using in my blade grinder. You will read from many sources on the web that the blade grinders will over heat the beans during the grind, and this is the reason you get an off or bitter flavor. Well, I would feel the ground beans right after blade grinding and I could feel any heat buildup. They weren't even warm. So how could this cause any off flavor? "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,"Not a good buy, cheap, very fragile, easily breakable","I am not impressed with this product whatsoever.  If I had not thrown the packaging away they would have been returned.  Cheap glass, very fragile, not good quality at all.  You could never wash these in a dishwaster and you'll need to be very careful when washing by hand.  Much more flimsy than a cheap wine glass from Target, WalMart etc.  VERY unusual for Bodum as everything else I have purchased from them is excellent"
kitchen & housewares,20 of 22,5.0,A WONDERFUL OVEN,"I have this oven. It is such a delight to use. Along with being beautiful in my kitchen, it has a quiet running motor that  circulates the heat intermittenly so as not to dry out the food"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice dish,Works great and the handle on top is a much needed feature.  My old butter dish (not fiestaware)did not have one of these and that is how it broke by being dropped
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,@#$!@#-ing pot rack,"My girlfriend shops for stuff on the Internet. She sends me links in email and instant messenger of the stuff she is looking at every day. Every now and then, I ""surprise"" her by buying something she sent me a link to. This week, it was this hanging pot rack.  When it arrived in the mail, unable to keep the secret, I told her I was going to put it up that night. She pretended to be surprised, as usual. Anyway, that afternoon she told me that she had read the reviews here, and that the screws that came with it might not be long enough. I said something like ""well, if I need to get extra screws, I will"", and thought nothing more of it. Sigh. If only I had listened. So Thursday night after work, I unpacked the pot rack and attacked the wall with a stud finder and a pencil. That's when things started to go wrong. The walls in my house are made of thick plaster. After hours of trying to figure out the best way to hold the stud finder to get any reaction out of it, I finally realized that it wasn't going to be that easy. So, I resorted to the ""guess, and drill holes till you find one, then measure"" method. I got four holes in before I found the first stud. Thank goodness the studs were actually 16 inches apart."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,5.0,Nicely weighted,"This mid-priced line of Henckel knives, called &quot;Classic&quot; by the company, is a full-tang, single-piece, three-rivet line with sturdy black plastic handles. The handles are notched at the end to prevent the hand from sliding off during use. Although they are not razor sharp right from the package, their edges are sharp enough for the average cook. According to Henckel, all knives in this line are dishwasher safe, but you should expect more rapid dulling under the harsh conditions."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!,It is a beautifully designed and very high quality product.  It has plenty of room and is very stable on the counter.  After seeing it I would've expected to pay much more.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Perfect For 2,"This will cook a 4 1/2 pound chicken perfectly, just like the deli chickens. It may be small but of there are just 2 of you it is great and saves space."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 11,1.0,Coffee Maker pretending to be a tea maker,The tea produced with this device is not steeped.  The water simply runs through the tea leaves similar to how coffee is made.  I timed how long it took 28 oz of water to run through on the mild and strong settings. On the mild setting the cycle completed in 5 minutes 5 seconds.  On the strong setting the cycle completed in 5 minutes 19 seconds.  This is not a tea maker
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,Too Flexible,"The ends were too flexible and soft.  The items were returned.  However, if you like extremely flexible ends, these are the spatulas for you"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Very nice but small,These are very nice cups at a great price.  The only problem is they are kind of small by American standards.  Smaller than a typical mug.  A good size for kids though
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Still beautiful!,  I have had this set for 10 years and the pieces my children haven't lost still look shiny and new.  They've been through the dishwasher almost everyday. I'm so pleased with the weight and quality of this flatware that I'm going to order more to replace my missing pieces
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,1.0,USELESS,The OXO Miner does not mince. It only bruised basil and parsley. We are still trying to find out what we can use it for
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,I just bought a set and it rocks..........,"I have been using cheap and crappy sets all my life. Some of my former sets include Tfal and Ikea sets. The difference is huge in this sets and because they do not peel off as some of the nonstick, you do not end up poisoning yourself. They conduct heat well and clean beautifully. Plus they resist scratches. If you have to choose between this and the nonstick set, PLEASE BUY THIS ONE INSTEAD. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 12,4.0,Beautiful and functional but too expensive,"I went ahead and spent the extra $40 for the silicone handles and kind of wished I hadn't.  The set is BEAUTIFUL and the silicone handles provide a great grip, but it really wasn't worth $40!  I would buy the regular DuPont handles, but definitely buy the Kitchenaid set.  Work great, handy sharpener"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Excellent for everyday use!,"I adore this saucepan! I use it to make oatmeal, heat up soups, boil a single serving of pasta and prepare various sauces. Le Creuset pans tend to be heavy because of the cast iron, but this saucepan is easy to hold and carry. The sides are designed to help you pour liquids with no mess. The ultimate test for me was my homemade chocolate frosting. After melting semi-sweet chocolate chips into a heated mixture of sugar, milk and butter, I pour the hot frosting over my chocolate cherry cake. This saucepan made pouring and even spreading a breeze! Don't let the size (1 1/4-quart) fool you. It will hold quite a bit. And clean-up is so easy."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great for canning tomatoes,Seems to work great.  I canned about 20 quarts of tomatoes last week.  The only problem I had was keeping the pressure at 6. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,My favorite piece of cookware,"I use this skillet for everything, from searing meat to baking pizza at 500 degrees.

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,How did I live without it??,"This gadget has got the be the coolest thing I have bought for my kitchen in years (and I buy A LOT of things for my kitchen)!  We are getting ready to make apple butter for the first time (my husband misses his grandmother's homemade apple butter from PA) and I wasn't looking forward to peeling, coring, and cutting bushels of apples.  I saw this and figured it was worth the money to save my sanity!  We got it last night and grabbed a few apples to test out... it works PERFECTLY!  Even the kids are able to use it with no problems.  They were all sitting at the table with their own apple cut into a spiral in minutes.  AMAZING!  My husband is excited... now not only will he get his apple butter, but I will bake apple pies a lot more often!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,If you need hot water...,"Any one who drinks instant coffee, tea, powdered chochlate mix, etc must have one of these. It heats a cup of water to piping hot in about 30 seconds. Great product"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Love this toaster!!!,"We have one in our vacation home and I'm going to buy one for our primary residence as soon as we get back.  It DOES take up a lot of counter space, but its even toasting and easy controls are well worth it.  Plus it's attractively priced and is a good value for our busy (and hungry!) family"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Best Pan Ever,"After reading about possible cancer risks from non stick pans, I got a cast iron.  Now I'm going to get another smaller one and pitch all my teflon.  Cast iron requires a little extra care, but it works very, very well. "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,"Junk, do not waste your money","You truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend. "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Nice Set, Low Cost",This iced tea set is a nice addition to anyone's drinkware.  The only downside is that the pitcher tends to drip slightly after pouring

After all, I already have a ""standard"" citrus juicer, as well as a large juicer for throwing in the whole fruit. But after owning this a few month's, it is the one I turn to the most often.

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,awesome,"i totally disagree with the above person, as stated it is about four pounds.  it weighs that much because if it weighed any less it wouldnt have the power to actually work.  I make a lot of baked items, such as pound cakes, and muffins. it works like a dream. especially if you want to use it while you are also using a big mixer. and it's great for small jobs too, like slim fast milkshakes"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,"Easy to Use, Easy to Clean","This is a great little fryer.  It's easy to use, and SO EASY to clean.  Drain the oil into the included plastic container and put everything in the dishwasher.  What a breeze!  It is small - but we only cook for two people so that doesn't bother us.  The timer is pretty much useless, but for the price it was a great purchase"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,In the running for worst teapot ever...,"Yes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,1.0,Wouldn't take it if they gave it to me.,"This is a piece of garbage.  The torch will not stay lit for more than a few seconds.  When it is lit, the flame is weak, even at the highest setting.  Please, for the love of God, do not waste your money on this &quot;product.&quot;  A bic disposable lighter would work just as well.  Heck, a 100 watt bulb might work better"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,This is a must have!!!,"The Pyrex Portables Double Decker 9-Piece Set is very useful and handy to have on hand.  You can carry hot & cold items at the same time, by just using the handy hot/cold packs that comes with the set.  It is nice having everything in one portable case for easier carrying.  I do a lot of cooking for potlucks and usually carry 2 or 3 of the Pyrex Portables at the same time.  It is handy to have the food in one carrying case.  Pyrex items is always made of good quality materials and the same goes for the Double Decker 9-Piece set.  This would make a great gift for the person who likes to cook"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Speedy Delivery,"The product was delivered in a timely fashion and we have loved using it. They only reason it is not a five is that there are a couple of flaws on the finish. I did not notice this until the product has been used, but it does not interfere with using the dutch oven and the food has been great"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,It helped me organized a very difficult kitchen draw.,The Lipper Beechwood Expandable Flatware/Cutlery Tray was a great addition to my kitchen. I had a silverware draw that I was having difficulties organizing. The Lipper Beechwood Expandable Flatware/Cutlery Tray allowed me to organize my silverware draw and keep it that way. I am very happy with it since I have tried several other items and they worked for a short time but not for the long run.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,"Aughhhh, competely useless!","I have always wanted one of these and finally wasted my money and bought one.  More pressure is needed to hold this device on the lid of a jar than it would take just to open the jar in the first place.  If you are buying this because of small hands or weak grip, don't bother.  My husband can make it work, but by the time he is in the kitchen he can just open the jar for me.  The teeth to hold the lid are shallow and slip off the jar if you don't apply enough downward pressure.  I have never been so disappointed in a kitchen gadget"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Service beyond all expectations,Product is just what I wanted and the price was the best I've seen in years.  Chipped oven was replace immediately without question.

kitchen & housewares,22 of 22,5.0,Top Notch Thermometer,"All you could want in a probe thermometer.  The probe responds almost instantly to temperature change and is more accurate than any of the other probe thermometers I've tried.

I've also used it many times in the grill with no problem"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,"OK, but not great","This does the job fine, but if I had it to do over again, I would have gotten an all stainless one.  Not being able to put this in the dishwasher is a huge drawback.  My two favorite words are ""dishwasher safe,"" but to not be able to put something that touches raw poultry in the diswasher is insult to injury.  I am pricing others and it looks like I'll be dropping at least $18"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Wonder-ful Skillet!,I added this to my growing collection of cast iron cookware! I use this all the time for making sandwiches or eggs! It is lightweight because it is so small and cooks everything beautifully! (Cast iron anything cooks great!) It cleans easily too. I keep it out on my stove because I use it so much! I highly recommend this wonderful little skillet
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Positive,"The upright deep cleaner is lightweight, so very easy to use and excellent at cleaning my carpets.   It is for those very reasons I find that I am using it more often than I ever thought that I would.  I absolutely love it"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Origami reinvented as a bookshelf.,"I own this bookshelf in a lighter stain, and it's great - I got it when I started grad school and it moved to several different apartments and across half the country with me.  It folds up and packs really easily, and was sturdy enough to hold tons of really heavy textbooks.  Can't beat that"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Like a T-Shirt,These sheets are nice and soft like a favorite t-shirt. They wash well and fit the mattress tightly so they don't come off with movement. I would recommend it for colder months of the year when you want more warmth
kitchen & housewares,30 of 30,1.0,"Great idea,  difficult to clean","I loved this product at first. It tenderizes the toughest meats fast. Makes marinades absorb even better. BUT- it rusted after washing in the dishwasher. Also- the flat part that pounds the meat-lost it's spring action. Also, meat juices got trapped on the inside, causing me concern when using with raw pork and chicken. Great concept- not perfected yet"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,No cracking here!,"I have had this for a year and use it more days than not.  No cracking.  It works great, but I will say it is harder to use in bigger apples.  Perhaps that is why others had cracking problems, but I am only speculating.  "
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,No better value for the money,"I'll start by admitting that I'm a Wusthof fan. As far as my knives go; even though I'll freely admit that the Calphalon Traditional series are an excellent value, my Wusthof Classic set is enough better to justify the price difference in my eyes. That loyalty stops fast when it comes to things like meat forks. Yes, the Wusthof is a little beefier, but the Calphalon is more than good enough for any conceivable home use at one-fifth the price. This fork is a pleasure to use for both carving and turning roasts and such. In fact, my only complaint is that at this time, they don't offer a curved fork as well (anyone listening out there?). If you are in the market for a fork like this, there is simply nothing else I've seen that even remotely approaches it for quality and value"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,All-CLAD? I think not.,This roasting pan is NOT a clad construction like the other All-Clad cookware. It is a pure stainless steel construction and does not conduct heat well at all.  I'm going to be returning mine as I just purchased a Viking Roasting Pan to replace this one. The Viking is only a little bit more expensive but it is a fully CLAD ALUMINUM construction and conducts heat SUPERBLY -- plus it matches my All-Clad cookware

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Useful, but not durable","I have tendonitis in my hands, and this makes opening jars a bit difficult at times. There isn't always someone else around to open them so we picked up the OXO jar opener to give me a hand. It's a funky thing, combining one of OXO's large, soft rubber Good Grips handles with a fan-shaped piece of plastic that grips the edges of a jar lid in metal teeth, grasping it and giving you leverage with which to twist.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,4.0,Almost!,"Really great butter dish, but in the Seattle area it seems like most of the butter in the grocery stores aren't the long sticks, but instead are shorter and wider, like a squished-square shape. When I put one of these sticks in the butter dish, the top of the butter gets squished onto the inside of the top of the dish. Though I have found the long, &quot;normal&quot; sticks of butter here, they're not very common. Maybe I should move back to the east coast so my butter will fit in my nice butter dish :"

I expected to hang them up just to look pretty since they are so attractive.  But after I used them for the first time, I was smitten.  They were perfectly shaped for my hand, perfectly balanced and light weight.  I now use them all the time and idiotically enjoy the chance to handle them while cooking.  It's the little things in life, they say.."

I then put it throught 4 years plus of using it five days a week, eight hours a day in an industral kitchen. The knife keeps a razor edge, easy to clean, and it's one of the best knives in the kitchen. If you own one kitchen knife, then this is the one you want. The Trident/Wsthof Grand Prix series is one of the best buys for your money, hands down beating hankels (which suck by the way). Consumers Report did an evaluation on kitchen knifes, and this knife was the #1 knife"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,A Happy Camper!," I bought this bed (twin size) for a camping trip and I was very apprehensive about sleeping on it because I'm not the type of person that can sleep on just any bed. I'm pretty good at tossing and turning in my own bed, at home. However, I was pleasantly surprised when, the first night that I slept on it, I closed my eyes and didn't wake up until morning. The bed didn't fight me at all. I was very comfortable and I was so rested and so pleased with the bed that I decided to write this review."

kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,perfect for what I bought it for!,I picked this up at Walmart about 3 or 4 years ago.  It was on sale for $29.99 (a one day Thanksgiving sale) & I purchased the buffet insert to go with it (also on sale for $19.99 or less).
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Pineapple Slicer,Fantastic.  I love fresh pineapple.  Now I can eat all I want with just a twist of a handle.  Easy clean up
kitchen & housewares,34 of 34,1.0,Not a Chinois,"This product is not a chinois, as the industry understands it.  It is a ""china cap,"" or to use a more PC description ""a cone strainer.""  I would submit that any serious chef would gawk at the price because they would find [$$$] to be a great deal, and should shop with that in mind.  The point is that you could strain a stock through this thousands of times and end up with a cloudy, unsilken sauce.  ...  Know your lingo, what you're willing to spend on what you want, and whether or not you really need it--pay the money for the real thing instead of a misnamed product.  .."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,warm fuzzy feeling,"Good Stuff. This is an outstanding piece of cookware that I picked up for $99 @ williams-sonoma. The lid is nice thick glass and the insert is high quality stainless steel. I use the steamer insert mostly to strain pasta, but I have steamed a few veggies in it. I primarily use it to cook pasta, because absolutely nothing sticks to the surface. You can leave it sitting on the stove overnight (important if you're cooking for a date) and not even dried, cheesy, crusty pasta will stick to it. All you have to do is blow on it and it comes right off. It's great."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Money well spent,"This little stick vacuum is perfect for exactly what it is meant to do, quick pick ups.  I charged it exactly as directions indicated and it's been great for picking up in the dining area after my little ones.  It's also great for a quick pick up on the stairs and entry rugs.  I like the versatility of having just a hand vac too"
kitchen & housewares,20 of 20,5.0,Why I Love This Opener,My wife and I find this to be the best can opener we have ever used; we even use it to open cans that have lift top lids (such as Del Monte canned sliced peaches).  Why this can opener is so good is because of how it works and the quality of the product.  It is made like a Swiss watch; there is no slop in the movement.
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,It does a decent job for the price tag it carries,"We use this daily and working great so far. Except cleaning effort, I would say this is a good juicer for the price tag it carries"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Can't go wrong!,"          I couldnt be happier with my Breville juicer. Never heard of Breville before. Almost bought a Jack Lalane juicer,until i saw the features of the Breville.Bigger wattage and faster rpm makes for faster juicing. There are times when i dont even have to use the plunger to push the fruit and veggies through. A little noisy,but no more than most small appliances i have had! Looks good sitting on top of the countertop.Very e-z clean-up. And $99 with free super saver shipping makes this a good value"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,So far so good!,"After 27 months of using an Evenflo cool mist humidifier, I purchased this model for my 27-month-old's room.  So far, I love it!  (But please note, I've only had it for 3 weeks)  The middle level is quieter than our previous humidifier's low level.  I've had no problems filling the tank, and found that it needs refilling every 2 to 3 nights, going 12 to 14 hours each night!  That's about the same, if not, a little better, than our other humidifier.  The filter seems to cost about as much as similar filters...and I haven't had to change mine yet, and it doesn't appear that it needs it anytime soon.  I plan on purchasing the same unit for our baby on-the-way! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great for certain applications,"It's not all that powerful, but I use it to mix my diet drinks--only one thing, the beater, to wash; and it travels extremely well; it also doesn't put too much air in the diet drink--a problem w/stronger blender.  I also use it to beat an egg for an omelet or scrambled eggs.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Nice product and it arrived in two days!! Yes, two days!","We ordered this Presto cooker/canner from Amazon on a Sunday and it arrived on Tuesday. That's great service. It item is very nice. We wanted to be sure we had a pressure *canner* and not just a pressure *cooker* so we ordered this one. It's really big and sturdy. This was my first canner and I thought it was easy enough to use and it seemed SAFE to use too. The instructions were easy to follow and all the items I canned (tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, garden green beans, and apples) turned out just like we remember them when my mom and my husband's mom did canning. My mother-in-law said she had to soak the gasket on her canner for a long time before using but the one I ordered didn't require that. I like my canner and so does my husband. It was a good investment"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,It pokes at you.,"My only problem was that the feathers really poke through to even the fitted sheet so that if you move, you will feel it.  I had to purchase a mattress pad so that I would not feel the feathers.  However, now that I have a pad on top of the feather bed, it really is like heaven to sleep on.  So very soft so I recommend as long as you purchase a mattress pad"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Pretty,Stylish,Scratches&Chips","To prevent scratches and chipping and to retain Fiesta's smooth glossy surface, hand wash separately, one piece at a time, in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates (cups between coffee filters).  I do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new. A friend gave me all her brown dripware (Gourmet) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched, pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing.  Mine from the same era are still glossy, mostly scratch free, and certainly not pitted. Also, I don't put my original pieces in my microwave, (only hers) because although it may be safe to do so, this can dull a glossy finish.  Re Fiestaware, I remember seeing relatives and neighbors Fiesta cups & plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and ""cheap""- looking, perhaps because of the dull rose, gray, and avacado colors at the time. However,I find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and,so far, have bought Heather,Seamist, Scarlett, Tangerine, Turquoise, and yellow. Cobalt, Cinnebar, and Plum are just too dark and dreary for me.  In the store, they are much darker than they look on here. In a library book on fiestaware, they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color (like the fruit) would be bright/pretty, too."
kitchen & housewares,33 of 35,2.0,"Pretty, sharp, but don't wash em'","They were great, until I washed them.  Now they have little brown spots all over them.  It looks like rust to me.  Since you kind of need to wash your knives now and again, I would say to avoid these.  Unless you're looking for a good, rusty knife, then they're the tops"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Attractive and useful casserole dish,"Cast iron usually isn't my first choice of cookware for several reasons: it isn't non-stick; it's heavy (I have tendonitis in my hands); and it can't go in the dishwasher. Thankfully, Lodge's new enamel-coated line takes care of most of these issues!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,These break in less than one year!,"I actually was stupid enough to buy this machine TWICE.  After the first one stopped sucking (only one year old) I wandered into Sears, looked at all the models, and concluded this one was the easiest to use again.  Then, THAT one broke after being used about six times.  Now, I am going to try the Hoover after reading the Amazon reviews.  Wish me luck :"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great Soup Pot...But A Bit Small,"Like i said, it is a great soup pot!  Simmers slowly on the stove all day long.  I cook for a family of four and i found it too small for most soup/stew recipies.  I would recommend the 7 1/4 soup pot or round french oven.  BTW, the red color is beautiful!!! Although the other colors are nice as well"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great knife for the money,"I chose these knives because (1) they are forged, and (2) they appeared to be the right balance between quality and price.  I suspect if I was a professional chef I would know the difference and buy the super expensive other brands, but for a recreational cook I find these knives to be supurb.  The price is right, the balance and heft is great, and they hold a fine edge.  I usually run them through a hand sharpener before I use them, and they are always razor sharp.  To restore edges (I haven't had to do that yet with these knives) I use the ""scary sharp"" sandpaper on glass method. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nissan Multi Function can insulator,My Husband and I love the two we bought.  They definitely keep the can cold for at least 45 minutes to an hour.  They also fit into a koolie to keep them cooler and help them kind of float in the water.  We are thinking about buying more to give as gifts
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Happy with Product,"I received this urn as a wedding gift last year. I don't know if I received one off a previous and better assembly line, but mine works great! No leaking, no loose screws. I've even told my guests who have loved it where to buy one. And, I've always received compliments on the great coffee! That's disappointing that others have received such poorly made ones -- I love mine"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Nice Small Vacuum,This little vacuum has great suction and picks up pet hair much better than the previous small vacuum we had.  It is used primarily on the carpeted stairs and to vacuum the floor of our cars.  The filter is easy to clean & you don't have to mess with a paper bag.  The built in hose attachment is easy to use and did a nice job on dust on the stairway banister. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,5.0,America's Test Kitchen says so...,"I don't know this stuff, other than my wife wants one.  I just checked America's Test Kitchen (the consumer reports of the kitchen), and they raved about the i-series oxo peeler, but the ""non-Y"" peeler (the more standard style with the blade in the same direction as the handle).  Specifically raved about the sharpness of the blade and overall balance."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,The Best Mixer!,I purchased this mixer a couple of months ago. I have used it several times and love how it works.  I had purchased the mixer based on Kitchen Aids reputation and on reviews submitted by others. I purchased the Artisan model over the larger model based on those reviews.  I am very pleased with the Artisan model so far. The reviews I read were right on the money. This mixer works as advertised. I would highly recommend purchasing the Artisan model Kitchen Aid Mixer
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Don't waste your money on this crap,"I got this ""mandoline"" recently and so far i have used it to slice vegie. I can't say it doesn't do the job, but then again I could probably have done it faster and better using a kitchen knife. The blade started having some rust right after the first use, although I wiped it clean after washing it. The finger protector is a joke; it does not hold the food in place and snaps off very easily. After using it a few times I decided I would rather do the job with a kitchen knife than risk injuring myself. Don't waste your money on this. Instead, invest it in a more professional mandoline"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 20,5.0,The criper made for pros,"We use our Chicago Metallic pizza crisper because it does the best job heating frozen pizzas, or reheating restaurant pizzas. But we don't limit this to pizza. It is ideal for warming rolls in the oven, reheating danish  pastries and for crisping any other type of bread product. We also use this  for Mexican food dinners, it's especially handy for making crispy nachos  and for reheating tortillas. I am familiar with the products from Chicago  Metallic from using them in restaurant cooking so I thought they should be  used as home as well, and I was right.  After all, the company that makes  all the pizza pans for Pizza Hut worldwide, must know something about pizza  baking.  Besides, I'm glad to support one of the few remaining U.S.  manufacturers of bakeware"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Junk,"As everyone else has stated, this non-stick is very sticky.  Gilled tortillas on one side, fajitas on the other.  Both stuck.  It's almost as if they friggin BONDED to the material.  The most disturbing part - when cleaning, I used a NYLON brush.  The NYLON brush started removing the finish. And the stuck-on food still wasn't coming off.  It looks like I'm going to have to throw this thing away and buy one from a better manufacturer"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,No Buttery slips!,This butter dish is great because of the little top knot.  It's very easy to pick up the lid.  Besides....it's cute
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Broke after one month....,"It worked fine for one month (we were using it twice a day), but then the handle would not stay down when we tried to use it.  We can still use the toaster, but we have to hold the handle down ourselves and have to determine when to shut it off."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Fab starter set!  A great addition to any kitchen,"I read the reviews, ordered and am glad I did.  This did not dissapoint me and now after hearing all the stuff on the news about danger with teflon coated pots and pans, I realize I made a good choice to get this classic stainless steel and do away with my teflon junk.  These are great and I purchased more pieces and they really DO clean up easily, it surprised me, I thought it was hype, but No, they do actually wipe clean and even stuff that appears stuck on, just soak momentarily and it wipes off.  If you hate cleaning and scraping and spending lots of time, then this is the set you want. Cuisinart Chef's sets are very nice looking and maintain that look even after repeated washings. Indeed you do only need to keep it at medium heat since they conduct the heat very well and no need to turn up to high.  for the price here on amazon, its a major bargain"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Henckels Santoku Knife,"I love this knife.  It's the best kitchen knife I've ever owned.  I ordered the 4 star version because I like this style of handle the best.  The high carbon stainless steel blade is very sharp and holds an edge a long time.  It took me a few days, and a few band-aids, before I got used to how sharp it was.  I plan on ordering more of the 4 star series"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,"Chantal 48-Ounce Tea Steep, Red",This is a great product and the color makes it elegant
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent buy - great pan,I've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning.  We've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water!  It's a great saucepan and the price was great.  Highly recommended
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,1.0,Don't buy appliances from Amazon!!!!!!,"Goodbye to buying on Amazon, atleast appliances or electronics! Buy from anyone with a better policy for higher cost items. Amazon is using their wonderful 30 day return policy [may be fine for books] but not for an $800 espresso machine! Within 6 months, the Kitchenaid ""on"" button broke - not a great sign for quality. Though Kitchenaid will exchange it, we don't see this as Kitchenaid's best product. Most stores would credit you, but not Amazon. We've spent alot of money with these guys, but not now"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Absolutely love it!,"This certainly beats any of the silicone jar openers I've tried.  It is really easy to use and looks nice also.    It has several size &quot;grabbers&quot; to choose from depending on the size of the lid.  It does take up a fair amount of drawer space, but well worth it"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,Waste of money,"Oxo usually designs their products so thoughtfully, I was willing to pay a little extra for this baster.  For $10, I expected this to be a high-quality product, but it was a total disappointment.  First, the hole at the tip is so large, the liquid runs out without even sqeezing the bulb.  Then the plastic peice that cradles the bulb kept falling down into the pan juices.  I'm not even sure what function it serves.  It's mediocre at best, and everyone would be wise to buy something else"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Gorgeous platter!,"I have almost the entire set of Summer Breeze dishes and accessories, and I love pretty much every piece.  This platter is beautiful and goes perfectly with the rest of the set.  It washes easily in the dishwasher.  Overall I give it 5 stars, gorgeous and sturdy"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Farberware pasta cooker and strainer,"This cooker strainer is top quality.  We have had other cookers and always had problems with opening and closing the lid which required twisting and turning.  Farberware has a unique design that elimintes the locking of the lid by twisting and turning it. Some one at Farberware was thinking ""outside the  box"" by designing the handles so that they lock the lid securely. Simple,easy,perfect."
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Flimsy,This can be described in one word...'Flimsy'
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Fabulous Ice Cream Maker,"I bought this ice cream maker for my son, who is a chef. We also bought the extra bowl and recipe book.  He was so very happy with the gift.  Also he was excited that we  bought an extra bowl. Since his birthday, he has been experimenting with the different recipes."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Presto 0880 Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener,Sharpened every knife in the house and it worked flawlessly.  Great Product at a great price
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,This pan is the best!!,"I ordered this pan after having crepes at a resturaunt. I researched and almost ordered the other one that you turn upside in the batter. But opted for this one at $10. So I ordered it. It arrived in a few days. I just tried it this morning. I have not recieved my crepe recipe book, so I searched on line for a basic crepe recipe. It was so easy! They didn't stick and they were bigger then the resturaunts! I filled them with strawberries sweetened with splenda, and bananas. Then fat free whipped cream and more straberries and banans. I drizzeled with a little chocolate syrup for looks. My 12 year old loved them!! But, we could only eat one each!! You won't regret this purchase!!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Shellfish Tools!!,These are pretty handy tools for getting every last bit of  crab out of tight places.  The cushy handles are comfortable and easy to use.   Each side has a different sized scooper to use with a variety of differently sized shellfish. Highly recommended
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"My first ""real"" dishes",For my 2nd apartment I decided to get real dishes instead of the hodge-podge I had from dorms and thrift stores. I could not be happier w/these dishes. The price was reasonable and they are incredibly durable.  I really like the plum-it's a rich purple and it was easy to match it to other fiestaware.  I liked the color so much I got the mugs and 2 other kinds of bowls to match the dishes. It was a great deal and it will be easy to add to my kitchen set. 
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Rock Solid  Workhorse,"I did considerable research before I ordered the Bunn grinder.  I knew I was not about to spend $200 plus for a grinder to make primarily drip coffee so my selection choices were limited.  I decided on the Bunn and it has been everything I expected.  It is not too large or too tall.  It's heavy enough that it does not jiggle or move when grinding.  And, best of all, it produces even, consistent grinds with no mess of coffee grounds or dust left around it on the cabinet.  With the three year warranty, you can't go wrong"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Own Three - Love Them!,"This lightweight, powerful fan is a great addition to my office space.  The temperature in our space is inconsistent, so I purchased my first Holmes Blizzard Table Fan a couple of years ago.  It has been so effective, that two other people in the department wanted one.  I bought two more recently and they are just as good.  I highly recommend them as it has consistently worked well with low noise levels, rotates well, and keeps the space quite cool. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,A good value,"This grinder performs very well for the prices it's been selling for. When I saw this one, it was clear I had been looking at other units that were to high in price for a home unit and for my needs. I'm getting the same grind quality seen from a professional unit at the market. Granted it is not fast, but it's fine for me. You almost never see a grinder at any price with 3 coarsness disks. Unfortunately the disks are not stainless steel, but units costing $499.00 often don't have stainless either. Also, this grinder has a reverse feature which you rarely see at any price."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect 5 cup dish,As usual pyrex has come up with another great product.  Definitely recommend...
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Great price, great product.","I bought this item as a gift.  Although I can't comment on the durability capability, I was very surprised with the quality of the board.  It is very nice looking, something you could keep out on your counter all the time and it looks sturdy and durable.  Excellent size too!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for quality and affordability"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,It's not 12 inches,"This item is actually 11 and 3/8 inches in diameter, not 12 inches.  Measure your frying pan before you order this"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Nice value,"What started as a little spurge to make my kitchen counter look more updated ended up as a good bargain.  For $10, this canister looks great, and does a good job.  It is weighted on the bottom so it avoids tipping over.  It also cleans easily with Windex.  A really nice, functional accent for a kitchen. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Awesome,"I bought this fish turner for my step-dad who is a commercial fishman.  He loved it, and uses it almost every day.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who cooks fish often"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,2.0,I expected more,"I own a bunch of calphalon cookware with no complaints except for this one.  Its poorly designed because the handle is so heavy, the pan tips over to the side and will not sit flat.  Because this happens food is unevenly cooked"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Awesome Bread Baker,"I haven't tried traditional French bread in this yet, but I made my first loaf of sourdough in it the other day and it was absolutely beautiful. Usually my sourdough turns out kind of flat, and I have to spray water in the oven every few minutes to get a good crust. This was so much easier and the crust was even better than I was expecting. Now I want to get the LaCloche (round) version and see what I can bake with it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,taste like plastic,cleaned pot sveral times- after a few brews it taste like plasic.. i had a previous model and it was great -this is going to be thown out. I am glad it was only $2
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Good Quality Sheets,"This set was also bought for a friend. Warm and cozy, price was excellent!"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Small but satisfactory,"This is my second Pur Ultimate, the other was larger, but the other also developed a minute leak at the bottom seam.  I see that others who had purchased the larger PUR pitcher complained of the same problems.  I am hoping that this smaller unit which holds less water may experience less stress and will rightfully earn the 5 stars I am giving it.  The main reason I am giving 5 stars is because of the filter involved, it is not simply a taste filter, it is certified as the only filter that removes the microbiological cysts Cryptosporidium and Giardi."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,2.0,Okay for a while...,"This worked really well when I first got it, but it seems as though it gets harder and harder to use as time goes by, almost as if it's wearing out.  And it's not when you insert the corkscrew into the wine, it's when you try to pull the cork out - it's almost impossible now.  So, bottom line is - it will work for maybe a year or two but then you'll need another, which to me isn't acceptable for the price I paid"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,2.0,Good while it lasted,Worked great for grilling fish and meat - not so good for chicken. Died soon after the 1 year warranty expired
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,2.0,Clearly These Should Be Packaged Differently To Ship,"It was quite disappointing to receive the items broken. Looking at the way this package was shipped, clearly the packaging would NOT protect this item from damage. This method of packaging breakables should clearly be changed. Especially since, my order was not the only one to arrive broken. Disappointing! The crumbs looked like the bowls could have been nice"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Nice product,This is a useful combination of steamer and pasta pot.  My only complaint is that the diameter and depth of the main pot should be increased.  With the present dimensions one can only cook one pound of pasta at a time and have an adequate volume of water when the pasta insert is being used.  It's great for steaming vegetables
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,It's Not Stoneware,"I ordered 3 of these.  The price is good, but the description is deceiving.  These are a melamie type product, not the stoneware like the dishes.  I have placed some very hot items on the trivet, just to see if it will damage it & it held up well"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 32,1.0,Must be handwashed.  ,The rims on the pot and the lid cover is too sharp.  It must be handwashed because it cut the coating on my new dishwasher.  Just horrible.  Poor design
kitchen & housewares,16 of 18,4.0,Pretty good,"I have a 1.5 qt no-name crockpot that I bought from Walgreen. I use it mostly to cook single-serving hot cereals overnight so I have ready-to-serve breakfast right out of bed. This device has 3 temperature settings from A to C, which A being the lowest and C being the highest. With my crock, the default A setting seems fine. However the warm setting is a bit too hot for me as it continue to cook the food and result in overcooking if I over-sleep a couple of hours over the weekend"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"Cold office, warm hands","I love this heater. It's extremely quiet. It has to be, since it sits on my desk facing the left side of my keyboard, keeping my hands nice and warm. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,Poor packaging,"This item was not packaged well at all and it arrived broken.  It was supposed to be a gift so I didn't have time to wait for Amazon to send a new one.  I had to buy something else and Amazon refused to give me a refund, but only gave me credit.  I really like the glasses themselves, but I would be careful purchasing glassware from Amazon if you have time limitations"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,okay,Initially the pillow was at a perfect firmness it has been a couple of months and it seems to be loosing its firmness. The ruffling noise it makes is not an issue I just wish it would keep its shape. Regardless of the price one pays for a good pillow they don't seem to last. Kind of sounds like life in a nutshell! Sadly as with life firmness and longivity are the first to go in time our mind will and then all will be perfect maybe that is when I will try to find the perfect pillow
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Italian styling doesn't matter in the end,Previous reviewers were right: the plastic smell is intense and does not go away. Too bad
kitchen & housewares,22 of 23,5.0,Maybe the best cooks tools ever,"I can find nothing to take to task on the All-Clad tools.  I have nearly all the tools they make and I like them all.  They are easy to clean, no nooks for stuff to get stuck.  They fit well in the hand and have a substantial, but not heavy, feel to them.  Their shape is very good for the task at hand.  The sole negative is their price but when balanced against the good, including the fact that they should last longer than the cook, they are a bargain at the price"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,"Nice Cookware, is anyone reading the directions??","This is great cookware, I am wondering if anyone is actually reading all the directions???"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Excellent bread machine,"I hadn't had a bread machine in many years and remember the quirky nature of my old machine. Bread machines have come a long way, and this Breadman is an excellent choice. I have seen a couple reviews in which it was stated that the machine didn't mix the dough well enough. I found that some of the recipes that came with the machine didn't seem to me to contain enough liquid. That may be the problem. But the instructions for this machine, as with all machines, state that you do need to check your dough at the beep and make sure it is the right texture and that it is well mixed. Flours can vary a lot throughout the seasons"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Made in USA,"Can you believe it - made in Canton, Ohio instead of China.  I owned one of the $300 top of the line Hoovers purchased from a department store.  Twice the upper clear acrylic tank had to be replaced - $55 a piece and then the bottom clear tank would not seal and the motor was going out according to the vacum shop mechanic.  After reading many reviews of the top of the line models, I concluded that they are prone to break down and basically cheaply constructed.  I asked the vacum store guy about it and he said that the expensive models in the department stores are made in China out of Chinese parts and he considered them junk.  He recommended this basic model by Hoover which he claimed is rock solid, made of heavy duty parts in Canton, Ohio.  The tanks are an opaque polymer which he said you can bounce on the floor and they won't leak.  When I got it, the first thing I did was look at the label.  Sure enough - ""Made in the USA"".  Amazing.  Cleans great.  As far as the rinse feature on higher models, it means another tank and fittings and one more thing to go wrong.  You control the exact amount of detergent being used - low tech but accurate and dependable.  Since the directions said to let it dry before running a rinse I don't rinse anymore anyway."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love this bowl,I ordered a 12 piece place setting and a couple of the extra pieces in the cinnabar color.  I haven't received the dishes yet only this bowl but it is perfect!  I just spent a fortune on linens for my kitchen in a cranberry and tan plaid and this matches sooooo perfect.  I will be using this bowl as a serving bowl rather than a mixing bowl.  Can't wait for the rest of my items to come
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,awesome item,but you can buy it at walmart for $9.99 with no s&h fees either.. :
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"good for humans, too!","My two rat terriers like the Snuggle Safe heating pad, though it's hard to catch them in the act because if I'm around, they snuggle with me, instead! :-)"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 15,2.0,I WAS surprised.....,"I was in need for a cheap mixer, for thanks giving, this is the exact model that I got from target. I was surprised what this mixer could do, for only being 125 watts. It did handle great too. I was mixing a big batch of oatmeal cookies for my big 14 people feast, when the motor died. I started out smoothly, trying not to put too much pressure on the already struggling motor. I dont know what I did, but the mixer kept slowing down slower and slower untill it rest at a real slow speed,where the beaters almost weren't moving, and I could tell that the motor was burning, for my hand on the handle could feel the heat. I could also feel the sputtering of the motor. I unplugged it, and plugged it back in, even though it was still burning, and tried again. The beaters still looked as if they weren't moving. Then there was a POP! Smoke and a horrid smell were coming through the front vents. I was mad that I couldn't finish the cookies, yet at the same time, I feel bad that everything I do breaks something :(  I guess I shouldn't expect cheap stuff to do heavy jobs"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love this pan!,"I love making bundt cake (and eating it too).  This pan has such a lovely, intricate design.  It browns evenly, and comes out very easily as well.  I'm quite pleased"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,2.0,Cleans well but built on the cheap,I cannot express my disappointment with this unit and with Hoover.  
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,It's beautiful and lasts and lasts and lasts,"I've had mine for over 2 years now and it's the only kettle that's lasted that long. It's beautiful to look at, I've never had a problem with the spout. I use it every day, twice a day- once in the morning for my green tea and once at night for my mint tea. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because my heart's desire for tea kettle is a totally glass one - of which I've had three and they all broke."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Best Yet,"I bought this item at a sale in Texas and stuck it in a drawer and forgot about it until I needed to bake my Holiday pies. I attempted to roll out the dough the usual way to save time and I just about threw the whole mess out, everything was sticking to my board. Then I remembered the Pastry Cloth and pulled it out. I put it together and was on my way. The dough rolled out perfectly!! The trick is be sure you flour it well before using. I will use it always. I'm even ordering an extra  Love it!!!"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Far and away the best and easiest popcorn!,"For years, I used an air popper -- but would have never bought it had I known about the wonderful Whirley Pop. It is light and easy to lift, and pops the world's best popcorn, WITHOUT ANY UNPOPPED KERNELS!  Although best with coconut or peanut oil, plain old canola oil does just fine.  Also, if I add salted butter to the pan with the oil and popcorn, I don't even need any salt -- and need A LOT less butter than I did with the air popper.  Also, with the air popper I always had many unpopped kernels, and, no matter how careful I was, had popcorn all over the kitchen.  No such problems with this ... It is WONDERFUL in all respects.  HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Not Made of One Piece,"I received these measuring cups, and they are not stamped out of one piece. The handles are bolted on, just as in any set of measuring cups"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Fagor 3 in one stainless steel cookware set,I am very pleased with this set. The quality is beautiful and it is a wonderful addition to my other cookware.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great knife,"Very sharp blade and comfortable handle.  Excellent quality for the money.  Only possible drawback is the box indicates it is not recommended for lefties.  My wife, a lefty, says she has no problem slicing but has cut her fingers several times while chopping.  I, a righty, have no such problems.  Well worth the purchase price but be aware if you are, or you're buying the knife for, a lefty"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Omelette Plates for the G5,"I have found these new plates to work very well. I have created many different kinds of omelettes, all of which have turned out to be delicious. The only problem I've had is using too much egg."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Black & Decker CJ525 CitrusMate Plus Citrus Juicer,"I have tried other juicers in this price range ($20-$30) all of which have been useless.  Finally a product has been designed by someone who has used the others also!  The B&D juicer's motor is strong enough to zip through my oranges and tangelos within 5 minutes to give me 2qts of juice.  I like how I can select how much pulp I want in my juice.  It really works too.  The beauty,though, is how easy it is to clean.  The parts disconnect easily for a quick rinse and you're done!  Good job B&D. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Dont buy this item,Please read all the reviews and then just go to Dairy Queen and have a gerat Soft Ice Cream and keep the $50 dollars in you packet!
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,What a handy little pan!,"This is such a handy little pan! It's just the right size for melting butter, warming syrup, or keeping basting sauce hot on the grill when you cook out. And cast iron can't be beat for durability and ease of cleaning"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,2.0,Pretty but ....,I thought this was a great idea for a gift but I was wrong. It turns out all though the Pitcher is pretty it cracked when it was used for hot tea. If the Pitcher is not made for such use it should be stated in the product description on the box it comes in or anywhere so the user is aware of the possibility
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Foodsaver Jar Sealer,"I have had the large mouth sealer for some time and finally decided to get the regular size.  It works great !!  Too bad it isn't included in the starter packs with the other one. Use it to keep popcorn, any dry mixes, opened jars of olives, pickles, small amounts of leftovers, cheese, canned veggies, etc. fresher, longer.  Saves on using so many bags, too"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Great to cook with and easy to clean,This gets 5 stars because it is perfectly shaped and not too heavy. It cooks even and leaves lines on the food. It also holds the food higher than the grease that might have dropped off your food. I just spray it with a light coating of Pam and then heat and cook. Clean up is easy because it is a heavy duty non-stick coating that is inside the pan and not just sprayed on. It wipes up with soap and hot water and a wash rag. You can fit 4 hamburger patties on it at one time if you want to do some inside grilling.
kitchen & housewares,8 of 10,5.0,Works fine as backup - not without problems,"We got this to replace a burner bought off the shelf. It died within the first week.  I have been much happier with the results for this burner as a replacement for our dead stove.  In fact, it heats up faster that our stove used to. Produces good heat quickly and has worked well in almost all situations."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Indispensible Bakeware,"The Pyrex Oval Roaster is a useful for all types of baking needs.  Several years ago I had broken my pyrex after years of use, without it in my kitchen I felt lost."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,I've been using this pan for 15 years.,"This has been my favorite pan for 15 years, and my wife and I both cook a lot.  About 10 years ago we got tired of handwashing things, so we've been putting these in the dishwasher since then."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Coffeehouse owner loves this french press,"I love this french press. When at home and away from our commercial espresso machine and brewers, we have tried a variety of brewing methods and usually opt for the french press. We have owned quite a few french presses but none have been so well constructed and handsome as this. It is worth the extra bucks; we plan to purchase more for gifts this Christmas."
kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,5.0,"Cameo Cleaner, great product...fast service","We have used this product for several years.  We bought a set of waterless cookware a few years ago and I was advised to use Cameo Aluminum & Stainless Cleaner on our new cookware.  The cookware company provided us with our first container of Cameo.  WOW...it made cleanup a breeze.  We now use Cameo on a lot of things.  About a month ago I went to the supermarket to buy more Cameo and they said they had quit carrying it.  I went to Amazon.com and did a search for Cameo...I wasn't surprised to find it...I have come to the conclusion that you can get about anything you need from Amazon. A friend of mine who cleans houses uses this product also, so we ordered about 16 containers of the Aluminum & Stainless Steel cleaner.  We also ordered 2 of their Cameo Copper, Brass and Porcelain Cleaner which neither of us had used before. Our order came from Gristedes Supermarket of New York, but it was ordered through Amazon.  My order came within a few days.  I just want to say thank you Amazon and thank you Gristedes Supermarket of New York. I hope you will continue to carry Cameo because I know that I will be needing more"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,No More Rug Doctor,"After years of renting Rug Doctors, we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner.  We were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off-white carpets when they come in from playing.  Also one of them is a puppy, who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times.   After reading other reviews, we selected the Hoover F5914-900.  We wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the Hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner.  The carpets are as clean as with a bigger Rug Doctor.  We have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time.  We are very happy with our Hoover.  It is fairly light, easy to fill and empty, and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes.  As other people have commented, the attachment hose tends to fall off, so we just leave it off.   Otherwise, it's a heck of a deal!  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Good slicer too, but...","After reading the reviews here, I wasn't sure if it sliced onions well. I am happy to say that the onions are sliced nicely. I was using a mandolin and throwing away too much, to prevent hurting myself. This is much quicker and safer. I also tried bell peppers, but the results weren't as good. Some of the peppers were mushed and some were huge slices. I had to get out the knife anyway and fix the large pieces manually."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,The Cuisinart Duet Blender/Food Processor is a winner.,I received the Cuisinart Blender/Food Processor about a month ago and just love it. It tackles the most difficult jobs easily and when compared to similar products that I have owned in the past it is the most heavy duty and well made. I am certain that this product will be able to handle any job efficiently and I won't be dissappointed like I have been in the past with other inferior products. The stainless steel exterior goes well with my other stainless kitchen appliances. I highly recommend the Cuisinart Blender/Food Processor and the Amazon.com website
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best vacuum I've owned in 31 years,"I carefully researched this vacuum and read all the reviews.  I absolutely love it (as much as you can love a vacuum cleaner).  I have a cat that sheds alot and live in an area thats pretty breezy all the time which generates lots of dust, so the bag filled up pretty quickly at first.  Never realized how much dirt was deep down in my carpets.  And of course, everytime I vacuum it raises the nap...almost like a new carpet every time."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,No good for espresso,"The machine does make a consistent grind without heating up the coffee, but it does not produce a fine enough grind for making espresso, even at the finest setting. You know how finely ground coffee stains the fingers? The coffee grounds from this grinder do not leave a trace. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Good oven for the price,Pro:  Excellent cooker.  Prepared food tastes great from oven.  Great product support from vendor after burning food onto bottom of oven.
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,don't buy this,"totally lame.  uneven toasting on only 1 side.  you have to stand next to it and watch or everything will burn,  a loser of a produc"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,5.0,This Baby Is Incredible!!,"I would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone! It is stylish, sleek,easy to clean, and has plenty of power to handle anything. I feel sorry for michigan, mix 3 apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink! Awesome! Awesome The first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol' prune who wouldn't be happy with anything! Get it now!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 8,5.0,Buy this pan!,"After finishing the best turkey I have ever made for Thanksgiving, I cannot highly recommend this pan!  An investment for sure, I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift.  At first I was hesitent about cooking on stainless steel.  My Mom has a set of some cheepy brand of stainless steel that she got in 1971 as a wedding gift (still has them) and they are a pain to cook on, everything sticks.  Not in these pans!  The majority of the time they wash right up.  Sometimes you might have to use a little Barkeepers Friend on them to keep them sparkling, but it takes two seconds to clean with that.  When we got married I had started with Calphalon.  I am definately switching to All Clad!!!  Much more simpler"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"So far so good, and my house smells much better","Clem is a mild mannered (let's say wimpy) 3 yr. old neutered male cat, one of five of my rescued kitties. But it was he who was spraying, in the worst of places, mostly on my kitchen counters, stove top, appliances, etc. I had only caught him marking once, but I knew he was the guilty one. He is such a sweet loving boy otherwise, gets along fine with the others, but I was at my wit's end, having gone through gallons of Natures' Miracle and still finding urine. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Easy Street,"WOW! I have owned a couple of different smaller models over the years and this is by far the best. The worst I ever owned did not have a removable inner pot and therefore it was a nuisance to clean, so be sure you do not get one of those. The pot in this comes out for easy cleanup. My favorite thing to do is prepare some chili or a stew the night before by adding the ingredients to the pot and then placing it in the fridge until the next morning at which time I put it in the cooker, turn on the slow setting and head out the door to work. Guess what...dinner is ready when you walk in the door and it doesn't get any better than that. The appliance will switch to a low warm setting so you do not have to worry about burning the house down. Oh what will they think of next? I LOVE IT!!!"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Its like being in Paris,"I got this machine 2 years ago as a gift and to this day its been the best gift I have ever received.  I really got hooked on drinking grand caf while spending ten days in Paris.  I was so used to watered down Mr. Coffee style coffee every morning and when I came back to the US, I couldn't stand it, I needed the French grand caf.  "
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Too cute!,"These sheets are adorable, and they were a great price!  I'm not sure how well they will wash and wear, but they will be perfect for my guest bedroom. "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Easy, easy, easy, and more reliable than an electric box","After both my LitterMaid electric self-cleaning cat boxes quit working within a few months of purchase, I went looking for other, more reliable options. We have four cats, and I do NOT want to have to do all that scooping every day. Fortunately, I found this Omega Paw box."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Handy little bug,"I purchased one of these for my elderly mother.  It is very easy to use and works just as advertised!  The only problem we have had with it so far is once, when she tried to use it on a can with a dented rim.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting an electric can opener"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent Coffee and really hot,This is the 3rd Farberware Coffee Maker we've had in 34 years. This one is the best yet. Coffee is hot and stays hot until the unit turns off automatically.  Its a real convenience to remove the coffee pot and pour coffee without being attached by the electric cord. I've always insisted that perculated coffee is the way to go if you love coffee.  This unit proves my case
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,The best starter piece,"If you can only afford one pan of All-Clad Stainless, this is the one to get.  It's wide enough (8 inches) to function as a small saute pan (ample one-dish meals for one or two, or a few scambled eggs) and deep enough to function as a small soup pot, or even fulfill its original function as a saucepan (veggies, pasta, etc.)  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Don't buy this,For a silicone spatula it is not   heat-resistant.  The first time I used it the edges cracked.  Plus it is not flexible so you can only use it at certain angles.  Waste of money...I sold it in my garage sale!
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great deal!,Sure is nice getting all the dirty clothes out of sight in the laundry room!  So much so that sometimes I forget to do the laundry!  ;-
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,LOUSEY!!!  Truly awful.,"This thing is totally useless.  You could roll it over a lime leaf or basil for 10 minutes and not even  make one slice.  It really does merely ""bruise"" your herbs!  I find it very hard to believe that OXO tried using this in a test kitchen before marketing it.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Compare With Other Stoneware...,"If you already own the Sango Splash dinnerware set and are interested in purchasing a couple of baking pieces you can't go wrong with the Square Baker, Lasagna, Casserole or Au Gratin pieces in this line.  Not only do these pieces coordinate with the Splash pattern but they can go from oven (500 degrees) or microwave, to tabletop, into the fridge with the leftovers, and then on to the dishwasher.  These pieces offer versatility and style at a great price.  Genuine value"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Beautiful Spode goodness,"I bought these for my wife to add to her collection. I got them on a one-day special. What a great deal! These are a perfect size for potatoes, vegies, etc. to serve at Christmas"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,Neat little chopper,"Easy to wash, nice sharp blades. The blades are a little hard to clean safely when bits get caught, but mostly it just washes out in water. Chopping isn't that even but it does a good job if you keep shaking between the chopping. Does a great job with nuts and hard things, not quite so good with softer things (like bell pepper). Overall, well worth the cost"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Wide mouth jars are no match for this opener,Simply this item works.  It increases your leverage and the jars pop open.  I wasn't sure that I needed this item when I bought it but now that we have it it's used a lot.  The only minor problem with it is that the metal is pretty flexible if you do not have it lined up correctly with the lid.  Re-align and it works as advertised.  Good product.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I Love Pyrex,"I love the 4 cup measuring cup. I found this product is ususally not carried in the dept. stores, unlike the 1 cup and the 8 cup, they were everywhere! I do alot of baking and I use it everytime"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,SS Electric Skillet,I love the stainless steel electric skillet.  I'm happy with the cooking - it's easy to titrate the temperature as needed.  I especially love to set it to warm and serve from it at a party.  It is beautiful
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Great everyday skillet,"I switched to cast iron cookware a few months ago and have been in love with them. Since then I've bought the 12"" skillet, 10"" griddle and now the 10"" skillet. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I enjoy cooking again!,"I ordered this set of cookware a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely love it.  I had a set of Revere cookware but recently moved into a house with a glass top stove.  My revere cookware rocked and spun on the burners - it was not completely flat on the bottom.  The Cuisinart cookware stays put!  Everything cooks perfectly in it.  If you use it properly (i.e. do not use too high heat), it is virtually non-stick with just a spray of Pam or a little olive oil.  I had the Revere cookware ever since I got married (23 yrs. ago) and always liked it.  I hated to part with it.  However, I am glad I had to get new cookware because I love the Cuisinart"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Blade is a little shallow.,"This is another great product for a great price from KitchenAid. Very easy to clean, dishwasher safe, composite handle. It also has measurements which have come in more handy than I originally thought. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 8,5.0,Too heavy,"I purchased this dutch oven to be used in my home - we no longer go camping.  It was too heavy before I even mixed up a recipe so I did return it. If I were 20 years younger & a lot stronger, perhaps I would have kept it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great product and excellent price,"I ordered this product for my everyday use but when the product came it was an excellent quality and I decided to use it for special occasions. I specially love the size of dinner plate, bowl and the cups. It is an excellent buy for such a great price"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,shams,These are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully.  I am very pleased with my purchase! 
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,4.0,nice-looking teakettle,this is a very nice-looking teakettle.  It heats quickly - and holds the water hot for quite awhile.  It's fairly heavy in weight.  I would recommend this teakettle if you are looking for a good one that looks nice on your stove top
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Excellent machine,"I love this machine. Each package is its own brewing system. That means that there is nothing to clean, nothing to clog, and nothing to carry one flavor over to the other. I love strong coffee and I found even the House Brand to be full flavored. Most surprising is how good the teas taste. You actualy get the full flavor of brewed tea. The herbal teas are excellent and full of fruit flavor. The only disappointment was the hot chocolate: It was basically just as good as Swiss Miss. The frothing packages do work, but I get just as good if not better from skim milk and a $2 gizmo from IKEA. They are nice to keep on hand. The Milky Way froth does give a nice caramel flavor. The big down side is you can only get refills from Flavia. They have recently started giving free shipping on orders over $100, so stock up and get the free shipping. My big beef is that there is no window for the water resevoir: I have accidentially run out of water more than once. The machine does 'spit' at the end of the cycle so keep the brewer close to the cup"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Great for any home,"I've had experience with quite a few vacuums (kirby, dirt devil, generic pieces of crap, etc), and this one is the best so far.  Suction is great, it's powerful and does get to those corners well.  I actually like where the on/off button is, it's really easy for me to reach.  I've only had it about 2 months, but I have nothing but praises for it.  It's quite light, which is good for smaller folks like me who can't lift 100 ton vacuums.    Assembly instructions were easy and quick, and I feel like I could quickly and effectively change or fix the belt should it ever break or malfunction (which it hasn't so far).  Overall, it does a great job, just as good as any other bagged vaccuum, in my opinion.  I hope this review helps someone because the previous ones helped me to pick this product. Thanks"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,The Best Knife i've ever used!,"This knife takes an edge well, although it really dosen't need sharpening.  It has a good balance and weight, and is easy to clean and mantain.  This is an ideal knife for people ranging from Master cheif to Cullinary Arts Student.  A perfect gift for the cook in your famil"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,A touch of class for everyday,"OK, the kids are growing up and these add a touch of class to the dining table.  It is with great pleasure I retire the Ikea glasses.  They are a nice heavy glass with a unique cut to them.  I thought about the more traditional cut but am glad we got this one"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Good product for the price,"I use mine at least a few times a week, and it does a very good job with what it's built for. You definitely can't overload it with food or it will start leaking out the sides.  But the cleanup is easy, and it heats up and is ready to cook very fast. We've bought one for the office as well and everyone seems to enjoy how quick and easy it is"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Would have been 5 stars if I didn't have this problem...,"Got this product as a Christmas gift (2005).  Used it every morning for breakfast, no problems, for about a week.  I placed the removable parts in the dishwasher, top rack, a few times, like the instuctions noted.  I began to notice a strange thing."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Love the plates but they arrived scratched,I'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching.  My persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched.  I think next time I'll order them as individual place settings as they weren't packed well.  Amazon will give me a 20% discount for keeping them. 
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Buy ,It is not top of the line....but for the money it was a great buy.... would buy it again.
kitchen & housewares,30 of 30,4.0,"So far, so good -- and the oscillating is the best!","I decided to get this air cleaner after trying the Sharper Image Ionic Breeze and a larger Honeywell HEPA filter. At the time of purchase, the Sharper Image was the only one with a permanent filter. This was a big plus for me seeing as the older HEPA cleaners have 2 filters to replace, the larger one being nearly the price of the machine. This Honeywell tower has a permanent filter."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,fast and efficient,"I bought the Delonghi Electric Kettle after some friends returned from Europe singing the praises of electric kettles. My experience with it thus far is that it is very fast, shut off is a great convenience and it makes quick work of any task that involves heating water. I have an electric range and it takes forever to boil water on the stove top. I use the kettle to heat water for pasta and rice as well as tea."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,awsome cake pan,"this cake pan really bakes your cakes GREAT. if some one is thinking about buying this pan you should buy it. there was another customer that said that her cake did not bake very well , WELL let me tell you that it baked up GREAT"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,Great pancakes!,"If you're looking for an easy-to-use pancake mix that results in great pancakes here you go!  The pancakes are light, fluffy and easy to make.  Best with lots and lots of real maple syrup.  Beats other common brands like Aunt Jemima's, Bisquick, and Hungry Jack by miles!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Value!,"I got a T-Fal set when I first married. I've now been married twelve years.  In that time, I've tried another Calphalon set which I paid many times more for.  I now go back to my original T-Fal set.  It cooks better and the non-stick finish has held up better.  I guess you don't always get what you paid for.  I'm going to buy another T-Fal set soon.  It's much better than the Calphalon and much more affordable."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,What's for dinner?,"These cutting boards, with the three different colors to prevent cross-contamination of food, are terrific.  Having worked as a cook in health facilities, I am familiar with the problems of food poisoning and how easily it is spread.  These cutting boards really help to reduce the dangers of that in my home kitchen.  Their flexibility makes them easy to store when they are not in use and they are easy to wash and care for.  I wouldn't want to be without them"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,4.0,Ironing is a bore but steaming is much more fun,I received this as a christmas gift.  After 30 days of use I really love my steamer.  I can blast through an entire weeks worth of laundry in just a few hours while I watch television.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Performs As Expected...And More!,"I must say I was a bit skeptical about purchasing these Kitchen Shears...After all, they're definitely one of the cheaper if not cheapest pairs in terms of price that I've seen on Amazon.  However, never fear!  The scissors work like a charm.  I've used them with chicken and other meats with no complaints.  Recipe calls for chopped parsley?  I get out the scissors and ""snip, snip!""  The scissors come apart at the hinge so you can stick them in the dishwasher separately and ensure they are fully clean and bacteria-free.  "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,More problems with construction,"The reviews describing this device's construction problems are accurate.  I just had my grater break at the threaded shaft that connects the handle to the grating cylinder after maybe a dozen uses for grating parmesan.  Their stand mixers are the undisputed champs, but KitchenAid's hand graters are of a different and inadequate caliber.  Save the $20 and look elsewhere"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,Love It!,"This little machine is a blessing! I have 2 children and a dog and it cleans carpet like a breeze. The shampoo cartridge makes setup easy with no mess. With a flick of a switch you go from spraying the shampoo to a clean water rinse. One little complaint is that the recovery tank only holds about 1/2 of the water that fits into the water tank, so you have to empty the recovery tank more often than what you would have to fill the water tank. But they are super easy to empty and fill, so it's not that big of a deal. All in all it's a great product"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,4.0,good for wine,"The bottle stopper fits most openings, not all.  I've used it on 2 wine bottles so far, and it has kept the wine pretty fresh for at least 3 days, instead of one day with the plain recork.  Definition of ""fresh"" will depend on the wine drinker's palette. I purchased the bottle stoppers mainly for this purpose."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"For the price, nothing beats it","Ok, I've owned this timer for about 2 years now. My daughter dropped it, actually, let me rephrase that, THREW it on the floor numerous times from her highchair."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,DeLonghi BG 16 indoor grill,I bought this as a gift for my parents. They just love it. Mom commented on the construction. Now my Aunt wants one! The price was much cheaper than Williams-Sonoma and the delivery was quick and well packaged. Triple 
kitchen & housewares,9 of 14,1.0,What a mess!,"Fortunately this product was cheap because I am just going to throw it away.  It makes a big mess in the kitchen, spitting water and rice liquids all over the counter.  I only tried to make 2 cups (cooked) but it still just bubbled up and ran all over everything.  Maybe it was the sticky rice but I tried others and it did the same thing.  It is not worth the trouble to send back"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love them!!,These earthy-looking canisters are beautiful! I have  matching dinnerwear and accessories also.They look great on my brown quartz counter tops .An excellent purchase
kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,5.0,Simple as 1 2 3,They work flawlessly. 'Nuff said
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,A Wonderful Cooling Rack,"This is a great cooling rack for bakers or cooks. Its non-stick coating saves your baked goods from loosing their bottoms and clean up is a breeze (you don't spend lots of time scraping batter or grease out of the grid). The large size can accommodate breads or doughs or lots of cookies or muffins. The grid design also stops your baked goods from sagging through the bottom. I've also used it as a hot plate (but distribute the weight on the rack). It has a 15 year warranty on defects too. NOTE: it may be too big for some people's kitchens (measure your counter space first or be happy using it on the kitchen table). Overall, if you need a good cooling rack, definately spend your money on this"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Breaks very easily,The first shipment was in pieces. Returned and it was reshipped. The replacement order had a handle broken. I've given up and will try super glue.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,5.0,Great product,Very happy with the purchase - both in terms of price and product.
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Package of Six!,"I just received this item and have not used it yet, however I am giving it 4 stars because a) it is such a good idea and b) i am sure they will work fine because of the other silicon products I have in my kitchen.  They lose one star because they are thinner than what they appear to be in the photo.  I wanted to hurry this review before using the product because nowhere on this product description page did I read the words ""package of six"".  So I bought two of them, paying twice for what I only needed once.  Instead of returning the extra package I will send them to dear old mom.  Lucky her"

I use it for a lot of different things that need straining. Deep frying, boiling, even cheese making.It gets a lot of use in my kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,31 of 31,4.0,Delonghi Oven Review,"This is a terrific product.  It looks great and performs very well.  I have used the rotisserie with great success for turkey and roasts of all kinds.  I am also using the 'keep warm' feature to keep plates hot while I finish one last thing before I get the whole meal on the table.  Lastly, it is so great for holidays because you can bake a pie or other side and keep your regular oven working on the bird.  It heats up quickly and is very easy to use"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,cuisinart failure,"I purchased this item with great expectations.  It was defective, or maybe toast is supposed to brown on an intermittant basis.  Also, it is too small.  They say you can put up to 6 slices of toast in the oven, but it is IMPOSSIBLE.  Frozen pizza would also not fit.  All in all, this product is NOT worth the expense"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Great Juicer-Great Price,"I don't think you can find a better, easier to use citrus juicer at any price. It's gone up a couple of bucks since I bought mine, but it is still the best deal available without question."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Convenient idea!,"Simple idea. Replaces limp, wet pieces of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Protects the inside of the microwave from splatters and traps steam for easy cooking. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Excellent Bread at a Great Price,"I just got the BreadMan PRO TR-900S, and have made several loaves so far.  The machine is very well built, easy to clean, and the bread comes out better than that from the local bakery. I have not even used half of the functions yet, but I am looking forward to it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Beautiful dishes for the holidays,"These dishes are just gorgeous.  We use them not only for the holidays beginning at Thanksgiving, but all throughout the winter months as well.  They're just so pristine white that it reminds you of snow.  They're just so fitting with all your other decorations for the holidays and throughout winter as well.  However, they are typical Pfaltzgraff and do mar quite easily with knives and forks so be prepared to get out the cleanser to get off the black marks.  They come off with a little elbow grease and look like new.  Plus, the coffee cups with this set I just LOVE.  They're just the right size, not too big, not too small and fit in a lady's hand just perfectly"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Beautiful Table!!!,I have two of these tables. I absolutely love them. The color is fabulous and they look good with my Dolce Coffee Table

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,They Cut LikeThey Should,"Nice sharp edges, plenty of variation in size.  I'd replace them with the same product if I lost them.  Dropped a star because the sizes aren't stamped on each cutter.  Not that I don't have a ruler, but it would have been more convenient when a recipe calls for a specific diameter to be cut.  :"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Awesome bottle opener...,"This is a great bottle opener....strong, sturdy, and only $3.96 everyday at Walmart.  It'd do you good to pick it up there, rather than spend nearly $10 here. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Poor design,"In addition to the ""tippiness"" observed by the other reviewer, part of which is just a side effect of the otherwise-desirable saucier shape, the problem with this pan is that the aluminum disk is simply too small to make this a good pan for sauces, particularly if you are cooking with gas. No matter how small your flame, you get hot spots on the thin lower walls of the pan. Had I thought more about the design before purchasing I would definitely have bought the anodized aluminum version."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Thermometer,"I found this thermometer erratic and misleading.  It does not register the temperature quickly, and is not consistent.  It has been of no use to me"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Rabbit out hops them all!,"We have used any manner of wine bottle openers and corkscrews, even a poor copy of the Rabbit.  We are most pleased with Metrokane's Rabbit corkscrew.  It seem to be a never fail utensil and the kit is most complete with my favorite, an excellent foil cutter.  Thank you, Metrokane"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,cheaper elsewhere,"This same exact product is available in store at walmart, not online only like it is here, and it is only 23 dollars. Don't forget to shop around, Target.com likes to charge more than other places. The lack of stars is for the price listed here, not the product itself"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,mjbgo,This baking pan is wonderful.....got one last week for $9.99 and came back to get another for $14.99 for a gift.  The recipe they supplied was super easy....the cheesecakes were wonderful...now I want to try cakes and pies in this......so cute and just the right size.......excellent quality also
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,2.0,You Get What You Pay For,"On the second day the little spokes that hold on the lid broke. We decided we could live with that. Then things got worse. There was no way to ever pour coffee or water from the carafe without spilling. We poured over the sink. But what sent me to Macy's yesterday to get a new coffee maker was the on-off switch. We frequently found it on when we hadn't intended. It was too easily bumped when working in the kitchen. The machine started the other evening 45 minutes after my husband had filled the tank with water, but while the carafe was still in the dishwasher. By the time we heard the last gurgles from the other room there was hot water all over the kitchen counter. The on-off switch had been sitting in a half-way possition. I must admit that the coffee was good. We thought we were being very frugal getting a good deal, but not in the long run."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Absolutely Beautiful!,"This pan made a gorgeous cake (using a plain box mix)!  I made sure to spray the pan with Baker's Joy (has the flour mixed in already), the cake came out with no problems at all.  I made a strawberry cake (for the pink rose affect), made a simple glaze using pureed frozen strawberries w/juice and powdered sugar.  Then I added under the cake some hydrenga leaves from my garden for a true rose affect.  It turned out so lovely.  If you are considering this pan my recommendation is to go for it, you won't be disappointed"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Save your receipt ,"We had our Bissell for about 3 years, which I'm finding is a pretty long time in the lives of steam cleaners.  Because we have wood floors on the lower level, and use Stanley Steemers from time to time, we probably used the Bissell about 20 to 25 times, and then usually just to do one room.   "
kitchen & housewares,16 of 20,5.0,Great pans for the price,Heavy duty and scratch resistant (my husband always tests this with his house key). Good value for the money
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Results for a Reasonable Price,"We actually own two of these vacuums:  one upstairs and one downstairs.  We vacuum frequently, and, although it's not too heavy to carry up and down the stairs, it's just more convenient to have two.  This vacuum has a lot of suction, even through the hose and attachments.  It's just a great machine, and we recommend it very highly"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,4.0,Great Sharpener!,"We just received this today and my husband of one month has proceeded to put a very sharp edge back on each knife in our Henckels knife set. The reason for four stars instead of five?  When it arrived, the sharpener was not round, as I expected, but a two-sided oval sharpener. Although it is very easy to use and does a great job, it arrived with no directions.  For someone who has never used this type of sharpener before they may not find it as easy to use. But for those of you (like my husband) would say &quot;All I care about is that it sharpens the knives and it does a great job.&quot; (A direct quote from one who prides himself on putting a good edge on our knives.  As a matter of fact he is scouring the neighborhood looking for more knives to sharpen."
kitchen & housewares,26 of 30,5.0,This is all you need!,I dashed out to buy this one when I was in the middle of packing for a trip and my old Rowenta gave out. I'll never go back. Forget the more expensive irons - this one does the job and it's all you really need! I use mine every day in the sewing room as well. You'll get way more than your money's worth out of this iro

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Coffee maker,Excellent product.  My only improvement recommendation is to have a larger water tank
kitchen & housewares,35 of 35,5.0,Great cooker for the $ and travel," I have owned many slow cookers; all which were given to me, also they were typically hand me downs. This is the first cooker that I have actually bought. For me, this cooker does a great job, it does not cook any better or worse than the other cookers I have had, but it is larger and has a few nice features. 1, it has a sealed lid than can be tightly connected for travel (the other night we moved 5 quarts of hot pasta sauce to my sister-in-law's house. There was sauce all over the inside of the lid, but none of the sauce made it out). 2, It comes with a plastic spoon; nothing special about the spoon, but it attaches to the lid for travel. 3, there is a lid rest that allows you to set the lid to the side without setting it on your counter. 4, the side handles have a rubber coating , are securely attached and extend quite a way from the side of the cooker (which is good because it gets hot). This cooker did not come with the carry case, but there are versions that do. Those versions cost more than the $28.00 that this one cost me."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great for parties,I was looking for a fondue pot to give as a present for a boyfriend. I started my search in Russia but ended up buying it in the States on amazon. I loved the stylish stainless-steel design and the second glass container - it is very easy to clean. 
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,I Love This Oven,"I purchased this oven about 5 months ago and I use it almost every day.  I hardly ever use my conventional oven anymore.  The rotisserie feature is absolutely great. I've used the rotisserie for chickens, roasts, pork chops, etc..they all come out amazing!  I've baked chicken and pies and cakes, I use it as a toaster and the broiler is also phenomenal. I love that you can clearly see the food cooking through the glass door.  The only thing I don't like about this item is the grill on the top.  It's small and messy and easier just to use a frying pan.  The door does get hot, but not any hotter than the door on a conventional oven.  It's not made out of the sturdiest materials but if you're not rough with the knobs and you don't slam the door, it will be fine.  I personally love this oven.  It's made my life a lot easier when it comes to cooking"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,"Hard to find, great to have...","I have had Lodge cast iron cookware for some time now, but I have searched everywhere for these handy potholders.  These holders are insulated and make it very easy to hold the very heavy skillets without fear of burning your hand.  Thanks Amazon!!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Sturdy and easy to use!,"I prefer to use a manual can opener over an electric one, and this is one of the best out there!  I got one because I lost my old one and would definitely buy this brand again.  It's easy to use, it doesn't take a ton of effort to turn it - and it's sturdy.  Some other can openers I've tried were difficult to turn and rusted easily, but not this one!  I highly recommend it. :"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Polder digital timer,"Works great! I needed an alarm with a vibrate option and it works perfect, what I didn't realize is that I would use the flashing light option as well. You can use all three options , two at a time or just one.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,well made product,"I've had 2 of these pans for 6 months now and use them frequently for cookies and as a drip catcher under pies, etc. They perform beautifully, well worth paying a little more for. They clean up easily, nothing sticks to them. As with all non-stick cookware, can't use metal utensils. I'm not a huge fan of nylon spatulas, but do use one with these pans."

May want to RTFM to get the most out of this new toaster.  Love it so far.  Just angry that Macys did not have it on their shelf so I had to order it on Amazon.  We like to buy the rounds of soure doe bread and the slices are to long for a normal toster but they get nice and toasty with this toaster.  this toaster is a little spendy but worth every penny!

kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,1.0,Use a knife!,"This is just junk.  I purchaced this on sale, thinking that Kitchenaid was synonymous with Quality.  Not this time.  It balks as soon as a potato was even with the height of the blade.  Being a stubborn man, I leaned on it and it started to move again.  Little did I know that the metal blades were slicing through the flimsy plastic instead of the potato.  The apple slicer worked much better, lasting 4 apples before breaking, instead of 1 potato.  The item won't slice, but it will break.  It looks very nice, so it is only suitible for giving to annoying relatives that get you cheap crap for Christmas.  Don't expect to get any use out of it"

kitchen & housewares,34 of 34,1.0,Stiff Neck & Terribly Uncomfortable,"These pillows were uncomfortable and after the first night I had a stiff neck and it was painful turning it.  I find it annoying that they have the gall to claim an $80 suggested price with a 69% off for a sales price of $30.  The hard slab of foam in the middle of the pillow is the most idiotic design I've ever seen; they should just fill it up with rocks instead.  I honestly have no clue what the designers were thinking.  I want them to sleep on these pillows for a whole week as a punishment (I'm being facetious).  I must say, however, that the ""gel"" like material is very comfortable when you take out that hard slab of foam.  The problem is that there is not enough of the gel material and the pillow is way too thin.  This pillow would be amazing and worth the $$ if they put 2 1/2 - 3 x as much of the gel and got rid of that hard foam.  I like the pillow I got at BJ's wholesale club for under 5 dollars far better than this.  Don't buy this unless they redesign it; I doubt they will but it's worth a try"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Austria King Comforter,"I really like the texture and patch work of this comforter. I am really pleased with this purchase. The King pillow shams are also very nice as is the dust ruffle. The one issue that I had with this product is that it is a little small for my bed. I have a pillow top mattress, so it does not cover the entire mattress. Should they sell a California King in this particular comforter, I would by another for a better fit for my bed. I really do love this comforter set"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Spectacular step up!,"We have had our last Foodsaver for almost six years and it is finally starting to give up on us.  We had definitely put it through plenty of abuse as well, so I was not discouraged from seeking another Foodsaver brand vacuum sealer.  I love the V2840...I especially love it for the flip up and the hands free use.  I always dredded having to pull out my old foodsaver from the back of the cabinet, since it was a bit large to store on the counter.  The V2840 doesn't take up very much room and I always have the roll handy in the machine, so no looking around for the roll that has rolled to the back of the cabinet anymore.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,"luv it, luv it, luv it...","It's red and I luv it. Okay, not just because it's red- but I'm soooo delighted that it is. This blender was purchased to replace my existing blender that does not do anything well- forget about grating ice. My first mission was to make slushies and... mission successful. I'm very happy with this purchase and did I mention that I got it in EMPIRE RED, yay! But seriously I have other kitchenaide appliances and utensils and haven't been let down yet"

kitchen & housewares,24 of 24,2.0,Soft but not absorbant,"My wife and I really like Egyptian cotton towels.  We were excited by Amazon's sale and took a chance.  These towels are very soft.  A huge plus!  Unfortunately they lack absorbency qualities.  The towel feels cold as we dry off and the water does not feel like it is being absorbed.  Wet and cold is not a good feeling in the morning!  We do not use dryer sheets or any type of detergent product that would coat the towels.  As for pricing, we did NOT get a super saver discount as promised in Amazon's advertising but were attracted to the initial sale price.  All in all, we will not buy this towel again"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Fantastic Coffee Maker,"We've put this coffee maker through its paces over the past week and have been extremely pleased with the results.  First and foremost for this product is ease of use.  Set up and cleaning of this machine is a breeze.  This is our first on-demand coffee maker and we're loving it.  It will be great for dinner parties and events.  Due to the built in water filter, the coffee is noticeably smoother.  A small caution is that the coffee actually gets hotter after the initial brewing since it sits in an electrically heated internal tank.  I can't believe this style of machine hasn't dominated the market.  While not ""commercial"" in construction, I would call it above average in the consumer class of machine (strong ABS plastic, solid controls, etc.).  It is well worth the price. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,"SOME GOOD, SOME NOT SO GOOD","I bought this product because of its dual function of grinding food and extruding pasta.  The thought of having the ability to grind my own meat (always better tasting!)had great appeal to me as well as being able to make fresh pasta.  I have used this item for both several times and I am completely satisfied with the grinders ability to grind meat.  I have read reviews from some that this function of the grinder was not worth the money or the effort.  I disagree.  I have had NO PROBLEMS grinding meat.  The key is not to overstuff the grinder itself.  Cut the meat in strips (not cubes) and, one at a time, place them in the feeder chute and the grinder will feed itself.  There is not even any need to ""stuff"" the meat down into the auger.  In other words, follow directions and the grinder plastic housing will not break (no need to even put weight on it!), nothing will back up into the mixerr housing itself, and the meat will not become clogged in the feeder.  A little patience will go a long way to adding life to this product."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,soooo practical,"I just got this a couple of months ago and have used it to make tomato sauce, applesauce and pumpkin puree. I have never used another food mill before so I can only compare it to my food processor. It is WAY better than the latter since you can determine your own coarseness. With a food processor, you end up with chunks and the rest sauce-like. So you puree it for longer just to get rid of the chunks and then the rest is just too runny. With this food mill, it all comes out uniformly and it is very easy to use. And you don't have to worry about stuff flying around your kitchen (if your food processor leaks) since it all ends up in the bowl you set the food mill onto"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"It sucks, but it also blows a little","I bought this item as a resplacement for another that had lasted several years before succumbing to the demise to which all devices with cheesy plastic parts eventully succumb.  Fortunately, the Swissair I replaced was for use both with wine (suck out the air) and bubbly (pump air into the chamber), and the busted bit was stuck in the wine position, which was fine for 99% of its service."
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,"Wanted to love these, but they didn't live up expectations.",These are hard use.  The handles are too small.  They are hard to fill acurately.

kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,4.0,"Great shaker with ""Super"" tight strainer/lid...",I really like this shaker but wow that shaker is really in place!  I suppose it's a pretty good thing too because I have used other shakers and while shaking up the mix the top went flying and the icky-sticky stuff took a trip around the room.  I use mine mostly for making Margarita's.  I love that you can keep it in the freezer after cleaning so that it's nice and frosty when you are ready to use it.  But........you better work out those fingers and hands cuz brother that lid is tight! I've found the best way for me to loosen it's grip is to hold with one hand and slightly twist with the other while pushing up
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great product, The fact that you can cut on the base of the pan is a great advantage for serving. Handles 2 recipes of cheese cakes which is an advantage when cooking for a crowd.I also have a square pan of the same brand and find these pans to be of very high quality and value for money. The darker color compliments baking time as opposed to the reflective cheaper pans. A bonus is these pans are super easy to clean

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Cleaning's a snap.....,"...as long as you do it while the grill is still warm.  I use ours 3 or 4 times a week and I use lots of those bottled marinades.  As you all know, those are full of sugar and quickly become a burned-on sticky mess.  But, I've found that I can take a damp paper towel or sponge and just wipe everything right off.  If I do let the grill cool down, then I just plug it back in for a minute to re-heat it before I clean it.  For really thick clean up, just drizzle a little water from the sponge onto the burned food.  It will sizzle up and wipe right off.  I've had this since Christmas and haven't had any problem with the non-stick finish lifting off.  I can honestly say that if something happened to mine, I'd replace it the same day...I use it that much"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Dessert Plates,"I work in an assisted living facility and we use Fiestaware in the Alzheimer's area.  I didn't know these were salad plates until I was looking at all of the Fiestaware.  We have always referred to these plates as dessert plates.  They are the perfect size for a piece of pie!  They are also durable.  I have dropped a few of these plates and none have them have broken.  Thank goodness!!  These plates are very durable, too.  The style of plate is very classy and simple, which is great because you don't have to search and search and search to find flatware and glassware to match it"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Wonderful to look at AND use!,"This 'personal' teapot is such a joy to look at as well as use! The handle is very user friendly and very generous in its proportion but not too much to look out of scale to the pot's body. The lid's knob is the best I've ever encountered - no more slipping out of your fingers. It is a flat design with slight indents to really get a grip, and the trademark triangular shape makes an art statement to the roundness of the body."
kitchen & housewares,17 of 18,4.0,nice cookware for the price,"The Cuisinart MCP cookware heats very evenly and the fry pan browns nicely. Overall, it is nice cookware for a reasonable price:I cannot justify spending $400 on pots and pans.The handle does get hot after a while on the burner, but that is to be expected. The stainless lids are much nicer than the glass ones offered on comparably priced items, although I would like them better if they were domed as opposed to flat. Much condensation collects on them and removing them without spilling the condensation on the stove is a technique that you need to learn to master. The interior scratches and chips much more easily than I care for and even though the manufacturer says that you can use metal utensils, prepare to have them make their mark. I really like the brushed exterior finish. I am not one to ""baby"" my cooking tools. I scour them with an SOS pad and they get used hard and often by adults and teenagers. For the most part, I am very pleased with the ""cooking"" that the pots do. I have yet to find the perfect cookware, but this does a better than acceptable job"

kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,Great Little Heater,"After reading dozens of reviews on dozens of heaters, I gave up and ordered what looked good.  So far, I very happy with this one.  Although assembly was indicated, it came fully assembled.  It heats my son's bedroom (10 x 12) in very short order and it takes the chill off my living room (16 x 22).  I switched to a pellet heater as my primary fuel and there are some areas of my home that just stay cool.  I'm confident this will do the job on all but the coldest of days (Mid-Michigan).  The directions are easy to understand and the remote is simple to use.  The only drawback is the LED panel is super bright for my sleeping preference (great nightlight for a kid) and when the timer (max 7.5 hour) shuts the unit off, it seems to erase the preset room temp.  It then defaults back to 75 degrees.  Could be I haven't figured it out yet but either way, that's a minor thing to me.  Overall, I think I got a good deal on a good heater.         "

kitchen & housewares,20 of 20,5.0,Turns out a professional-looking product,"I grew up using my grandmother's cake pans and I still retain a deep fondness for them.  But I wanted something a little more professional, so I turned to Chicago Metallic, and was more than a little surprised at the difference in my cakes.  I've finally gotten that smooth, almost crumbless texture that is a joy to frost.  My cakes are more level now because I can bake them at a lower temperature, and the result is that the finished cakes really do look more professional.  I'm sold on this bakeware and plan on getting more pans, which is the highest recommendation I can give"

I also use it to make yummy caramel rolls. They are high and fluffy. The convection feature is also quiet. I was a little surprised at that. The rotisserie works. I used it today to make a 4 lb. chicken. Tasty and juicy! What I don't like is the squareness of the inside. Only square or round pans go inside, no 9 X 13 cake pans. Also the instruction manual can be a little vague. More recipes would have been nice. Clean up is easy. All in all, I am satisfied"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Wamsutta Flannel Gingham Sheets,I was hesitant about buying these sheets in the beginning.  I read A LOT of the reviews and saw rave statements and horrid ones.

Nevertheless, it's  a great small fry pan if you aren't a mentally challenged operator"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"My favorite knife--excellent deal, better than higher priced Shun and Wusthof","I really enjoy cooking and nothing makes it more relaxing than a beautifully well balanced quality knife.  I am lucky enough to own three incredible knives, a Shun 7"" Santoku, a Wusthof 7"" Santoku, and my J.A. Henckels International 8"".  The Henckel is my favorite.  It is beautifully made and really the best for general cooking purposes.  I love, love the weight.  It's solid, and the blade is sturdy, yet tapers to a wonderful edge.  And I can use it for finer cutting that a person might generally reserve for a paring knife.  Really, if you are debating brands and are wondering how the more expensive knives compare, I would have to say that some of the others' appeal is more based on trend than longevity.  The Shun is beautifully made and the damascus steel is terrific, but the angle of the blade's edge can be frustrating.  I find the Henckel more effective.  The Henckel Classic 8"" is the workhorse of the kitchen and such a pleasure to use. "

kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,4.0,Great for the money,"Ok, it's not the swankest machine on the market - but I got it for my birthday and I have to admit it does a good job. I worked in a coffee shop as a barista all the way through college and have used some beautiful Italian machines. This isn't one of those - but it makes a good shot of espresso from both the ground coffee and the pod with a decent crema (make sure to tamp it down really well). To all of those out there who are complaining about the temp, remember this is a pump driven machine not a boiler so if you want it hotter, hit the froth button for a few moments to increase the temp, but remember that can also scorch the coffee.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Trudeau backslid on this one,"I bought the previous version of this mug. In fact, I bought three over time -- one for my wife and a replacement for my first one when I dropped it from a very high distance onto a hard floor below. I LOVED it. Heck, I practically *evangelized* it to others, some of whom I know bought one for themselves. The original was truly leak-proof, convennient, and lasted forever. The biggest advantage to the original mug was that thte way it was designed ensured that it would NEVER become a ""dribble goblet"" the way every other travel mug does over a period of time of carrying hot beverages. Plus, I could fill the mug and still drink my coffee relatively hot 2 hours later."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Computer Rice !,"Just received this ""Fuzzy Logic"" rice cooker and my choice relied heavily on the previous 83 customers who took the time to offer their solid comments and advice. I agree that the Zojirushi is a little pricey, but if you are a rice fan and want an outstanding result each time, then this is the way to go. Simple to operate, especially if you have had experience with the old ""on & off"" switch types. I find the instruction manual to be a little less than fully user friendly (often the case with translations to English) but it can be mastered and if your measurements are close, then it is the fuzzy logic that does the real work. Don't hesitate to experiment a bit, and using chicken broth instead of water really adds flavor or just use a 50/50 combo of broth and water. makes a huge difference. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very retro looking!,"So far so good, works well, is tall enough for taller cans and looks good as well"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I LOVE this machine!,This little cutie makes delicious expresso and wonderful foam!  It's thick and creamy and delightful.  
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,1.0,not versatile for the money,"bought this item 1 1/2 years ago . worked well until yesterday, the heating rods on the bottom part just stopped working.now it's out of warranty and we have to purchase a new toaster oven.surely, i won't be buying this same brand ever again--- and this was supposed to be a good brand !!!!do not buy this product!!!!!!!!"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Take your 10-1/4-inch skillets uses up a notch!,"If you own the Lodge Logic 10-1/4-inch skillet, this cover allows for more versatility. It allows for even heating and dutch oven type use. If you prepare something, and just want to keep it warm, or use it outdoors and need protection. It also will seal in nutrients and flavors  because of the tight fit, and also the self-basting spikes. I used another lid in a pinch, but it didnt give me the same cooking results as the Lodge lid. The 3-quart chicken fryer, and 5-quart Dutch oven have the same size lids, and you can interchange those lids, but I found I was using them at the same times often, and needed a seperate lid for my skillet. For the price, it just doesnt make sense not to go ahead and have one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic in every way,"I love this smoothie maker. We use it daily for smoothies and other frozen drinks. Everything about it is convenient - except for the noise the motor makes, the machine is very loud."
kitchen & housewares,25 of 25,5.0,Awesome,"This mattress pad is awesome.  I purchased this pad 3 months ago.  Wasn't too excited about spending so much on a mattress pad but was intrigued by what the product claimed (Thermacules absorb, store and release heat as needed to regulate temperature).  I'm always cold and my husband is always hot, as is the case with most couples, this pad does the trick.  We both had the best sleep in along time.  The pad makes the bed very comfortable (it has a quilted top).  In warmer weather it also worked to make the bed cooler, which is nice as we don't have air conditioning.  I highly recomend this mattress pad and have purchased another as a christmas present"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Excellent Gadget-- Quick and Easy Crepes,I recieved this as a gift a month ago and have used it to make six batches of crepes. Its wonderful-- heats up in three minutes and crepes take about 30 seconds to bake. I used a regular crepe pan for several years: this is much easier. Crepes are great-- they always impress the guests and they are really easy to make ahead
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,so easy to use and clean,"This is a great product.  Very easy to use and to clean.  It arrived quickly, and I've been using it ever since"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Don't mess with any other hang on tank filter,"I bought the H.O.T. Magnum because it was the cheapest canister filter at the local petstore.  Good move.  Using the micron filter, it got rid of the cloudiness in my tank in about three days (55 gal tank).  I switched it to carbon and it as been working like a champ.  My tank also has two high-capacity over-tank filters of the normal type, and they constantly overflow and pour gunk into the tank.  The H.O.T. Magnum doesn't do this.  It is set to suck from my undergravel filter, which, combined with a powerhead, has really reduced floating stuff in the tank.  I'm going to get a Magnum 350 pro next and get rid of both my normal over-tank filters"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Excellent choice,"This travel mug is ideal in my mind. I have the previous design (Trudeau Neove)and this newer version is even better.  Of all the travel mugs I have owned, this one is leak proof, keeps my beverage warm, fits in my slim cup-holder and can be sipped from 360 degrees.  The lip of the cup is uneven; taller on two sides and shorter on the other two. This allows for smooth sipping with no dribble.  Looking at the design, there are only two drawbacks that I have found.  The first is that you need to use a hand to hold the cup and a hand to turn the top to ""open"" or ""closed"" position.  This is not a problem for me, but for those who desire a one handed open and close sipping spout this may be a frustration.  The other drawback in my mind is the non-slip bottom on the cup.  This feature has caused my cup, when bumped, to fall over rather than slide across the table.  Knocking this cup over when it is in the ""closed"" position does not create a mess because of its tight seal but when it is ""open"" it is as vulnerable as any other cup. I have yet to find a cup that compares, though.  It remains (by miles and miles) my favorite."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,GREAT GRILL!!!,I love this grill - it is extremely easy to clean.  Truly a non-stick grill unlike my Calphalon grill pan that is very difficult to clean.  Works great with chicken and fish and the lid is a wonderful extra feature
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Toaster Oven Casserole Pan,"This is an excellent pan to use in the toaster oven to cook meats, small casseroles, etc.  I use it to oven fry chicken, or steaks.  It is the perfect size to bake chicken breasts, stew beef for two, or meat and vegetables.  The non-stick surface cleans well.  This is my second one, and I use it practically every day.  The price was extremely reasonable and the product will last a long time"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great product,Excellent product.  Best set I have ever owned.  Cook perfectly and clean up like nothing else.  I got the whole set on sale for $19.99 so watch for a deal
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great machine which is a little loud,"Ah, now this is a great appliance to have in the kitchen. It looks great and is nice and compact, easily able to be stored anywhere. With a compressor it makes things a whole lot easier, although I must confess that I have never used the old turn and crank or rock salt and ice machines."
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,It is all in the dough,"We tried making this several times with the recipe and the directions in the book, plus several other recipes and we did not succeed at all."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Near perfect small pot......but FRAGILE,"This is a wonderful little tea pot.  Although only 2 cups capacity the pot is easy to use and extremely well designed.  Tea is placed in the infuser, off boil water poured on top and the brew process easily gauged by the clear see through design.  Once the perfect steep is achieved, compress the plunger and the steeping process is terminated.  The double wall design is not as efficient as a vacuum container but keeps the rather small volume more than hot enough to finish off a perfect pot."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Gets the job done,"This little thing is awesome! I have had mine for 2 years and it never fails me. If you want to chop things like peppers, onion, garlic...or make a small batch of homemade salsa, this gadget is the one to do the job. I have the large food processor I use for the big jobs, but 9 times out of 10, this is all I need. It works great for combining spices to use as rubs on your poultry, beef, etc. Anything to save a little time in the kitchen. Great performance"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,5.0,Ultimate German Quality,"This can opener is the finest I've ever had.  WMF products are the best in the world, considered the Mercedes Benz of kitchen supplies.  I'm in Germany, and I can tell you, the Germans know a few things about kitchens and quality.  WMF is extremely popular here; I was excited to see that you can find this brand also in the USA.  The can opener is built tough, operates smoothly, and looks simple yet elegant.  I've purchased 3 of these for family members, and they all love them"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice dish,Works great and the handle on top is a much needed feature.  My old butter dish (not fiestaware)did not have one of these and that is how it broke by being dropped
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,LOVE THESE GLASSES!!,"I am very hard on stemmed wine glasses.....I hit them against the sink, etc.....  So, my husband bought me these. I love them....much more stable and excellent for everyday use.  The wine tastes amazing in these as well.  I DONT MISS THE STEMS and my hubbie definately does not miss the broken glasses!! By the way, he shopped and shopped for these, Amazon has the best price going!!  It's worth the investment.....you will not be sorrry!!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Great pan,This pan is an unexpected pleasure to use. Easy to clean and care for. I recommend it highly
kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,5.0,LOVE this espresso machine !!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great machine and easy to learn. I have been looking for an espresso machine for several months. After reading reviews I decided on this one and am glad I did. Just be sure to read the directions and you will be making espresso before you know it. Don't give up after the first few tries--you will very happy with the final product. I am a beginner at this and had a wonderful espresso after the first few tries
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,Bad Buy,"Good suction but the rotary brush has no power, it barely rotates when contacting carpeting."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Throw out the those old measuring cups!,"If you have been measuring liquids by the ""bring your eye to the level of the liquid"" method taught in home economics years ago (when schools still taught home economics and dinosaurs roamed the Earth) you owe it to yourself to try these wonderful, back-saving, don't-have-to-bend-over-because-I-don't-feel-like-it measuring cups.  The shape isn't what you're used to in a measuring cup:  it looks as if they took a skinny little cup and smooshed it onto a larger cup by mistake.  But it's perfect - like so many OXO products, someone actually sat down and thought about the way people use a measuring cup and how it could be improved.  My old plastic measuring cups are now demoted to kids' toys:  these are the measuring cups I plan to use from now until OXO develops another breakthrough in something as basic and simple as a measuring cup"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,GREAT PAN!!!,"I ordered this pan 2 months ago.  The delivery was fast and the item arrived in perfect condition. It's beautiful... deep black in color and a sight to behold.  All the roasts, ribs and chicken have turned out flavorful and very tender.  Cast Iron imparts it's own wonderful flavor to all that is cooked in it.  It's almost a smokey flavor.  I use only wooden utensils to avoid any scratches that might remove the wonderful seasoning.  If you scratch down to the cast iron itself you risk the possibility of rust formation.  If rust does happen it will have to be reseasoned again. I wipe the surface with olive oil after each use to help keep it perfect.  This 5 qt. dutch oven has a more updated look with clean lines.  I like the new modernlook. So take proper care and it will last a hundred years or more.  Pick one up and enjoy. "
kitchen & housewares,23 of 30,1.0,A Huge Disappointment,"I love Kitchenaid products. The handmixer, manual can opener and the mini chopper are all great products. This is not. This is only the second product I've ever ordered from Amazon that I am returning. This tea kettle is a thing of beauty...elegant and sturdy with quality construction. My love affair ends there."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,So useful!,"This bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up.  I use mine constantly, and didn't think I would when I bought it.  We reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters I own.  I love my Fiestaware, you can't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Wonderful Set- I love it!!!,You wont find corelle sets easily in stores. But Amazon is selling almost all varieties of sets at reasonable price!! I bought mixing bowls and the 16 piece set along with this 7 piece set!! Its wonderful even for gift!! I loved my set very much
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,A good kettle,"This is a good value for the money, heats quickly and is not hot to the touch - a nice change from my last electric kettle. We use it many times a day"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 13,1.0,Not compatible with European stand mixers,Great disappointment. That summarizes my experience with this attachment.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,4.0,good for vegetable and cooked food,I have two cutting board. One is for un cooked and another is for cooked and ready-to-eat food. It is good to use every day. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Amazing bowls!,"I love this set! I bought it for my college dorm room and I use it to eat all my favorite foods! It's a great set - use it in the refrigerator to store things and microwave-safe. From cereal, to grits, to ice cream, to macaroni and cheese it's the perfect size for individual portions or even doubles."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,My First One!,"I was a little nervous about making the yogurt, but my first time out it turned out fabulous!  This is a very simple machine with very clear instructions.  Used 1% cow's milk and can't wait to make the next batch"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Sears like a restaurant pan,Wow!  This is a great pan to have around the house.  It allows me to feel like I'm at the restaurant!  I can sear and brown meats (I did a couple of chicken breasts in it last night) and they look and taste great.  All I had to do is add a little oil and the chicken was perfect!  It does stick a little but that's what is suppose to do right?  It gave me some great little bits and pieces left in the pan that I deglazed with a little white wine and it made a great gravy for the chicken.  This is definately worth the money I paid for it!
kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,Repeat Buy,I wore my last Seal-A-Meal out!  I use it several times a day.  The only warning is do NOT USE THIS MODEL to vacuum out air when marinating with liquids.  They get sucked into the machine and make a mess then eventually will wreck the machine
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Best ones out there!,"I already have a couple of the KitchenAid Mats like this, and a few other brands.  The KitchenAid ones beat them all!  They do not pucker like my other ones have, and handle the hottest pots or baking sheets with ease.  Maybe the other reviewer got a bad one, but I lucked up with mine.  I will be replacing my failures with more KitchenAid mats"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,"Good for maintenance cleaning, especially if you have hard floors.",Roomba cleaning is as good as a light stick vac o but the best thing is that it can clean while you're out...
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Filters for a cool pet water dish,"My cat loves this thing, but he likes to put his food into it then fish it out if he can.  This gunks up the flow a bit and I have to clean out the whole contraption every two weeks or so.  The filters are a decent price and you need them to keep the water at maximum freshness. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Fabulous Iron,"I am very picky about my irons and this one passed the test with flying colors!  It's light weight, non stick, and extremly fast and efficent!  i would reccomend this to anyone"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,I Got A $50 Lemon!,"I bought an extra battery as spare. Unlike the original one that came with my Roomba, this one doesn't always charge in 3 hours. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, it doesn't matter how long it is connected to the charger, it remains in a barely charged (orange light) state. I have to take it off the charger, run the vacuum once to the end song, plug it in the charger again and pray that it will work this time."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Excellent towels,"I bought these because of the cheap price, but I am really pleased!  They are large and very soft.  I would stick to the lighter colors because they are more absorbent (darker colors have fibers that have absorbed more dye so they can't absorb as much water).  So far these towels have not left a lot of fuzzies so I think they are an excellent deal"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love this item!!!,"These are the best plates ever! My 2 y.o threw one on the tile floor the day after I revieved them, I almost screamed, and ... it bounced!! There was not a scratch, or chip! These are the best plates for kids ever and they are really cute. I will never buy another brtand of plates as long as I have kids"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,Good machine but missing parts,"The item in itself is quite wonderful with the exception that the wooden food pusher was missing from the food grinder attachment. A replacement was requested but the wrong set was sent, the pasta maker only and not the food grinder which contained the missing part. I gave up as going back and forth to the post office to mail returns is not straight forward. This is not Kitchen Aid's fault of course but the suppliers - Amazon."
kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,4.0,Like a costly  cast Iron pan,I bought this recently because of the price point...I have the same pan in the 11 inch. I consider and treat both pans as I would a seasoned cast iron skillet because of the rough satin finish on the interior. This  is not a good pan for omelets because of the interior finish.  I wish Le Creuset would make some skillet with  dark colored interiors in the smooth enamel finish
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent!,"Pressure Canner works great - excellent for canning all the tuna and salmon.  Customer Service is very helpful when I've had problems, along with the instruction manual.  Read it"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Prepare for the Compliments,I spent all day in the kitchen preparing for a dinner party and what do I get the most compliments on? My flatware. Our friends have gone crazy over the look and especially the feel of this great stuff. We could not be happier. We have had no problems with the knives. You won't be disappointed
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great litterpan w three cats,I'm disappointed in the lousy reviews I've been reading.  I've had this pan for years without any problems whatsoever.  I was so  happy with the pan that I bought one for my parents' 3 cats.  They like using it too.  The only thing I would change would be to give it a larger litter area.  This pan has worked flawlessly for many years.  I'm considering buying another one just to have a newer one again
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,The Best Steak Knives Ever!,"I received a set of these steak knives as a gift for my wedding shower last year.  They are absolutely astounding - they cut the toughest meat, and make slicing tomatoes a dream.  They do not bend or warp like other steak knives I have used.  I just purchased a second set, because my husband loves them so much the first set is constantly in the dishwasher!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,2.0,Too small for toast,The first thing we tried to do after purchasing this was toast two pieces of bread.  We could not fit two slices side by side and part of the bread stuck out of the top.  Returned
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love this iron!,"I've alwasys wanted a cordless iron. So, when I finally decided to purchase one a couple of months ago, I compared the features of many different ones. The Panasonic seemed to be the best, and I have been thrilled with it. Just set it on the base plate when you would normally set it up at the end of the ironing board to turn your clothes. When you are ready to pick it up again, it will be hot enough to continue ironing. I've used it for about 5-6 ironing sessions now (4-5 pieces of clothing each time), and only a couple of times have I had to wait 2-3 seconds for the iron to get back to its full charge -- only happens on the highest heat settings. To me, this is a very small price to pay for not having to fight with the cord, which always seemed to drag across my clothes wrinkling up what I had just ironed! Needless to say, I am very pleased with my purchase"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,An amazing knife,"I bought this knife as a replacement for a cheap one that we used for years but was finally too dull to keep. After using it, I can't figure out why I didn't buy this a long time ago. It's fantastic. The handle grip is terrific, you get great leverage and the blade is wicked sharp--it's almost scary. I own both Henckels and Wusthof, and to me the Wusthof is definitely the superior blade. I highly recommend this knife"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,2.0,"Happy at First, but not after 14 months","I love the design and stainless steel (no plastic taste).  Enjoyed the coffee for awhile, but after a year we've been experiencing periodic short brew times producing nearly clear coffee.  Seems that frequent cleaning, especially where the tube meets the bottom of percolator improves coffee perk.  Pouring some coffee back through the top produces more flavor.   It's a great piece of hardware, but the increasingly inconsistent perk leads me to give it a low rating.  For daily use I'll go back to press coffee and use the farberware for parties."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Good while it lasted,"I loved our panini grill.  Unfortunately it lasted for less than 3 months and as it was a gift they didn't honor the warranty (no proof of purchase).  For the few weeks it worked it was great.  But overall, not worth the money because you'll have to replace it in 3 months. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Best deep  fryer I've ever used,The fryer is wonderful. The owner's manual leaves a little bit to be desired. The manual never stated how you know when the oil is at the temp you desire unless I overlooked it. The way you tell is the indicator light goes off. It's easy to clean and there is no oil spattering out with the closed lid design. It heats up rather quickly also. We have one at our primary and second homes
kitchen & housewares,24 of 24,5.0,"Soft, comfortable, beautiful, good fit","I've had these sheets (white/queen) for a few months now and am very happy with them. They were soft out of the box but are getting more comfortable with each wash. I haven't noticed any pilling. They have a light sheen and the hemstitch detailing is a nice touch. If you have a thick mattress, these are the sheets for you. My mattress has a small pillowtop, and I have some extra material to tuck in around the edges of the fitted sheet, so these sheets will fit even the deepest mattress. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another set for myself, and they also would make a nice housewarming or wedding gift."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Great piece, but don't expect it to arrive quickly","I have the tangerine one and I love it --  it's great for using in the microwave to make Rice a Roni and stuff like that.  However, my father ordered the Periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered --  for months.  We finally cancelled the order and I got something else from my wish list"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"A coffee syringe! Excellent, easy, efficient!","This is engineered with a simple syringe mechanism that forces the hot water, under pressure, through the grounds like the old, pneumatic Italian expresso machines--you know the ones in the old bars in Roma, and it makes absolutely the BEST coffee in around 30 seconds flat. Absolutely super, I have thrown out my huge collection of press pots. After brewing, I usually dilute it for an Americano early morning brew. If you don't dilute, you have expresso that rivals the expensive pod machines! No bitterness, no aftertaste, just pure, strong, savory expresso!"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Fuzzy and blue!,"I just bought this blanket in anticipation of winter.  If you've been to Brookstone and felt their NAP blankets, you might have an idea of what this blanket feels like.  It's very soft, cuddly, and fuzzy, like extremely soft chenille.  It's also very generously sized.  I'm really looking forward to cold weather so we can pair this blanket with our new sheets.  We may never want to get out of bed again"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great Pan - Easy to Use,"I love this pan!  I used it for the first time yesterday and it perfomed exactly as I hoped it would.  Followed the directions to ""oil"" the cups - I used PAM - and the muffins just slid out with no problem.  Clean up was a breeze and it is ready to go for the next time.  The sled keeps the pans from bending and makes it easy to take in and out of the oven.  The muffins also looked very professional - no breaks or pieces missing"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,I'd give it 6 stars if I could. ,"The fryer with lid is definitely the best choice for me.  My first fry was hamburger.  Then I boiled off the burnt bits, wiped off the ash, oiled the bottom and placed in the oven at 350 degrees for one hour. I hope to finally make pancakes, scallion cakes, injera, pa jeon and more burgers.  I didn't know how pretty and perfect this fryer was until I saw it for myself.  Cast iron shapes have never moved me not even to make my own bibimbap but the proportions of this fryer are very pleasing.  I hope more people will buy this variation with lid and maybe they will become enamored with cast iron and enjoy the full benefits of cooking with it.  I just tried an omelet in this and it browned it more than my paper thin wok but it still did the job.  This is a versatile version indeed."

Your results may vary, but mine had no blemishes, has plenty of battery charge, and leaves my carpet feeling clean.  Its first trip around my apartment filled its bin, which I believed to be a good sign.

kitchen & housewares,10 of 12,1.0,"Defective, bad Quality control",I bought this based on recommendations here.  I assume the other reviewer's arrived without defect.  On mine one of the four tubular steel legs was not bent to shape as the pthers were.  It was effectively shorter than the others by about an inch making it far too wobbly for use unless I put something under that leg.  They clearly have a quality control problem at the factory to ship this out.  I therefore cannot recommend this item

Amazon shipped me the smaller version of the fan it advertised but still charged me the same higher price for the large fan it should have sent.  I sent the small fan back to Amazon and ordered what I should have received from Kaz.com.  The product is great, Amazon's service wasn't"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Well built - Effortless,"I also bought the fine grater from this company. Both are great tools. They will grate mounds of cheese in no time and with no hand fatigue. I have little strenght in my hands, and I was a bit worried about getting a hand grater, rather than an electric. But this greaters are super sharp and do a great job with no effort. The attachment is recommended. For smaller pieces of cheese (or chocolate...) it will save your fingers. With so many poorly designed tools out there, it is a real pleasure to use one as well made as this! Highly recommende"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,excellent!,"got my machine and made my first batch of strawberry ice cream and my my my it was delicious!!!!   Then i tried slushies by just poring coca cola into the container and let it go just for 15 minutes and you have the perfect slushie!  Then I tried the sorbets in the receipe book, you won't have to fly to Italy, you make it right at home!  Then a week later company came over and i chilled a bottle of our favorite wine in it within 15 minutes!!!!!  This machine is just grand!  It is heavy and takes up counter space, but believe me it is worth it.  I rate it 4 stars because it doesn't shut off automatically, but that should not sway you from making this purchase. Well worth the purchase, and the money you will be saving, and not only that, your ice cream is healthier!!!!!!!!!"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,perfect for 1-2 people,"Works well for about 2 cups uncooked rice. We especially like the non-stick pan.  It does sputter some liquid from the sides if you try to cook more than 2 cups.  Overall, very satisfied with this purchase.  It compares favorably to other cookers we've owned in the same price range and size"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 10,5.0,rip off,"I bought this at amazon ,but it's cheaper at www.cutleryandmore.com $9.95,so is the $89.00 wusthof santoku 7"" knife ($79.00),and they have FREE shipping ! Check yahoo shopping be fore amazon!!!"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Functional and Nice Looking,"You can't go wrong with Le Creuset bakeware, and there's so many uses for these colorful little gems.  I use them to hold a variety of dipping sauces and other condiments, and they add a really nice touch to the presentation when making individual desserts, like apple or peach cobbler.  They also can be used to hold small-size snacks, like nuts.  &quot;Flame&quot; and &quot;Jade&quot; are also great colors"
kitchen & housewares,20 of 21,2.0,Cheap glass,"For the price I don't suppose this is a terrible choice.  However, I chipped the base the very first time I washed it.  You have to be very careful because this is not high quality glass and will break on you very easily.  In addition, the base is MUCH lighter that the cover and makes for a somewhat top-heavy arrangement when there is not a cake on the base"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,very pleased with purchase,"i have been bying smaller humidifiers for a number of years, never satisfied with the results.i bought the best that i could find, locally, until i got on amazon, and started a search."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,best value,"I did extensive research before purchasing this automatico. I am going on 3 months now. The machine makes about 10-12 cups of coffee or espresso a day. So far it is outstanding! I do wish the water was just slightly warmer, however as long as you heat your cup first with hot water from sink or the machine the coffee will be very hot. Cleaning is a breeze. I just empty the spent coffee and the waste water at the end of the day. In the morning I add fresh filtered water from the refrigerator. Once a week I take out the internal brewing gizmo (simple) and rinse it in hot water. I enjoy espressos frequently. We make 2 different types of coffee. I drink cafe americano. It is just 1 shot of espresso with hot water added. it is a velvety cup of coffee. My wife like the cafe crema which is just a 7 or 8 oz espresso. The machine always produces a beautiful crema! I highly recomend this machine for the great value"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Beautiful!,"I'm so glad I bought these sheets, especially since I see that they're more expensive now!  They arrived today.  I washed them so that they would smell fresh.  They wrinkled a little bit, but they're cotton so that's expected. "
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Very poor performance,"The pan doesn't perform as stated.  The muffins along the perimeter of the pan baked well enough, but the inside muffins were still underbaked, very gooey.  Am extremely disappointed with this pan"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very Good Product,These fry pans are a excellent deal for the price.  The fry evenly and clean up is a snap.  I would recommend this product to everyone
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,I love it!,Kept my birthday cake safe to the party- last year we hit the brakes and- we ate cake sooner than expected!
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I couldn't make pies until I got this,My mother had no problem rolling crusts on an old pastry cloth. I never could. I was given an item like this  and I have been making crusts and great pies for 30+ years.  I plan on buying another one for my future daughter in law.  Make sure you use the rolling pin sock as well and do flour both well
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Simple and Elegant,"Well maybe not so simple, but it definitely works great. It's a pleasure to use and looks great in a modern style kitchen drawer with modern utensils. You will not be dissapointed, simply the best   manual can opener available."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,0 stars for scale but 5 stars for amazon for prompt refund,Three of these were ordered as gifts. What an embarassing situation. All were defective and all were design flawed. I don't know how one would put 11 pounds on it without it breaking into pieces. Poorly conceived and made worse
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,4.0,Almost perfect,"This loaf pan makes beautiful bread, but the bottom is a bit narrow and widens toward the top at a greater angle than other loaf pans, so the bread is not shaped as nicely as it could be for sandwiches.  I like the wide lip which keeps the edges of the bread from over browning or burning.  My only complaint - and it is a small complaint - is the narrowness of the bottom and the wider angle of opening to the top of the pan.  I purchased Pampered Chef unglazed stoneware loaf pans and they are slightly superior for bread making."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best toaster oven I've ever owned,I've owned this for about 3 years and have yet to have a single issue with it. I use this oven a lot... at least 5 times a week. 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,1.0,Don't Waste Your money,"This is a piece of Junk juicer. I thought since My family had used Juiceman Jr juicers in the passed that this was a nice Juicer. However, the first one we recieved from another online store the juicer came broken on the bottom.  We had this since September or so however , we put the juicing up until just a few weeks ago when we wanted to have juice to get better.  So I went to Juice some apples, carrots and lemon's an hour ago.  The Juicer choped the white pusher thing and then my husband relised that the bottom of this one is broken. If you want a Juicer get a top of the line juicer"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,Great Skillet to take camping,What a great skillet to take camping. Took this up into the Smoky Mountains National Park and it was by far the best piece of cooking equipment we packed. It's a little heavy but worth it 
kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,4.0,Great Coffee,"I have owned this coffee maker now for 1 month. The coffee has superb flavor. Only 1 drawback, it is difficult to clean"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Still in Love,"I bought the Kitchenaid bakeware set 1 1/2 years ago.  It has been used hard and put away wet, yet after many uses, I am still very pleased.  The pans are durable, hefty and breeze through the dishwasher.  The round pans have a crisp edge and smooth finish making a cake that plates perfectly for frosting stacked layers.  The oblong pan is at ease baking and roasting and the loaf pans are a extra sized which makes a whopping big loaf of bread without running over. The handles are a real advantage in grasping the pan for removal without getting your thumb or the potholder on the edge of the cake and squashing it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product,Roaster is lightweight and durable.  Most roasters are too heavy to lift if they aren't flimsy.  This roaster cooks great and is easy to clean. I'd recommend it for anyone who likes to cook using a roaster
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,5.0,Beautiful Pies,Emile Henri is worth every penny for someone who really loves to cook.  Pie crust is crispy even in the middle on the bottom without using a lard crust!  These items are easy to clean and look BEAUTIFUL
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Very nice!,"I sent these to my niece for a wedding gift. According to her they are ""incredible"". She was very pleased with the beauty of the lace edging and also the quality of the sheets"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Best little timer,"This timer is fantastic.  It can time four events.  It has a separate clock which is always accessible.  Each of the 4 events can be counted up or down.  The timer can be used as an alarm clock, by counting up from the present time to the time to wake up.  No need to think about time zones.  This type of timer is visible in the background of one of the space shuttles. "
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,no eggs,"This egg cooker didn't work when I purchased it, so I had to return it"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great value,"I wasn't going to buy a pitcher at all for my new espresso maker because they all seemed outrageously expensive for what you got. This is a good size, works well, cleans up well and is comfortable to hold"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 14,1.0,Krups rice cooker a bust,"The Krups rice cooker was a huge disappointment. The slower cooker portion was useless--there are no high/low settings, and the manual doesn't indicate a default temperature. It also made horrible rice, and the steamer didn't work, either."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 11,5.0,I love this machine.,"I thought at first it was stupid to buy an iced tea maker, but I repent, we use this machine every day.  It makes great iced tea, and I don't have to mess with a kettle to boil water or microwave a pyrex cup.  Someone recommended this as a good way to drink green tea, which I think tastes bad hot.  They were right.  Not only that, but we whip up all sorts of great blends.  If you like iced tea, and drink a lot of it, buy this"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,Emile Henry is a winner anytime,"This baking dish was my first investment in Emile Henry.  I was amazed that everything they said about Emile Henry was true.  It bakes beautifully, distributes the heat through the food evenly, holds the heat and looks good on the table.  The best part about it though is how well it cleans.  After all the things I have baked it in from desserts, to meats to vegetable dishes, it looks as beautiful as the first day I bought it.  I am pleased to take it to potluck dinners because the food has been cooked to perfection, it stays warm and the food and the baking dish look good on the table.  Emile Henry overware makes me look good as a cook!  I am also proud to give anything from Emile Henry as a gift for birthdays, showers, weddings, and holidays. People are impressed with it. I highly recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Another excellent Kitchenaid wonder!,"I have this Kitchenaid hand blender, and absolutely LOVE IT.  It is very powerful, handles any blending job you could throw at it, and cleans up very easily.  Storage is a breeze too.  I had a Braun hand blender before, and when it died, I bought this Kitchenaid model.  If I had known the Kitchenaid was as good as it is, I would have thrown the Braun hand blender away when it was still working.  This Kitchenaid blender is far superior to any other models I have used.  The extra attachments are quite handy, and snap on very easily.  The unit is not heavy at all, an has a very ergonomic design to it.  I have enjoyed using mine so much, I have purchased two additional Kitchenaid Hand Blenders to give as gifts. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 20,1.0,Not a hot item,It simply doesn't keep the food hot. A waste of money
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,How Did I Live Without This??,"I must admit that I bought this because Alton Brown used a disher to make his meatballs.  Brilliant!  I've used it to make perfect meatballs, perfect cookies, and the cutest little ice cream scoops for dessert.  It's been through the dishwasher at LEAST 10 times, and works perfectly every time.  I used the small disher/scoop to make what my husband dubbed ""the best cookies you've ever made.""  I HIGHLY recommend this set of scoops"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Good vacuum for stairs and upholstery,"This vacuum is wonderful. Way easier to handle on the stairs than my upright. The cord is not long enough to do all of the stairs in one shot, but neither is the one on my upright. It does a very good job at removing cat hair on furniture. We have one chair that has been dubbed the cat chair. I had given up on the chair before this vacuum, but now the chair can actually be used"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Recommended Toaster,"With daily use this toaster has been a welcome addition to our bench top. The brushed stainless steel profile is sleek, easily cleaned and the long shape accommodates a variety of bread types. It is a consistent performer with even toasting in both the frozen and fresh settings and copes well with repeat use. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Nice durable Corelle!,"This particular pattern in black cafe is very suimple, yet very nice because they make quyite a bit of accesories, too. I was surprised how sturdy the glasses are. I dropped one about 14 inches in my sink and it did not break.  i am very pleased. the delivery was very fast. Arrived unbroken"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,One of My Best Purchases,"I have used this for just about every kind of cooking imaginable and it has passed with flying colors. I have made soups, pasta sauces, roasts, chicken, done deep frying, you name it. Together with my cast iron skillet this forms the main tools in my cooking toolbox. Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,"Cheap, thin, Made in China, glass","Don't waste your $$, or think this is a good deal even if they are free.  The glass is the thinnest I've ever seen in wine glasses, even when compare to cheap grocery or big box store varieties.  The glass is so cheap, it is doubtful they will last a week.  Try something else.  Not sure where the other reviewer comes up with 5 stars.  I'd rate is a 0 if that were an option. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,finally the bread browns in my conventional home oven,anyone who makes bread at home knows it's tough to get french and italian bread to brown evenly.  End of problem with this produc
kitchen & housewares,3 of 19,1.0,I do not like being lied to!,"I purchased this product line in a retail store. The packaging clearly states it is dishwasher safe. Then after you unpack it, and read that if you put it in the dishwasher you void the ten year warranty! Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this product"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Smooth,We replaced a much less expensive manual opener with this.  The difference in the way the handle turned was amazing.  The Oxo is smooth and easy to operate
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Worth it,   I have 3 of these. You can fill it with ice and your drink of choice and let it sit overnight and there will stil be ice and a fresh drink in the morning. I also use it on hot summer days on canoe trips. My cold drink never gets warm
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,1.0,Unnecessary unless you have really bad tasting water in your house,"If you use filtered water for making your coffee (i.e., Brita filter; under-sink reverse osmosis filter; built-in filter for your refrigerator's in-door ice and water; etc.) you do not need to filter the water again in your coffee maker.  I would only suggest buying these filters if your water is not filtered and tastes bad from the tap.  Otherwise, these filters are a huge waste of money"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,2.0,Don't Overfill,"I thought it would go well with my new Cuisinart Coffee Maker.  It seems to take longer than my old Krups unit.  If you overfill it simply won't grind the beans. Once you get the hang of the amount of beans to place in, it works OK but still seems to take longer than other grinders"
kitchen & housewares,26 of 27,2.0,Dishwasher Safe?,"I like this item alot and this is the second one I've owned. Don't put the lid in the dishwasher because it takes the finish off. It happened on both of mine, thanks to my roomate. The screws that hold the handles come loose frequently and the aluminum threads on the base strip VERY easily"
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Not worth packing home,"I washed the griddle prior to using it to fry an egg.  I used some olive oil on the griddle.   The coating stuck to the egg when I turned the egg over. The coating is not non-stick.  After several uses there are four spots where the coating has ""ripped"" off.  I used the grill to cook hamburgers once and I will go back to using my contact grill.  Cooking the burgers is not as quick or easy as the contact grill is. To top off my disappoitment when put on the stove today I found that it had become warped.  When I want to cook pancakes next time I will use my 50+ year old cast iron griddle"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"These are functional, classic and a great deal!",I got the eight piece set and I am so pleased with them.  They cut extremely well and look elegant on my table.  Would recommend to all... and the price can't be beat
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Awesome cup,"I've owned this exact cup for 5 years now; use it at the office.  Coffee is still warm (not hot) after 4 hours!  This must be truly vacuum jacketed.  Once in a while the o-ring doesn't seat right and leaks as other reviewer said, but you just have to try again or clean the o-ring.  One design flaw is lid does not have a sealable hole for driving.  If you tip it over full, a fair amount will come out before you pick it up.  I suppose a compression fitting type lid would also be better than a screw in typel.  I'm looking for one for my wife now. "
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Great cookware,"I have never owned a good set of cookware before purchasing the Anolon Advanced 10 pc. set. I had always owned the cheap $10-$15 per pan stuff you buy at Wal-Mart or similar stores. I was lucky and was able to find a deal on this cookware at Bed, Bath & Beyond for about $230. The choice was either Calphalon or the Anolon, and because I got the free knife and the great deal, the Anolon won out."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 27,5.0,This Knife Is Crazy Sharp,"I absolutely love this knife!! I use it to cut vegetables and slice bread. Plus it works very well on meat. Why just last week I was attacked with mine by some man during a break in and let me tell you, it cuts like a beauty. Left me hurting and glad that I had bought two. I would definitely recommend this knife to anyone who wants it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,Thermostat not right,"I received this unit as a gift.  Thinking the fancy programmable features made this an upgrade, I gave away my older crock pot (which I loved).  Mistake!  I've been noticing that it takes forever (two days!) to cook pot roasts and stews to the point of tenderness, and almost as long to soften beans, so finally I measured the temperatures with a cooking thermometer.  On high, the food is 175 degrees, low is 160 degrees, and keep warm is 140 degrees.  At this temperature, the unit is mostly good for cooking rice congee overnight.  Otherwise, you are burning electricity for a long time. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful set!,This is very lovely set! Especially the bowls!! They come with a nice delicate row of leaves design outside the bowls which you normally don't found in other corelle sets. Also the plates are not shallow as compared to other sets. I am still looking for matching platter and large serving bowl!! Unforunately Amazon doesn't carry them!! Also try the bake-serve set available on amazon which matches this one. You can't get same set elsewhere easily
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best set of knives for the price!,"I bought these knives for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.   I love them!  My own set of knives is the Henckels set from Costco.  They are always needing sharpening, and even then I can't get them sharp like these ones are.  I wish I could trade mine in!  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Elligant and soft,"I was so impressed with these, such elligant designs.  Big"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Pie Crust doesn't stick!!! ,"This is the absolute best rolling pin EVER! My husband bought it for me for Christmas, and I LOVE it! I snapped my marble rolling pin's wooden handles making pie for Thanksgiving, and this one far surpasses the old one. It rolls on ball bearings, so it is incredibly smooth. It is expensive, but if you like to bake, this is an must have."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,faulty inserts,"This product is a great idea and would be wonderful.  However, I have to versions and both of the thermal inserts that you heat in the microwave have exploded.  Also, I have been unable to find replacements"
kitchen & housewares,17 of 18,5.0,a good press for the price,"I received the press today. Considering the low price, I found the press very useful.  The time it takes to reach temperature is just a few minutes, it's super easy to use, and it doesn't take up a huge amount of room on my sewing table.  I pressed denim shorts, ribbons, and even a very wrinkled t-shirt successfully.  The press is small so I can easily move it out of the way when I need more space.  I am happy with it!   "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Gotta have one...,"We have AllClad LTD but when our old electric griddle died, we picked up one of these.  It's such a luxury to have flip food so easily compared to a regular fry pan - I actually look for excuses to make eggs, pancakes, grilled cheese, etc. on this griddle"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great one cup coffee system,"I purchased the Melitta One One Pod System about a month ago and in my opinion this is a great coffee system.  I use the Javana coffee pods that I buy at Stop & Shop and they work fine and taste great.  I had problems with the first 5 to 6 cups I made, but the machine has worked perfect since then.  I highly recommend buying this machine"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,Rolling herb mutilator,"Like all OXO products, this is ergonomic. However, it has the slight flaw that it doesn't actually mince herbs. Tried it with parsely, a fairly durable herb that slices easily. The herb mincer managed to slice through some of the leaves on top, but left a layer of mutilated leaves underneath! It did not matter how hard I pushed, the bruised leaves would not cut! Even if it did work the wheels are not closely spaced enough to mince; I would describe it as closer to chopped. You will be much better off with a sharp knife than with this worse than useless product. I returned mine the same day"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Does its task admirably,"I have always been a bit skeptical of the Calphalon Contemporary line due to the thickness of the blade on the chef's knives.  However, as I've used some of the specialty pieces, I have had to re-evalulate my position somewhat.  This knife is such a case."
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,"Nice, fluffy and very absorbant.","To reviewers who said towels are not absorbant:  Not just these towels but any cotton towels that are washed with softeners will not absorb water.  You'll need to wash them with regular detergent without adding any softeners and they will come out from the dryer very nice, very fluffy and very absorbant."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Tote Bag,Can't camp without it! Perfect for carrying my dutch ovens easily to the campsite. Sturdy construction and protects my cast iron from rust
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Beautiful heavy-duty set,"I just received 2 sets of the Corelle Hearthstone in the green for my birthday (yes it is what I wanted and not a dumb husband buy).  They are beautiful and very heavy.  Definitely do not feel like a cheap set of dishes here.  The plates fit just fine in my cabinets with no room to spare.  I love the fact that the ""lunch plates"" are just right for a normal meal and not small saucers to go under the mugs.  I'll probably use the lunch plates a lot for our dinners or else we are going to get very fat.  I am looking forward to curling up on the couch with a good book and a large mug full of hot chocolate.  I think I already wish I'd gotten a 3rd set for when we have company over.  Christmas isn't that far away..."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,1.0,What a deception!   Kitchen-Hell ,Nota Bene:
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,"great deal, great stuff!",I gave this as a wedding gift to my brother.  He and his wife love it and are very pleased with the excellent quality of the flatware and the simple elegence of it
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,A note on the included glassware:,"This is beautiful Correlle. If you buy this set with the glasses, factor in  the glasses are going to start breaking quickly. The set with cups is a better value, IF you like cups and saucers. Sadly, there are no mugs in this pattern, just plain white. The glasses last as long as any inexpensive glassware. I got my set at WalMart; shop and compare"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Good toaster- Good Price,"Perfectly adequate toaster at a good price. Toasts evenly and well, although a little slowly. Great value"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Product,"This is a great product for storing dog food.   The wheels are sturdy and make it easy to maneuver the bin when filling it with food, or moving it to get food out of it.  It seals securely to keep food fresh and keep out bugs (and anything else that likes to snack on pet food.)  I don't use the treat bin on top of the dog food container, b/c I found it too cumbersome on the lid, but use the treat bin separately.  I highly recommend this product"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Nice Pan,"Nice cast iron pan. Less wieght without the sides. Nice for flat pan grilling. Works great, ships fast"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 32,1.0,Don't put the beater in the dishwasher,"Wow.  The beater and dough hook are ""burnished aluminum"" and you CAN'T PUT EITHER ONE IN THE DISHWASHER!  I have read that you can get coated ones, but people then complain that the coating comes off in the food."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Works Great on my 11-cup DLC 8,"My Cuisinart processor came with a 4mm slicing disc. I aim to collect all of the DLC 8 discs/blades. This 6 mm blade works great, but I noticed it really isn't much bigger than the 4 mm. It makes a great backup blade in case the other one is dirty. Love this stuff. Great price too at $19.95"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,2.0,broke within first month,"We have had this machine 2 years and put up with the broken head that cracked after the first month.  Then about 2 months ago, it stopped spraying.  I guess they only make it last for the first year.  I called Bissell's customer service and they said there was nothing they could do for me.  Wouldn't offer a discount on a new unit.  Don't bother investing in this machine if you want something that lasts"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,THe CRC-400 4-cup Rice Cooker gets High 5 and show and tell by my wife!,We have had 3 other rice cookers.  They were of low quality and it showed.  
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,A $49.95 value?,I was not thrilled with the advertising on this one that claimed it was a luxury towel set with a $49.95 value. The set came in a plastic bag and the quality of the towels were very low average. I was not impressed and wish I had not bought so many.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Perfect for dips & little snacky things,"These little bowls are used all the time at our house. They're great for casual entertaining; one little bowl for nuts, one for olives, one for some sort of spread. I also will put dip in one, then place in the center of a dinner plate & surround it with veggies. They're just nice and easy; a great addition to any collection! And like all fiestaware, very sturdy and has held up to a lot of use."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,super!,"This is a great little measuring cup...worth the small price!  I like it so much that I hand wash it and then hide it on a high shelf far from the reach of my kids who love to cook, but are destructive to my cooking tools!  Great buy"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Top of the line!!!!," You absolutely cannot go wrong with this can opener. I had always purchased the cheapies before this( the kind that you have to angle this way and that just to get half way around the darn cans). Who wants to spend alot of money just to open a can?? Well, I am soooo glad that I spent the extra money. You barely have to turn the knob to get a can open, plus it feels good in your hand. I suffer from carpal tunnel, so my hand would cramp up easily. Not with this opener!! I highly recommend spendind a few extra bucks for this one"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great little pot,"Great little pot for general all-purpose use.  No complaints - heats evenly and is well-balanced.  Cleans easily, and has good heft for the price.  Looks good, too"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very close to being erfect,"I am Asian and rice is my primary meal. I love rice and have eaten it all my life and I could tell when it's properly cooked. This rice cooker ROCKS! It would be perfect if it's made in a more contemporary exterior material such as stainless steel. I bought it along with a rice cooker recipe book, and have experimented with polenta, oatmeal, and some other meals other than just plain rice. So far I am very pleased with this cooker. It's very user friendly and clean-up is a breeze due the the excellent non-stick coating of the inner pot. If rice is important to you, then the extra dollar is definitely worth speding."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 17,1.0,Dimensions are different,Beware...the dimensions of this item are not 12 inches as stated.  It is actually 10 1/2 inches.  I was told that the 12 inch plates are no longer available from the manufacturer
kitchen & housewares,21 of 21,4.0,"A nice high quality kettle, but sluggish shut-off","I bought the Breville SK500XL two months ago and use it several times a day; it is indeed a nice looking, high quality electric kettle, and I am satisfied with my purchase. Here are several additional points and issues, beyond what was given in Amazon's product description:"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Good Buy!!,"This item is great for the price you get....a little cumbersome to clean, especailly if you make tea by boiling loose tea powder in water within this kettle. The whistle works great and tea is ready in a few min's..:)"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great fan - great value!!,"This is truly a ""blizzard"" fan.  It moves lots of air even on the low setting.  It may not be ""whisper"" quiet but it is by no means a noisy fan. I fall asleep with it on easily.  During a 2 week heat wave here in California all the stores were out of any decent fans, so I found this on Amazon and it was at my doorstep in just 3 days.  Easy to assemble and like I said, it moves lots and lots of air and really cools my biggest rooms.  Great fan and a super value"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Where's the info?,"I like my Zojirushi rick cooker but I'm amazed at the lack of information on how to use it, especially how to cook basic rice and the exotic kinds of rice.  Thank goodness rice is fairly inexpensive so I can experiment. Zojirushi, get a real manual!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great glasses,Just received these glasses and I am delighted with them.  The Mikasa Cheers collection is lovely. The martini glasses are large enough to contain a full size drink. 
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Not too hot,"I baked six loaves in this machine.  I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right.  My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Cuisinart rocks!!,"I very thoroughly researched all the nonstick hard-anodized products out there and decided on Cuisinart because it had the most vesatile product selection.  The 5-1/2 quart saute pan is the bomb!!!  It heats faster, cooks faster, and clean-up is a breeze.  The first time I used it, I cooked a stove-top dish I have cooked many times, but because the hard-anodized cooks faster and hotter, I neglected to turn the heat down to accommodate this and the whole meal was burned and I thought to myself, Oh, great! the first time you use the pan, you ruin it by burning the pan.  Well I took it to the sink to pour out the remnants that were not burned and had anticipiated that I would have to soak and scrub the pan and when I tipped the pan the entire burned mess just slid out of the pan and it looked as if it had never been cooked in.  What a pan!!  I LOOOOOOVE this cookware. I bought every piece that Cuisinart offers in this line.  BUY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Better than expected..lucky me, I bought this griddle to replace several other expensive ones. I have and failed.They just did not do the job. To my surprize. WOW! ..This griddle was much bigger than expected. Lucky me. I was so impressed with the size and quality. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Really Nice!,"This glassware set is first rate.  In the past, I've always been haunted by glassware that is TOO THIN (and thus breaks easily) .... but these are THICK, STURDY, and HEAVY.  No chips; no cracks. And they look beautiful and expensive.  They're just the right size, and can be used for casual or formal dining. "
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Absolutely wonderful!!!,I love  this pan! We have a large family and I easily fit 5-6 chicken breasts in this pan at one time. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Better than a ice bucket.,Very good for keeping wine chilled without taking up a lot of space.  Especially good for going out to dinner when you bring your own wine
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Disappointed with Past Bowl,"I am happy with the delivery and the packaging. The bowl looks like it is chipped on the bottom base but upon closer examination has proven to be areas that the paint and glaze did not adhere. The bowl looks chipped though. There is an area on the side of the rounded part of the bowl that is scuffed, as if sand paper was rubbed against the bowl. I am unhappy with the condition but I only paid $11.00 for it. I like the color, even though it doesn't appear professionally painted and glazed. I would opt for something different next time."
kitchen & housewares,19 of 23,4.0,A Taste for the Natural,"When chilly autumn breezes fill the air, our thought always turn to applesauce -- homemade, warm and fresh from our Kitchenaid mixer.  The fruit and vegetable strainer attatchments make this fall treat possible.  It's ability to turn out perfect applesauce (as well as tomato sauce, jams and other natural, homemade goodies) makes it a welcomed addition to any kitchen.  We simply cut and core the apples, bring them to a &quot;mushy&quot; texture on the stove, and dump them through our Kitchenaid food grinder with the strainer attatchments in place.  In seconds, we have fresh applesauce, as well as having plenty to can or freeze. Don't sell your Kitchenaid mixture short -- use these valuable attatchments to see it do the amazing"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Great set!,"I did quite a bit of research, trying to find a good but ""reasonably"" priced cookware set. When I read the reviews for this KitchenAid set, I thought I would give them a try.  I LOVE THEM!!!  I used them to cook Christmas dinner and couldn't have been more pleased with my purchase!  Clean up is an absolute breeze!!!!  It truly is non-stick without using oils or butter.  The only downside is that food does get stuck in the rivets, which is the only time you have to use a little elbow grease to clean these pans.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,GLAD TO HAVE THESE,Very nice cutters in practical sizes that came in a small clear box to store them in
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Very Nice,"I have all three sizes.  These give the appearance of high quality.  They are very nice looking, almost too good looking to use.  Bamboo is a very tough surface, I can see that it is tougher than Maple.  These are made with small pieces of bamboo glued together, I assume it will hold together over time.  It also absorbs water less so than wood so is quicker to dry.  I put some mineral oil on mine to protect the surface and the appearance.  The only cavaet I see is that MUI uses a glue to hold on the label that you cannot totally remove.  This is only at few small spots, however this is a rediculous practice that I am sure most of you have seen before on other products and found annoying. I nearly would deduct a star on the MUI product for this, but I will let that go.  Stop it MUI, you have some nice products but use your heads"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great pan,It's a solidly good pan to make practically anything in. It effectively retains the heat in when the lid is on. 
kitchen & housewares,35 of 35,5.0,"So far, so good....","I just received this oven yesterday after waiting nearly 6 months for it to be in stock.  I wanted a convection oven to replace my beloved microwave/convection oven that was too tall & wide to fit anywhere in my new kitchen.  This oven had the right dimensions (barely, though, at 23.5""w x 14.25"" h x 21"" d), the right capacity (can easily hold a 9 x 13"" pan) & the right price.  It also has a rotisserie - an unexpected bonus. The timer has an old-fashioned ticking sound because it's a dial rather than a digital one.  The sound is actually rather soothing.  The fan is audible, but not annoying - but that's the nature of convection cooking.  I must say that I do have this appliance in the old wall oven cabinet, so that muffles the noise somewhat.  In person, it's a very commercial-looking piece of equipment.  It feels quite sturdy.  The glass in the door is clear & you can see anything cooking very easily.  Before I used the oven to actually bake or roast something, I heated it up to test the thermostat, using my oven thermometer. I set it to 350 degrees & that's what it went to & held.  Baked a scalloped potato dish in it using convection & it came out beautifully golden brown with just the right amount of crisp on top.  I have high hopes for the performance of this oven - & its warranty is satisfactory at 1-year for appliance & 5-year for the motor. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,I'd give this ZERO stars if I could,"Less than a month and a half after receiving this percolator, it gave up the ghost. About two weeks ago, I noticed the coffee wasn't as hot as it should be. Two days ago, after brewing was completed, I poured myself a nice warm cup of light brown water. I tried making another pot, thinking I had goofed on measuring the coffee. But I hadn't. The percolater simply no longer worked. LESS THAN A MONTH AND A HALF AFTER I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX. This was the fourth electric percolator I'd had in about six years. I'm not that hard on them -- I don't fix coffee every day, and I never fix more than one pot a day when I do. But they each and every one -- and I've had all makes -- stopped working less than a year after I got them. This one, however, takes the cake. Not only was it a waste of money, the coffee it DID make was really not that good, and the pot itself is downright ugly, with a very thick, heavy handle (I have small hands), and an unnecessarily long spout that is impossible to clean out. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this percolator. I'm now going to check out drip coffeemakers"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Mixing Bowls,"Nice and heavy, strong and durable, great bowls.  Would definitely buy again"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,4.0,"Made in Malaysia, but not a bad thing.","I thought maybe I would be lucky and get the ones made in England.  It looks like all of them shipped from here on out will be from Malaysia.  With that in mind, you are not getting the several hundred dollar set as the list price indicates.  Nevermind that though and look at what you do get.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Amazon didn't mess up this time...,"This is a great set. My parents have had this set for almost 20 years and I decided to buy these for myself. I'm just happy Amazon sent these all in one piece, unlike most stuff they ship"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,5.0,Terrific Workhorse. Second Best piece I own.,"In all the years I have spend browsing through cookware shops, I never spotted this very special kind of cookpot, which, I believe, may be unique to French cuisine. I believe it is also known as a brasserie pots or casseroles. They are uniquely adapted to the braising technique, where it is important that the tight fitting lid be close to the level of the liquid. That is, there should be very little headroom above the liquid."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Cheers!,"My husband and I were outfitting our new vacation home and needed just about everything. Since our list was long, we chose items that looked good and were priced right. This glassware fit the bill - it's a nice weight, pretty design, feels comfortable to grasp, presents well, and didn't break the bank. With proper handling, it should be durable as well.  Thanks Target"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,worth the money,"Like all purchases, I hesistated on this grinder.  Now that I've had it for a couple of months, I'm glad I got it.  I moved up from a Capresso unit that was flimsy, loud, and left a big mess.  This one is none of those things.  When I pull the drawer out with my grinds, it does so neatly and smoothly, breaking a small seal betweem the grind compartment and the unit.  I dump the grinds into my filter, put the drawer back, and there are little to no grinds anywhere but in the coffee maker.  It takes up less space than the Capresso or many others that I've seen.  Sure, the grind settings are inside, but I haven't changed it ever since I found the first one I need.  The one flaw?  The cup numbers on the gauge are off- I use the 12 cup setting for 6 cups.  I'm used to it by now, but how did they come up with these numbers?"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,5.0,The Henckels 4 Star Knife,"I have owned this particular knife for 5 years now and it is one of my favorite and most useful knives.  As a professional chef, i own several boning and filet knives both curved, straight,and stiff and flexible.  At 7 inches it is long enough tobe used for everything from trimming tenderloins to cutting through tuna loins. it has a decent heft and the handle is large enough to fit my hand (a problem i found in other knives) another feature i enjoyed with this knife is how smooth itis without any crevices to harbor microorganisms in its handle or bolster.  My girlfriend on the other hand finds the blade a bit too long for use in our home. prefering the 5.5 inch pro s boning knife.  I also enjoy the slight flex in the blade it allows me to use knife in situations suitable for either a flexible or a stiff bone.  All in all it is extremely useful in a professional kitchen and not a necessity in a home kitchen but it is very nice to have in both settings"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Terrible- don't buy it,"I have bought 4 of these litter boxes for $100 each and ALL of them have broken in some way... sensor, motor. One of them works half the time now and I've had to throw out two. I thought I just got a bad one or that the cat was hard on it. Well... these are made for cats to use, are they not? They sure don't do the job that they advertise they do"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Christmas gift,Was very pleased to find this product on amazon.com.  I found them on sale at Kohl's and after calling and driving to several stores could not find the colors I wanted.  My daughter said to check Amazon and there I found all the colors I wanted and also they were less expensive.  Very very pleased.
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Powerful fan and compact size,This is a great fan.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the speed settings should go from low to high but instead they go from high to low.  Not a big issue but enough that I can't rate it as perfect.  The fan not only pushes a lot of air but serves as a great sound buffer.  I can open my window and not worry about being woken up by passing cars or barking dogs.  Because I use it in the bedroom I don't point the fan directly on the bed but instead about a foot above to circulate the air.  I don't think it's ever a good thing to have a fan blow directly on you
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Save your wine all the time.,"When I used to drink wine with my wife, I had 2 options drink the rest of the bottle or throw it out.  I have been using this device for the past 3 months, and I am glad I did.  Now I can enjoy a single glass and drink the rest later.  I have kept a bottle of champagne for up to 2 weeks and the last glass is as good as the first.  I just had a glass of wine that I opened 1 month ago and it still tastes the same.  The ease of use and its cost is an advantage in addition to its primary function.  I strongly recommend this product.  It should go with every bottle of wine that you take to a friend's house for dinner"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Fantastic knives,"These knives are amazing in every way. They were super-sharp right out of the box. They are solid-feeling, full-tang, and very well balanced. The variety of knives handle all cutting jobs. Even the block has a really solid look to it. The steak knives, although not forged are also of excellent quality- they're the best steak  knives I've used. There's no reason to buy knives that cost any more than this set"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 18,2.0,Fiestaware 1 qt pasta bowls....I got what I paid for!,"While seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $4.99 here at Amazon.com, I didn't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago. What a great price! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day. The packing is nice and secure. The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Don't judge the iron by it's cover...,"This iron is such a piece of junk.  I bought it because, as with most impulse buys, it was the 'prettiest' one on display.  I used it a handful of times; this iron made you dread the job even more than normal.  It got hot enough to be dangerous, but not hot enough to remove those nasty wrinkles from your clothes.  Over, and over, and over, and over you'd iron--only to have your clothes look like you'd freshly pulled them from the dryer, rather than spent 30 minutes ironing a shirt so it could look so-so.  SteamMASTER?  What steam?  After ironing for 20 minutes, the steam might act like it thought about steaming, give a small 'poof' of steam, and it was done.  That was all the steam you got.  No steam?  OK, just shoot it with the mist button.  Sure--if you hold the iron 10 inches back from your clothes.  Perhaps Sunbeam figured it would be fun to GUESS where to aim each time you spray your clothes. Well, after using it, oh, probably ten times...kapoot.  Dead as a doornail (whatever a doornail is).  "

Only drawback was that I couldn't clean the stairs. But overall, the Dirt Devil steam cleaner is an exceptional product and affordable"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome!,"I love this electric kettle!  I use it 3 or 4 times a day to boil water for french press coffee, oatmeal, tea, etc.  I have not had the problems with the lid which others have mentioned- clicking it closed before turning it on is a no-brainer and I have never been splashed with water."

I spent over $300.00 for this machine! It is sad that engineers could overlook such and important component! The spout on the carafe, regardless of how the carafe is placed, leaks water when pouring. I am going back to my Bunn, which is a superior product in my opinion."

We were so intrigued that we immediately ordered a second as a gift. The first one opened about 18 bottles before its innards were sprung.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 14,2.0,Not worth it.,I bought this an was very excited to eliminate the dustbuster and swiffer to go with one cleaning tool.  But it did not work well and I lost the adapter to charge it after about a month.  Can't find an adapter to replace it and I don't want to pay a lot for a new one.  So this purchase was basically useless for me
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,This is THE Vacuum,"I have labored with purchasing a new vacuum for over one year.  I have read the vacuum reviews by Consumer Reports.  I've learned my lesson about relying on a Consumer Report review.  I bought a Kenmore Dishwasher which they rated as #1.  It turned out to be the biggest piece of junk in our kitchen.  So, I don't trust the good folks over at Consumer Reports any longer.  I've also read everything (including all the reviews on Amazon) I could find on the internet pertaining to vacuums and talked to several authorities in the business.  It was very confusing because each vacuum has it's own little nitch.  I looked at Kenmores, Hoovers, Eureka's (all uprights), and several other lesser known brands.  I tried them all.  I chose the Dyson Animal and I'm glad I did!  I have five dogs (yes 5) and a parrot who sheds her down feathers on a regular basis.  Needless to say I needed some heavy duty suction power.  When I used the Dyson for the first time I filled the canister three times.  I was shocked on what was left in our carpet from our Hoover canister.  My wife and I both noticed that our house smelled cleaner.  I guess there is something to the Hepa Filter.  If your like me and are considering a vacuum, don't be afraid of the Dyson price tag.  I did the math on the the Kenmore upright.  By the time you buy the extended warranty, the bags($4 each) , and the hepa filter ($20 every six months).  You'll be spending over $220.00 a year at Sears for the life of your vacuum.  That's no bargain!  Dyson has a lifetime filter and is bagless.  It also has a five-year warranty."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,4.0,Nice... but wish it were non stick,The set is gorgeous and has a nice weight to it.  The only con here is that the stuff should have a better nonstick interior.

kitchen & housewares,20 of 20,5.0,Best Egg Cooker on the Market as of 2005,"What a delight it is to know that I can have hardboiled or poached eggs any time I want, with almost no effort, and no supervision.  You can put your eggs in the machine when you wake up, go upstairs to shower, and never worry about it, because the machine shuts off by itself when it's done.  Hardboiled eggs are done perfectly every time.  Moreover, if you want to have hardboiled eggs without the bother of taking off the shell, you can just put four eggs into the poaching tray and fill to the hardboil mark.  "

If you're going from freezer to oven, we've found it practical to place the dish in a cold oven and let the dish and oven heat together. It's great for under broiler use - place dish about 2 &quot; from heat for maximum broiling efficiency or simply a light toasting. As we've learned over the years Le Creuset is quality cookware - even offering a lifetime warranty, but we're not giving ours up"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Extraordinary,"I was so surprised when I received these spatulas because they were FAR nicer than I expected for the price! Very heavy, beautiful to look at, the big one is HUGE ... MAN-sized, in fact, which my husband loves ... and wonderful quality. Just one spatula of this type is usually so expensive, but you get two in this set and far better quality than any I have ever seen"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Willow Sheets,"This set is beautiful. The color, texture and fit are excellent. I bought another set in a different color. For the price: fantastic"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent machine for the price,"We've had this machine for about ten years, and we do not average more than a six uses per week, usually at dinner parties.  It is simple to use, has a stainless steel boiler, and seems to be sturdy for its price.  It can  make very good espresso, capuccino and latte, so long as you use high-coffee quality and take care in the grinding and tamping. The only problem we have had was scaling after about five years.  The steamer stopped working and we thought it was dead. We used a commercial de-scaler (and a pin for the steamer tip), and it returned to service.  It does leak a little bit at the steamer when on, but that is a small problem.  I think you would have to spend three to five times the money this costs to get a noticeably better machine. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,I'm buying my second one!,"My family has had this toaster for over two years and we haven't had any problems with it.  As a family of four big toast eaters we use it often.  I agree that the switch for the 1/2 slice vs. 3/4 slice is backwards but other than that no complaints.  We are purchasing a second one for our 100+ year old vacation home because this toaster will fit in nicely with the style and space constraints.  In the past we have always purchased cheap, ""disposable"" toasters which last no more than a couple of years. We are willing to spend the extra money to buy a toaster that isn't going to end up in the land fill in another 2 or 3 years!"
kitchen & housewares,23 of 26,2.0,not so happy,"I bought this cuisenart food processor two years ago since I have liked cuisenart products in the past. Though it looks nice I don't particularly like how you have to click the bowl and the stopper into place - they have gotten stuck and it takes more fumbeling than necessary. The bowl had a small crack within weeks ( just from normal usage) but it still worked. I make a lot of breads and was excited about the dough feature but the motor clearly struggles - the machine moves around and gets very hot. After a kitchen contractor managed to start a kitchen fire (don't ask) which melted down the bowl, lid and stopper I looked to replace them. Not only was customer service less than helpful, they were unreasonable expensive and not even in stock. Imagine not getting replacements on a two year old widely used appliance and no help from customer service. ?!?  I ended up buying a kitchenaid foodprocessor which was not only slightly cheaper but has a stronger motor and a better rating in consumer reports plus great customer service. It makes dough without any effort and the setup is simpler and seems sturdier. I wouldn't switch back even if I got a free cuisenart"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,good sheets,"I like these sheets, the only thing is they are heavy, so I'm going to wait till winter when it gets cold to put them back on the bed. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Solid Performance; Excellent Value,"This is a terrific machine.  Amazon's price beat everyone, especially with their 20% promotional discount, no sales tax and no shipping charges.  The oversized feed tube makes pre-processor preparation much simpler as I don't have to try to ""fit"" my ingredients into a narrow tube.  Clean-up is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the fully-sealed motor/base which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any misses/messes.  It's quiet and efficient.  I only wish that there were more outlets (hear me Amazon?) that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level.  Overall, I am highly satisfied and happy I spent a little more and got the best"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Good coffee requires a good grinder!,"I am delighted, and completely satisfied with my Capresso 560 cone burr grinder.  After giving up on blade grinders five years ago, I had used a Capresso 551 flat burr grinder.  This grinder was a great improvement and I was satisfied.  Over the years, because of things that were my fault, I had to write to Capresso for help.  Their response was fast, complete and satisfactory.  When the 551 gave up (likely from overwork) I bought an inexpensive Melita burr grinder.  On its finest setting, it would not grind nearly fine enough for my espresso machine.  "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Some flaws, but overall a great fan","This fan is by far the most powerful out of the other two I purchased and subsequently returned (a Holmes and a Pelarious). No digital display and temperature gauge like some other models, but it makes up for it with it's high quality motor. It does start to get louder as time goes by, but it is nothing as loud as will keep you up at night or anything like that. Overall, this is probably the best window fan to date, but some improvements upon it would be nice"
kitchen & housewares,20 of 31,1.0,Died after three weeks,For the first three weeks I was very happy with this product. It sealed both bags and canisters quickly and efficiently.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Can't beat a rolling pin that gets cold! ,"I don't make piecrust that often, but when I do, I want the best tools for it. This rolling pin is AMAZING! One of the common mistakes making a pie crust is to let it warm up...so why not use an ice-cold pin?!  And I pity the burgler that comes in if I'm within arm's distance of this pin....;"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,4.0,Not Really Dishwasher Safe,One of the first things you'll notice when you pull this pan from the box is the slip of paper mentioning that dishwashing is not recommended and will void the warranty on this pan. 
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent Product,"Is roomy enough for 9x13 cakes, the lid locks tight, and is also great for locking in the freshness of vegetables if you want to use it as a relish tray. As long as you're not transporting the relish tray from one location to another, however, as the veggies get mixed up and fly all over the place. But the see-through lid allows display of cakes."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Great Muffin Pans!,I looked all over for pans that made the big muffins and not only were they none stick but they were on an incredible sale so I bought five
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Excellent design,I've had this scale for 10-12 years. It has outlasted several of those spring loaded things you can get for $10.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,First OXO Failure,Love their products but this simply doesn't work.  The sponge fails off with the slightest bit of pressure.  Did I get a lemon or what
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,A pleasure to cook with,"The first thing you notice about this pan is the weight.  This is due to the thick bottom and solid sides.  This construction allows for very even heat distribution and excellent results in cooking.  With no ""hot spots"", there were no burns and clean up was easy.  This is not the cheapest 8 qt. stock pot sold by Amazon, but it is one of the better ones and is a very good value.  For boiling water, the cheap pots are fine, but for soups and sauces, invest in a good pot like this one"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,The Best,I received this Le Creuset 4-1/2-Quart Round French Oven as a birthday gift and it is perfect in every way. I cannot recommend enough the overall quality of le Creuset products. They are also very attractive and add enjoyment to all forms of cooking. This particular 4-1/2-Quart Round French Oven is a great size and shape and can be used for a variety of things. It also fits perfectly upon the le Creuset trivet. Other products of similar quality you might try are Global knives and Cuisinart appliances. You won't be disappointed
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Must-have accessory for Senseo!,"I love good coffee, and viewed the ""pod"" requirement as a serious drawback to the whole Senseo system.  Enter the Ecopad: this clean, convenient, inexpensive filter, sized just right for my Senseo, affords me freedom to indulge in all of my local whole bean coffee favorites while still enjoying the simplicity and speed of a single-serve coffee machine.  I simply grind a few teaspoons of fresh beans, fill up the Ecopad, snap it together and brew.  Even preserves the bit of foamy goodness typical with the Senseo pour.  And clean-up is a quick rinse.  I'm hooked"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Magnetic Blinds,I love these!!! They are sooo easy to install and I love the fact that you don't have to drill holes in your metal door. They were here within a few days and I had them up in minutes
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Tip broke 1st time I used it,"Usually I love Henkel, but this one I must say, the tip bent while in the sink the first time I washed it and when I tried to straighten it - it just plain broke off"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Beautiful and balanced knives,"These are a beautiful set of knives that are perfectly balanced and have a nice solid handle.  I found that they felt more secure in my hand than the thinner and more square-shaped ""three-rivet"" handles in the Henckels four star line or the Wustof classic line.  Every single knife from the large chef's knife, to the small paring knife feels substantial and well engineered."
kitchen & housewares,20 of 21,5.0,Buy Several Double Pot Rack Hooks,"The Calphalon Double Pot Rack Hook works well on the &quot;cross beams&quot; of the Calphalon wall rack and hanging racks. You can use them to hang two omelet/frying pans back-to-back or as Calphalon suggests, a pan with its lid. For the wall rack, I recommend buying 2-4 double hooks; for the hanging racks, where you have more room, buy as many as you think you might need. It takes time and planning to get your hanging arrangement the way you want it. As your collection of Calphalon grows, remember to order extra pot hooks too"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Favorite for Egg Scramble,"The last review says this is comparable to a spoon.  Yeah, that's true.  It is not shaped or sized like a turner. But I was looking for a spatula-you know, like a rubbermaid bowl scraper but it's used for cooking.  Any who...my husband has claimed this little spatula.  It's perfect for his egg scramble. Doesn't scrape non-stick pans. And wow, husband can't melt it, not even when he leaves in pan while cooking. Absolutely no sign of wear or heat damage. 600 degree resistant--I love it.       "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Definitely worth the shelf space!,"I love this pan!  I have the All-Clad stainless line, and bought this pan when my youngest daughter started to like grilled cheese sandwiches.  You just can't cook more than one sandwich at a time in a regular fry pan.  This pan has plenty of space to cook 4 sandwiches at a time, or 4 pieces of french toast, or 4 eggs...  the list goes on and on."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,"After Hours of Research, I Picked This One & am Pleased","I'm totally pleased with this product.  I researched the single serve coffee machines for hours on end.  I selected the Krups over the Braun, the Keurig, the Senseo and the Tasimo for the following reasons:"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Every kitchen needs it!,"Let's face it, if you don't know what Pyrex is you don't belong in the kitchen cooking. They do take a good amount of abuse. Yes, they will break after years of use, but it is just one of those plain old good products that has been around a long time"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Fiesta is great! ,I bought 6 sets of 4 piece place settings for less than $100.  How can you beat that for Fiesta ware
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Don't forget the egg whites!,"If you do any baking requiring whipped egg whites, this bowl is the perfect companion to the 4.5 quart bowl that comes with the mixer.  Beyond that, it's just nice to have if the big bows is tied up and there's something left to mix"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,We drink the coffee quickly...so any negatives are mitigated.,"There are two of us who use this coffeemaker.  The coffee is very hot initially...but keeping the coffee hot on the ""warmer"" is not an issue as we finish it rapidly. The coffee is good flavor and we are fairly well satisfied."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Fast and Easy!,Worked much better than plastic ones I have had previously.  I also bet this cleaner won't break as the others did.  The &quot;teeth&quot; really help to grip the shell making it easier to cut through it.  Goes in dishwasher
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great but be careful,"These are great bowls for noodles, rice, soup, etc. They arrived on time, BUT one bowl was broken at the chopstick hole. It was replaced promptly but I'm sure that is a weak point on the bowl and will have to be careful washing them"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Go ahead. Live a little.,"When my Wusthof Grand Prix II 7"" Hollow Ground Santoku knife arrived from Amazon as a mid-year birthday present to myself, I tore open the packaging and immediately bonded with the high carbon no-stain steel beauty inside. The knife *gleamed*, was obviously surgically sharp and, for an intermediate cook who had been using a 1980s-era Chicago Cutlery chef's knife all her life, it was a bit...intimidating."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Useless (or at least near-useless),"This clunky mini chopper seems pretty useless to me.  If someone finds something that chops well using this device I'd be interested to know what it is.  Everything in mine either a) jams the device up or b) ""bruises"" whatever I'm chopping so bad the result is completely unappetizing.  "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,The best!  Quick and easy.,"I recently purchased the corn zipper.  Absolutely terrific gadget.  Fast, fun to use, easy to use and a nice sturdy quality tool.  I have other gadgets for removing corn from the cob but this one is by far the best"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,Why did I wait so long to get this?,Great for those receipes that require weight measurements and not volume measurements
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,A pleasure to have really sharp knives,I have to agree with most of those who have reviewed this item and found it well worth the price.  It's a pleasure to use really sharp knives.  This machine took just a moment to put a razor edge on even old knives that had been in my odds-and-ends drawer getting banged up and dull.  Doesn't take up much storage space either.  A very good buy
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,A handy tool to use with the microwave,"First of all, this item is a handy way to easily cover items in your microwave.  It replaces using plastic wrap, wax paper, paper towels, or another dish.  It's also handy because as they get dirty, they can be washed by hand OR in the dishwasher.  Covering the food allows it to heat faster.  All good things.  "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,Best Juicer I've had!!!,"The Omega 4000 is the best juicer I have owned. This is my 4th juicer. I started out with the cheap'o's (one was a juiceman jr). I mainly juice carrots with apples. They did not last long because the motors would burn up.  I later spent the money and purchased an ACME brand juicer (spent over $300).  The Acme juicer was powerful.  It's drawback was that it had to be cleaned out if I wanted to make more than one glass of carrot juice. I really did not enjoy juicing with my big Acme, so it was eventually given away. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Great purchase,I was shopping around for a nice sized stock pot (but nothing so huge that i couldn't wash it in the sink).  I had it narrowed down between this pot (the Cuisanart 12 Quart) and the All-Clad 12 Quart.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"buy the Cuisinart Chef's stuff, any..its all good!","I read the reviews and purchased this and some other pieces and starter set and frankly, what a great deal!  these clean up well and don't need high heat and look great, so if you are looking for a bargain price for good quality pots and pans, get these any of them and collect a set as I am doing..they are great"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Best Scraper Spatula!,Look no further! This is yet again another superb silicone spatula by KitchenAid.  The large handle makes it easy to get a firm grip on it when you are stirring or scraping.  The silicone spatula is flexible but not flimsy.  It will not melt or fray and it couldn't be easier to clean.  Don't bother trying to lick the bowl because you won't miss a drop of anything with this spatula.  Very Highly recommended! A+
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,4.0,"Will protect your pans, silicon could use a little better grip","These tongs are definitely sturdy, and the silicon coating will help protect your pans.  I've used these for a couple weeks and the only drawback is that the silicon can sometimes be too slick to really grab onto food.  It's more of a problem when the food is in water (like pasta)."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Another Excellent Knife from W�sthof,"I bought this knife for my dad a few weeks ago (for fathers' day).  He uses it almost exclusively in place of his older knives now!  The 6-inch design is a perfect length for almost any job, too."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Well built - Effortless,"I was looking for an electric grater, because my hands get tired very easily and grating had become a real chore. After reading reviews, I decided to give a manual grater one more try. Well, it is a pleasure to use a well-designed tool that delivers what it promises. Grating is effortless, you can produce mounds of grated cheese in no time and without hand fatigue. I bought the attachment for it, and while I have used without it for larger chunks of cheese, I recommand it for smaller pieces. The grater is very sharp  (that is what makes so easy to use), and you would not want to grate the tips of your fingers with it! Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,Beware,This machine is not strong enough to push the dough through and it stops.  I would not recomend this unit to anyone
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Works fine!,"I have 3 pairs now, and they are fine.  I don't see how you can actually break one of these, but if you do, they have a lifetime warranty, so no biggie.  I actually bought 2 more pairs for around the house, like one in my tool box, kitchen, and for opening those crazy plastic packaging"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Quality pad for the price,"The teflon worked very well on some possible permanent monthly stains. The edges are not cheap synthetic material so I doubt my fingers will poke through it any time soon when stretching it onto the mattress (like my last pad). My only issue is that since my mattress itself is nylon on its cover, the pad tends to feel slippery underneath the sheets. When I turn, it also slides a bit. With the right texture mattress cover, I think it would be fine. For the price, I will live with it and be happy I bought this pad"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent value,"Excellent value for good quality, stylish flatware. Takes a little time to get used to the increased weight as these pieces are heavy duty good quality stainless. Should be part of our home for years to come"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Good Product for a Good Price.,"This is a well-made, versatile, attractive, almost-""professional"" set which, if you look around for sales, offers a good deal for the money (mine was from Macey's, special $39.95).  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Very good grill/griddle and am very happy with this,"I spent a lot of time looking for a grill that I can cook on.  I do heavy bbq'ing including burgers, vegies, French-toast, and Korean bbq (kal-bi) so I wanted to make sure I get a nice grill.  This grill is awesome! Heats up very quickly and cooks very very well.  The grill is quite big so it's hard to find a place to store it, but since I use pretty often, it is not a big problem.  I usually put it on top of the fridge in the kitchen and it's fine.  Both grill and griddle work well, but be careful not to scratch the surface.  More than anything, this grill/griddle is very easy to clean, just use hot/warm, water and some liquid soap and all done.  I am hoping this grill will last long since I used my last one for over 5 years.  By the way, I found this grill at Macy's for $120ish, so this is a very good buy at Amazon."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,It works just fine.,"You can not argue with the price on this item, and it works fine to get the job done. The rollers in the main unit are easy enough to clean. The cutting blades in the attachment are a little difficult to clean. It would be ok if you could rinse it out with water, but they do not recommend doing that. I would give it 5 stars if it were a little easier to clean after use. "

Preheats instantly and is the perfect size for a meal for one. If you're having guests over, you can turn on your oven and wait for it to preheat. When you just want a quick and tasty bite for yourself, this is your gadget. "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,this is a BIG pan,"When I ordered this, I didn't really think about the size.  Amazon shipped it in one of their own huge boxes, and the pan was in perfect condition.  I used it for the first time the other night, and realized just how big it is.  I have an older stove, and once I put the pan on a burner I discovered that I couldn't use any of the other 3 burners.  If you have a small stove or one where the burners are close together, keep that in mind."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,An American Classic!,"The KitchenAid mixer is a solid and reliable work-horse.  As an experienced and avid cook, I can attest to the versatility and craftmanship of this mixer.  It is not only able to handle everything I have thrown at it, but the results have always exceeded my expectations.  Some people may balk at the price tag but rest assured that, in the long run, you will save plenty of money because this is the last stand-up mixer you will ever need to buy.  My only complaint about this mixer is the fact that my particular unit doesn't seem to engage very well when I select the first (and slowest) speed.  Sometimes, I need to play with the speed knob to get it to engage the slowest speed.  Despite this minor complaint, I am still rating this mixer as 5 stars because of its durability, ease-of-use and overall appearance.  Once you have mixed and kneaded with a KitchenAid mixer you wil never want to use any other mixer"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Well Designed Product,"It's easy to carry.  Simple, safe, and short time to boil.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great product!,"We had previously been using small handheld steamers, which required frequent water refills and wore out quickly. The Conair Professional Upright Steamer does a much better job and fits nicely in a closet between uses. My husband steams his own work shirt and slacks for the next day while watching TV in the evening! It only takes him a few minutes and keeps me from having an ""ironing day"" or the added expense of sending them to the cleaners"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,I Expected Better from This Company,"The price was great and I was already familiar with the quality of this company's merchandise, having used some of their pots and pans for years since marriage.  When the stockpot arrived, it was just so pretty and I couldn't wait to use it.  The first time was great.  However, this time I was putting together a black bean soup and as I scraped the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, I became aware something had happened.  A day or so later, as I took all the soup out to transfer to a bowl, there on the bottom of this pan was all the enamel coming off in big pieces.  I couldn't believe it!  It is ruined and I will never be able to use it again.  It's just so pretty and the perfect size, so it's a big disappointment.  I won't buy LeCreuset again"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,I Don't Know What Everyone Is Complaining About,"I use this crock pot all the time. I use it for stews, curries, pot roasts...especially during the summer when I don't want to heat up the house by using the oven...and everything cooks perfectly."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Replacement after 20+ years,"Great kettle, fast heating.  Without a fill-hole on the top, steam doesn't escape when pouring - a great feature.  Easy to use pouring spout.  The whistle fell off after 22 years of use and then it was a month after that the plastic melted because the whistle wasn't working and I wasn't paying attention.  Easy to keep clean - wipe it off when wiping down the stove after cooking."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,VERY PLEASED,"After having read the positive comments, I purchased the F5914 from Amazon and it was delivered this week.  I tried it today and I'm very pleased with the results.  Even though my den just needed to be ""refreshed"", I was amazed to see how dirty the water was.  I had brought home a Bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the Amazon comments were very negative so I returned it.  The only negative comment would be that the writeup in Amazon is not correct.  There was no bare floor attachment in the box.  I had to order one from the Hoover Store. But that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,the only sharpener you need,"I bought two five star Henckels knives: chef and paring as my first top quality knives.  I also got this steel to sharpen my other knives.  Like most new knives, the Henckels were ground to an edge, but weren't sharp from base to tip.  The steel sharpened them up beautifully in about five swipes on each side.  I've used stones, various types of sharpeners, and an electric sharpener in the past with somewhat positive results.  But this steel sharpens as well as hones or unfolds the edge, despite what they say about steels only unfolding and not really sharpening knives."

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great bargain,"10 of the most used items in basic household cooking. THis is the ultimate starter set. I'm a bachelor, and with this set, I can do anything from 4 pancakes at a time in the 12"" saute (I'll probably get the cdouble burner griddle eventually), to a single omelette in the the 8"" skillet. The 2 and 3 qt sauciers are exactly what I need for pasta, potatoes, veggies. They have a nice heft to them, and the non-stick coating has worked flawlssly. Keep in mind, eggs always seem to stick, even on the best non-stick, so use a little oil or butter with them. Highly recommended. Get a steamer insert, and the 6 qt piece is perfect"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Excellent slow cooker,"I'm a big slow cooker fan, and had a huge GE unit, which worked well until the lid broke. I quickly got this Hamilton Beach one from Amazon, and I'm very satisfied. No fancy stuff, just a basic cooker, but it serves that purpose very well. The quantity is just right for a dish for four. And it looks good too, with the exposed steel exterior and black crock. For this price, this is the best I can find"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Stainless Steel Strainer,"I have been looking for one of these for a long time.  I needed something that would gather more than a ""slotted spoon"".  I love it!  I highly recommend this strainer.  It works great in hot oil and water and I just pop it in the dishwasher when I'm done - no problem!!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,1.0,What the heck?,"I got this as a gift from Crate & Barrel and when I went to use it, I realized the holes on this tray are completely exposed. This might work ok if you're baking a *whole* pizza that has no chance of spilling/oozing over. It's definitely terrible for reheating pizza slices, as there is nothing to prevent the melted cheese from going through the pan and onto your oven. YUCK"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,4.0,COFFEE BY THE CUP WITHOUT PODS A MASTERPIECE!,"IF you think you need pods for coffee by the cup surprise you no longer need to be a slave to a selection of average coffee pods with proprietary interests that do not work universally on all machines. I am tired of pods that work on one machine but not another and none tasting fresh or full bodied. Here is the solution...Use the coffee you choose and load up the machine and make yourself coffee by the cup on your own terms. No pods, no fear of your pod system becoming obsolete if the machine maker goes out of business, no stale coffee. If you want average cooffee with plastic cups go ahead...but if you simply want single serve coffee without having to make a whole pot and no clean up issues but your cup ...welcome to the Cuisinart Demand"

The reverse side is designed for kneading dough. Again, no sticking! I am happy with the product, but have recently discovered plain parchment paper seems to work just as well(not for kneading dough though). I haven't had time to compare, but parchment seems to be the cheaper lo-tech way to achieve the same goal and can be torn to match the size of different baking sheets. Something to think about, eh"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,SiliconZone 9 by 12 inch small baking mat ,"Great product. This thin mat will allow for bottom browning on pizza which is what we use it on. The run off cheese never sticks, just slide it off on a cutting board and serve. It washes in the dishwasher and is very care free.  I have another brand that is too thick and does not allow the crust to brown on the botton and worst it is soggy.  Get the SiliconZone"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Ideal for braising,"This heavy-duty pot is ideal for braising, when food must be first browned or seared on a stove top and then finished in an oven.  The cast iron gets quite hot on the stove top even when low heat is applied, and it cooks uniformly in the oven.  I have made a number of meals that I would not have tried without such a pot.  The enamel surface cleans up easily.  This is an expensive item, but it is built like a fortress and gives the user confidence that it will do a good job for many years.  I strongly recommend using silicone potholders on the job, because the pot is heavy and retains heat"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Just sharpen the darn thing!,"This knife is actually quite a good value. The forged blade is full tang (the same piece of steel runs all the way through the handle allowing the manufacturer to adjust the balance by the thickness of steel in the handle)and is pretty nicely balanced. The Far East is making some darn good cooking utensils which means that serious home cooks on a budget can finally own very good equipment without the need for a second mortgage. I sharpen ALL new knives...even $200 ones. Once sharpened, this knife has turned out to be a good one. If you are itching for a Santoku, this is a good one. After you sharpen it"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Great roasting pan,"This pan is just the right size and weight for large roasts and turkeys.  The clean up was easy and although it is dishwasher safe, per the use and care guide, I didn't find it necessary.  I cook rib roasts using very high heat for 15 - 20 minutes depending on the number of ribs and then turn off the heat and let it set in the oven for a couple hours.  The key to this working is even heat distribution and even loss of heat as the oven cools.  It worked like a dream, no surprises.  I have other Calphalon pots and pans and have been a fan for years - this is no exception - excellent"

He has quite a personality believe or not and sits on kitchen table for the family to talk to him and he eats when we eat!  Very Happy fishy"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,A different kind of pan,"Okay, so the reviewers that call this pan ""low stick"" are right - it's not non-stick at all, but still somewhat less ""sticky"" than plain metal. Not mentioned is that it also has a bit of an odd feel when cooking...if you're used to plastic utensils, the surface almost seems ""soft"" with them. Metal utensils (yes, it's safe to use metal) sort of grab as well, also giving the surface a soft feeling. Takes some getting used to. "

kitchen & housewares,29 of 29,5.0,Great Price for a Great Pan! You really can use this everyday for everything!,"Let me start off by saying that my main cookware set is the Anolon Titanium set that cost $399 when we got it in 2003. I love these pans because they are heavy-duty, nonstick because of the titanium, and dishwasher safe because of the titanium.  Well, I wanted to add an ""everyday"" sort of pan to my collection because the Anolon set is VERY heavy and takes up lots of space, so I wanted something a little ligher weight for easier handling, but still large enough to cook for larger dinner parties AND easy to clean. So we looked at 12"" pans and skillets and we decided on this one, the Cuisinart Chef's Classic Non-Stick Hard Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Cover."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"great for wool rugs, upholstery","This is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go.  It's not a quick removal tool (think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming), but for things like wool dhurrie rugs, it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things.  It really does pull up tons of fur, even from deep in a rug"

kitchen & housewares,9 of 12,4.0,"Beautiful presentation, questionable price","I've used this grill/griddle at work instead of our standard grill due to it's tighter grill pattern. The ""bars"" are very close together compared to a normal grill and the presentation was BEAUTIFUL on petite 2-3oz filets. The numerous and tight crosshatch pattern was very appealing to the eye on the little medallions as opposed to the 2 lines each way i could sqeeze on the little medaillions. The tight pattern also means more contact area which equals more caramelization and flavor. I was so impressed, I went on amazon to see how much it would cost me to have one at home. I personally wouldnt spend the money, but I must admit that the presentation is beautiful. "

Either the nibs that hold the lid on break off or the plastic handle itself breaks and/or comes apart. After 1 or 2 times, this gets frustrating -- it seems to be a systemic problem with the carafe design. But, what do you do if you aren't willing to yet abandon the coffee maker and get another model?  You're stuck buying multiple carafe replacements over time"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,1.0,Broke the first time I used it!,"I bought the Good Grips julienne peeler because it was a few dollars cheaper than Kuhn Rikon's.  I tried it on potatoes, cheese, and cucumbers.  By the time I was done, it had twisted some of its teeth.  Also, it's really easy to nick your skin with this.  I'm wondering if the Kuhn Rikon julienne peeler would be better -- if there's some added quality that comes with the higher price"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Became an instant favorite,"As a person who has always loved using wooden spoons for cooking, I was really surprised at how useful this tool is.  Besides having a high heat tolerance, the best feature is its ability to reach effortlessly into the corners of saucepans.  With wooden tools, I've always had to make a special effort to get into the edges to make sure things aren't sticking.  With this spatula/spoon, that problem is gone completely"

I had this cookware at one time, and I can recommend it, especially for use on gas burners. Unlike Calphalon cookware, it can go in the dishwasher. However, to keep the finish gleaming, you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads. The 1-Quart Saucepan is a kitchen essential"

I will be replacing my failures with more KitchenAid mats"
kitchen & housewares,47 of 48,5.0,Looking for a good set of pots and pans?,"I have been a chef in the restaurant business. I can tell you that what we use in the business are not Emeril or Wolfgang Puck. We used commercial pots and pans which were unattractive but highly functional and made to withstand high heat and abuse. At home I have a set of Emeril cookware and a set of Wolfgang Puck cookware that were given as gifts and I love them both. I read the reviews that some people who call themselves gourmet cooks write about them.... that food is always sticking, the lid handles get hot and they develop stains! Really! First of all...the food doesn't stick if you learn how to use the pots and pans! If you can't get the hang of it you should go to a te-fal set. The lids WILL get hot, that's what hot pads are for! They will develop stains... you cook in them. If you want to display them to your company, that is what cleaners are for. Personally, I live to cook, I don't live for my cookware and even feel that a worn out pan is the sign of a good chef. I also own all-clad  and calphalon pieces. Unless you are rich and just have to have them... why? I never have food stick to either set, you just have to know and pay attention to what you are doing. Emeril and Wolfgang Puck sets are designed with the home cook in mind. They are well constructed, heat evenly and I have even had the fry and saute pans in the oven to better than 400 degrees without a problem, they saute, de-glaze and clean up like a breeze... what else could you ask for? Emeril cookware is made by the all-clad company and I can tell you I wouldn't trade mine for another set...why? They have lasted me forever, I have never had a problem with either set and if all you are going to be doing is some ""gourmet cooking"" at home, you can't beat these two sets! In comparison to my all-clad... of course the all-clad is top of the line in construction, but so is the price! I really can't say that the food turns out any better... it just feels better in a very expensive all-clad pan! I would highly recommend either of these sets to any home ""gourmet cook""! And... if you can learn to cook without the non-stick finish which is healthier for you anyway, you will never have to replace your cookware, ever"
kitchen & housewares,26 of 27,4.0,Some Like It Hotter,"As with many other products on Amazon.com, the ""Ultimate"" earned pretty much of a bimodal distribution:  People seem to basically love or really dislike the ""Travel Tumbler."" Either the quality control at Nissan is terrible (i.e., people are getting tumblers that differ greatly in quality), or the reviews themselves are just not very reliable.  Coffee lovers may be a pretty emotional bunch when it comes to their preferred caffeine delivery method, and some of the complaints seem steeped more in emotion than practicality. I'll try clarifying the bases of my own evaluation, which places the ""Ultimate's"" performance somewhere between the very good/very bad polarity I see here."

I searched soley for ""Electric blankets"" and when this came up over and over, I thought I would try it for the price.  It is NOT electric, but that is the category I found it in--and still find it in.  ""Queen size, electric blankets only.""  Other than that, it is way too expensive for a nonelectric blanket--and probably way too inexpensive had it been electric!  I just don't want anyone else to be mistaken.  It may work out, but I did not need another regular blanket and it is not very soft.  Good luck shopping"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Elegant fun,We purchased this to make sorbet for a dinner party that we were putting on for 15 people.  We were amazed at how easy it was to use this ice cream maker.  You freeze the cylinder and then put the ingredients in and after 20 minutes you have sorbet.
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,One of the best things to happen to baking,"I first discovered Silpats while I was in Culinary School and had a baking and pastry course. I was amazed at how well these things work. And after using them at school I had to buy some for my own home. You never have to worry about items sticking ever again. You can literally bake anything on these. I have used mine to bake cookies, biscuits, rolls, pastries, even frozen foods like pizza rolls and chicken nuggets cook up well on these. And you never have to use oils or cooking spray because nothing sticks. They are also easy to clean and store well. But I doubt you will ever need to store the Silpat because you will be using it all the time. So whether you are an occasional baker or bake all the time, a Silpat is an investment worth making"

They are actually too small for cereal if you would like to add fruit to your cereal.  They are perfect for oatmeal or ice cream but too small for soup or stew.  They are curved perfectly to drain and rinse well in the dishwasher.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great gift idea,I purchased one for myself several months ago and loved how smoothly it sliced through both vegetables and meat. I gave this one to my sister after preparing pizza toppings with the dull chef's knife she had. The 7 inch is a good size - longer and I find I want to put my hand on the back of the blade to steady it rather than on the handle where it belongs. Definitely go for the full tang and heft of this knife made of high carbon stainless steel. It holds its edge and has good balance. Just remind the new user that this knife is a thin cleaver and not a chef's knife that requires a rocking motion. It's not a difficult transition

I also own 2 of the Westbend Electric fondue pots. I am very pleased with how they perform. It beats having to change your heat source (candles or sternos) right in the middle of fonduing. I usually keep two for the dessert....melted dark chocolate with different fruits for dipping! I even take one of my fondue pots when we have potlucks at work. I usually volunteer to bring dessert and this has gotten to be a very popular item. I highly recommend this product

It doesn't suck all the smoke out of the way, but when she kept her cigarettes nearby or resting on the ashtray, it did hoover up the smoke trails. The 'smoking' room still smelled, mainly from her exhaling puffs of smoke, but after she left it didn't take quite as long to air our place out. Not smoking would be best, and something that draws in all the smoke would be better, but it helped and we were grateful"

I notice my cooking has IMPROVED as a result of using Le Creuset.  Buy it!  It is worth the price.

I love to use these dishes year round, especially during the holidays. I have had the dinner plates for at least 5 years and not a single one is chipped. All pieces are extremely durable and are dishwasher and microwave safe.  I regularly use my Botanic Garden baking dishes and covered casserole in the oven and on the table. The timeless design blends so well with all of my placemats, linens, other serving pieces and glassware.  I use a little fruit bowl each morning for cereal and I always feel happy. I don't think I will ever get tired of this pattern"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Easy to use and makes great coffee too!,"This is a GREAT coffee maker!  The coffee does brew a little faster than our old one & the timer works great...although another reviewer said that the timer clears out after each brew but we haven't found that to be true.  It saves the time you programmed last as long as you keep it plugged in, which we do since it gets used everyday.  The coffee tastes great, it looks good on my counter and the water fill lines are easy to read.  The carafe is large with a great easy-to-grip handle.  The only drawback is that the way the carafe is designed, it's hard to get the last bit of coffee out (just a couple tablespoons), although, if you turn the carafe upside down all the way, it does come out...it's just not convenient.  Other than that (which I am willing to overlook for all the other ""pluses""), I love this coffeemaker!  It's also really easy to clean"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Classic Teakettle,"Great Product. I would have preferred brushed stainless versus shiny, but that is a preference that does not affect product use.  It's a little cumbersome to open and close the spout (many prodcuts have a more ""user friendly"" mechanism).  In general, a good product"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,flimsy,"The non-stick surface is fine, but the pan is no better than what you can find at the supermarket: flimsy, light and therefore prone to hot spots. For $49 I guess I can live with the thing, because one does not use a non-stick pan for any serious cooking. If I had paid $149 I would return it in a heartbeat"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,2.0,Don't buy this one...,"It's about 50% plastic.  The filter is plastic, the handle is plastic.  I was really shocked at how cheaply this was made.  Get the other one for ten more dollars and get a stainless steel press and have the pot be completely glass"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Good solid product,I have this humidifier for 3 month now and running 24 hours a day. I have to refill water almost  twice a day for 1200sq ft apartment . It's been great so far. I used to get  rashes  and eczema  during winter- no sign of it so far. I woke up with no dry throat.  Easy cleanup- I wash it with mild soap and water once a week and no mineral buildup. You need to flip the filter upside down to prolong life. 
kitchen & housewares,24 of 63,2.0,Buyer beware.,"This cookware is NOT made by All-Clad.  This cookware is made in Korea (All-Clad is made in Canonsburg Pennsylvania, and is not up to All-Clad standards.  There is a big difference between this and the LTD line of All-Clad pans.  While this set might be better than, say, Farberware, it's not All-Clad. It's not professional cookware"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,A Cook's Dream.,"This is a wonderful pan.  I bought it to use in teaching my eight year old daughter how to cook.  It cooks evenly, cleans up in a snap, and works great."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,5.0,Excellent item! All in one! MULTI use!,I am very impressed with this product! I use it much more than I expected! I am even trying new items because it is so wonderful! Easy to clean. Very durable! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Excellent quality value.,"This is a sturdy, 2 3/4-inch pizza wheel, which produces clean, straight-through cuts on the first run every single time. Its smooth-running, beveled wheel blade never seems to need sharpening and its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional lightweight cutters do, and rendering it perfect for pizzas, pie crusts, dough, etc."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Iced Coffee,"I have been using the Toddy Maker over 10 years, after I moved south for awhile.  I was introduced to iced coffee and the cold brew method by a friend in Grad School.  I have been hooked ever since.  It is very simple to use and tastes much fresher than the concentrates you can by in the grocery."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Pot Holder,"I love my pot holders.  They are perfect because even if they get wet you can quickly wipe them off and use them again.  I've gotten more than one steam burn from my regular pot holders because I didn't notice that they had soaked up some water.  I've had similar problems with holding a pot for a long time with them but my regular pot holders have the same issue.  For that type of thing I'd have to recommend a pair of oven mitts.  They do take a bit of getting used to but if you hold them in a diamond shape as opposed to flat they are a little easier to work with.  So while I wouldn't throw away my old pot holders, I highly recommend these for your kitchen collection"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very handy Blender,I found this hand held blender very useful for many things in the kitchen. Very easy to use and powerful enough to chop frozen fruit and cooked vegtables. Love to make my own milk shakes with it.
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,A Phipps' Foam Mattress Rocks You To Sleep,"I was dubious about purchasing this air bed, however, I had relatives who were coming to visit and I had to buy something in a hurry. I am very glad that I chose this particular model over the others that I had been considering. It inflated quickly, as the manufactures claim. The switch that I used to inflate the bed allowed me to effortlessly choose whether I wanted it to be firm or soft, which is something that I greatly appreciated. Also, the bed was immensely comfortable. I expected it to feel like sleeping on a pile of unsteady rocks, instead, it was just as comfortable as my own regular mattress. Actually, it could be used in place of a regular mattress and prove to be very comfortable and economical as well as being easy to move. The inflating instructions were easy to follow and a patch kit was included with the bed in case of any leaks. Luckily, my bed did not leak so I was never forced to make use of the kit. Also, the bed came with a blue cover to store it in when it was deflated and a blue mattress cover to sleep on. The only difference that I noticed between the advertisement and the bed itself was the fact that the bed does not look exactly like the picture. However, I did not find this to be a problem. The manufactures shipped quickly and the item was well packaged. Also, I was provided with a tracking number through Amazon's order page and was thus enabled to know when my item was out for delivery. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and look forward to using it in the future.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I'm convinced,"After reading the positive Amazon reviews, I took the customers' advice and ordered 2 of these little pots.  I usually cook for one or two and these are an ideal size.  I probably want/need two more as with their included lids, they are perfect for small meals in an oven.  Follow the crowd and get at least two of these jewels. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great looks and performance,I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. The meals I prepare are complicated and often include a good amount of sliced vegetables.  I have two Santoku knives and have found myself using this knife more and more for my preparation work.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,BUY THIS!!,I bought this to sit beside a desk. It holds my printer/fax/copier combo. It is very sturdy and does not move at all during print jobs. It is wonderful quality. My desk is from a nice furniture store and they look like a matched set! &#60;br /&#62;
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,cute and easy,"The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it doesn't keep the tea warm for as long as I'd like.  But, it's cute, and dishwasher safe (easy to clean) and it kept it warm for a decent length of time"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Cool Bowl,"I never thought I'd gush about a mixing bowl, but this one is great.  I bought it as part of a deal with the Whirley Pop popcorn popper and I love this bowl.  This is a thicker and heavier stainless steel than all my other bowls.  Because it is heavier, it is less prone to move or tip over.  All mixing bowls are not created the same, and this one is clearly one of the best"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,What a pretty set!,"The flower detail is beautiful!  The thread count feels real nice after you wash it.  Great price, too"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 10,4.0,Lovely comforter set,I was very pleased with the quality but think they send a California King instead because it doesn't fit the bed exactly.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Not as expected....,"Setting up the bar was easy anf fast.We had it up in 15 mins.However the design of the bar is flawed in the sense that the bar can topple easily since it does not have any base.Also considerign we have carpet floors ,it is very wobbly.If only it had a base this would have taken care of the problem"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,CAN'T BEAT STYLE & DURABILITY FOR PRICE!,I have had my set for over 5 years.  The pieces get constant use and dishwashing and still look great.  I have damaged a couple of pieces due to carelessness on my part causing me to look for replacements.  I am so glad Hampton is still making this style because I have no interest in new flatware.  I just love these. I think they offer to perfect for both casual and more formal entertaining
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Deal!,"Fabric is thick, soft & cuddly--especially for the price (I received one free with my matching duvet cover.)  The color I selected, ""Milk"", was a soft white, exactly as shown on my monitor.  A great buy"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Red Hot coffee maker,I absolutely love it - stylistically it looks Great(red hot) and it functions magnificantly!!!!
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Love it!,I bought this from Crate & Barrel a few years ago and now they don't have it anymore.  It is perfect for making and storing waffle batter and baby formula.  The lid is wonderful since all my others cups don't have one.  I broke mine so now I can get it replaced
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good tasting water cheap and fast!!!,"This pitcher is a great choice when you want to safe money, room in your fridge and time. It's certainly good value for the dollars spent as well"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,4.0,Bred for bread,"I use this knife to take apart home-made bread or crusty baguettes, and to trim cake skin. The bread blade is the one getting used, the other one is still in plastic. No dead animals in my kitchen so nothing to carve with the other blade."
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Very disappointing,"I bought the Cuisinart for the name. Big mistake. After mashing the garlic, the little basket is consistently pulled out and PLOP! falls right into the food you merely wanted garlic in. So....if it falls into very hot olive oil, it can splash onto your hand and you have to quickly find something to pull the basket out of the oil. Bottom line, be forewarned----clever design in the boardroom, very poor design for the kitchen!   "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,timeless design,"This set of glassware is exquisite!  The timeless, functional design make this set one that will find a home in my kitchen cupboard for years to come.  The solid, heavy base lends a feel of richness -- but at a fraction of the cost of a designer series."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"very nice product, performs as I expected","I have had this immersion blender for more than six months.   It is wonderful for pureeing soups and sauces in the pot, eliminating the possibility of burning yourself when transferring hot items to the blender or food processor."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,lovely,"I use these as tea glasses. They're lightweight, very strong, and show the tea beautifully. The double wall design keeps the tea piping hot and my fingers cool. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,1.0,Try a different grater,This grater really does not work as advertised. Harder cheeses take forever to grind and soft ones get stuck in the grating tube. Try a different grater - this one ain't work the 20 bucks.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Henckels,"Very nice product.  Only one difficulty, cleaning the steak knives.  If washed by hand, the blades take part of the sponge or cleaning cloth and need to be rinsed a few times"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Umm Umm Good,"This pan is called the ""Cornbread Festival"" pan, but it can be used for so much more.  Baking Cakes, cooking fish, pancakes, and omlettes.  My mother used cast iron many years ago and I forgot how good it is.  Cast Iron has quickly become my pan of choice, I now have a whole set."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Switching from Teflon to stainless steel,"I ordered 3 of these stainless steel electric skillets last November as gifts for my mom and my sister (and one for myself).But since I spend half of the year here in Florida, I needed one for myself in this location.I purposely switched us all over from using a Teflon skillet to using stainless steel--as the reports about Teflon seem quite worrisome. It was extremely difficult to locate an electric skillet which was NOT Teflon but Amazon had the only one I could find. I am very, very pleased with how fast the orders arrived and with the skillet itself"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Faberware Select 10-Inch is a great purchase,"We love our new Faberware 10-inch skillet.  It's perfect for making eggs, grilled cheese sandwhiches and lots more.  It's SO easy to clean and the fact that it has a non-stick surface makes it easy to cook with as well"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,5.0,Fine glasses,"They are just the right size for tomato, orange juice or what ever your having for breakfast"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great for canning and everyday uses!,"Having our own garden, we typically can a lot of items every year. From dehydrated peppers to homemade strawberry jam, this is usually a long process. Typically we would have to boil every mason jar to get it sealed."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Cuisinart DLC-1SS Mini-Prep Processor,"This is a MINI processor, and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs, I have the ""big boy"" to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs, so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick, as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices, etc. however...but it states that in the manual"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,Happy cat factory,"In a household with 24 cats, (that's not a typo, there ARE 24) we are the perfect test ground for cat products. We bought the feliway spray, and a plug in to try to calm a couple of our more high strung cats. Most of them were feral at one time, a couple of them abandon and abused. I really had my doubts, but I admit I've seen a huge change in some of them. Our poor big Ghost has lived in the rafters for the two years he's lived here. The only time he would come down from the hutch would be to run to his box...and he would always be chased by two or three of the other cats. The stress caused I.B.S. problems, every two to three months he was on antibiotics. The day after putting the plug in in the kitchen, he ventured down to floor level, and went into the bathroom to nap. That was the first time he ever slept at floor level. That was two weeks ago, and each day he tries something new. He sleeps with my husband every night now, just loves the bed. Today I found him sleeping on the bed with 4 or 5 of the other cats...some of them his old enemies! He is our best sucess, several of the others are less aggressive, especially towards Ghost. There are still some small problems, but I am really thrilled with this product. I'm going to order my refill today."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,2.0,Get a machine with a removable bowl,"After owning a Simac gelato machine for over 25yrs we finally got tired of sponging out the bowl. The Musso is a similar machine, and will probably last forever just as our Simac has, but keep in mind that you will be sponging out that bowl forever as well. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 7,1.0,junk,"I've had 2 bread machines, so I guess they aren't know for durability. This one failed right out of the box. I sugest that you buy some one else's product......maybe one that isn't made in China"

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,1.0, Bad Product By A Good Company,It's that simple. 
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,homemade ice cream in 25 minutes!,"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also, I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender, pour it into the frozen bowl, turn it on, & 25 minutes later, you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 7,2.0,I got what I paid for! Fiestaware 1-qt pasta bowls,"While seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $4.99, I didn't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago. What a great price! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day. The packing is nice and secure. The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"A Powerful Fan for Hot, Humid Days!","This fan must have two pages, because I know I reviewed it last week; and at the time, it wasn't being offered by Amazon with free shipping.  If it had been, I probably would have gotten a second one.  I bought one last year from an online hardware store. It is a super powerful fan that works well on super hot, humid days. I've never felt a more powerful fan, except in places that use huge commercial type fans. It is loud, but I like loud fans. And metal fans do work better than plastic ones, in my opinion.  I recently got a 14 inch Patton high velocity floor fan with a plastic CVT blade, which is no where near as powerful as this fan. It's designed better, and is safer around children and pets, but even in the highest setting, it seems to me to be less powerful than this Patton on the lowest setting."
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,This is a must,The extra bowl is a must for families who like ice crem. I just wish it came with a lid for easy storage
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"Very nice, practical flatware","I have actually owned this flatware for about two years now, and wanted to give a review of the product over time. I loved the flatware when first purchased, and I still love it. It wears wonderfully, no noticeable scratching or damage whatsoever. The set is very stylish, and I always receive compliments on it when I entertain. I would recommend this quality flatware to others. I would also recommend purchasing more than one set."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,This is so simple,"I ran across this in a retail store.  Being an Oxo fan I bought one.  It is so simple I can't believe I never heard of it before.  You can peel 3 or 4 cloves in about 2 seconds (I'm not exagerating).  I love garlic, but it appears that I'll be using it even more.  I also bought the Oxo garlic press."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Simply the Best!,"This is truly the best all-around piece of cookware available anywhere.  It's low height, wide round shape, and heavy weight make it perfect for almost anything from stove-top cooking to long oven braises.  If I only had one pot in my kitchen... this would be it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Excellant buy,The dishes are beautiful and so affordable. We purchased the dishes for a friend at work and they arrived quickly. She is so happy with the multicolor dishware
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Discrepancy,"I can't say I don't like the saute pan, after all it's T-fal. However, this is advertised as a 12-1/2 inch and what you get is a 13 inch pan.  In addition, the &quot;features&quot; listed the glass domed lid, which leads the consumer to believe the lid came with it. Guess again, the lid is not included.  I've been inconvenienced for a month now trying to get this straightened out. Perhaps taking a minute to proofread what is posted might eliminate this from happening to another consumer that &quot;believes what they read&quot;"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Keeping it clean,"The GoldTone Filter is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to appreciate.  Not only is the filter easily cleaned--only a few sprays from the faucet cleans the grinds from the filter itself--but the filter allows for a smooth taste without losing any boldness or distinctness due to over-filtering."
kitchen & housewares,48 of 48,5.0,Good yogurt.,"I finally tried it out.  I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews.  I used 5 grams Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Starter (one packet, only) and 32 oz. whole milk following the directions on the back of the Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Starter package.  I ran the Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker for 7 hours to incubate the yogurt.  I think this is the best tasting yogurt I have ever had. "
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,High quality for a reasonable price,"I now own 12 full place settings in this pattern, including a serving set because of my appreciation for the quality of the utensils. They clean up nicely in the dishwasher and show no signs of wear, although my original set was purchased three years ago. Each utensil is properly weighted, which is something a lot of newer, stylish designs have a problem overcoming. The reason I did not give this set a full five stars is because there are occasional tarnish spots on the knives after being run through the dishwasher. Although it is a detractor, the spots are easily cleaned off. I firmly believe you can't buy a better quality set for the money"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Don't buy this poster if you want to sleep at night,"O.K., buy this poster if you like spooky things but don't say you were not warned. You are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around."

I am looking forward to using it on my deck this summer.  The add said I would get a TV remote saddle bag for my chair, which I did not receive, but maybe that was from another source"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Wait for a future model,"My husband and I registered for the VacuVin Instant Marinator for many of the same reasons as others did...for a quick marinate when we were on the run.  However, after a couple of uses, the VacuVin exploded in our refrigerator.  Yes, I'm sure that we must have 'pumped' too much air into the container.  But, there should have been some sort of 'limit' indicator.  Fortunately, it was a citrus marinade and wasn't too hard to clean-up.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Soft and inviting!,This cover came very quickly and was very easy to use.  I love the softness of the flannel.  The only complaint that I have is that the queen size is about 3 inches oversized on every edge so there is some movement of cover and duvet.  But that doesn't bother me too much as I'm sure it'll shrink a bit when I wash it a few times.  I love the snowflake pattern.  And the price really is great!  Thanks Amazon!

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Makes Bloomin' Beautiful Cakes!,"This Nordic Ware bundt pan made a beautiful cake.  This pan has a ten-cup capacity so I would caution new users to use about 2/3 of the batter of your full sized cake recipe in the pan and use the remainder for a couple of cupcakes in order to avoid overspill (I learned this the messy-oven way).  The cake rose well and uniformly; the batter baked evenly, the chrysanthemum design was clear and sharp when the cake came out of the pan, and the cake was a golden brown. The finish on the pan helps the cake to separate evenly from the pan without sticking, but Nordic Ware recommends ""Baker's Joy"" as a flour/oil spray-on and I agree with them that it is a handy product to use with this type of pan and it cuts down the time it would take to smear shortening and distribute flour evenly into the configurative design of the pan.  I usually top my bundts with powdered sugar or a glaze, but this didn't need any further embellishment.  I would recommend Nordic Ware Bundt pans to anyone who would ask"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent Cutting Board !!,"I don't usually write reveiws, but I was so happy with this purchase that I wanted to write one for this item. If you are looking for a wood cutting board this is an excellent one to buy. I love the round shape and it is an awesome quality. It has rubber feet on the bottom that keep it up off the counter and the handles work great for lifting it. It has such a pretty wood grain to it that it looks nice sitting on the counter. A very solid board that will last forever. Shipping was fast even with the super saver option! A great shopping experience"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Crispy Crusts,"This is the best pie pan that I have used.  It makes the crust crispy, and it doesn't stick to the pan.  Excellent quality and durable.  Be sure to get the 300 pies book with it..you won't be sorry"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Wonderful product and hyper fun to use!,"It seems lame to be so excited about this product, but I LOVE IT!  I got mine last week and I find myself using it all the time.  I read a lot of reviews and since so many were good, I gave this a try.  I am so glad I did.  I only need it to clean several rugs and a carpeted staircase and the battery holds up.  So far it hasn't run out yet and actually the battery life last longer than the dirt I have on my floor.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,It actually does what it says,After reading other reviews I had my doubts about the performance of this product but was plesantly surprised at the results. You must understand that this steam iron will not give you the same results you would get from your dry cleaner (their industrial sized equipment is the only thing that can do that). But what it does provide is quality bursts of steam that will make for excellent touch-ups on garments wrinkled during travel. &#60;br /&#62;

kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Below average coffee maker,This coffee maker is cheap and makes poor below average tasting coffee. Mine does not leak. The main problem is that it does not get hot enough. I like my coffee hot and the coffee I get in the pot is what I would call very warm but not hot. The search for a decent drip coffee maker continues
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Pretty cool for cutting pineapple,"Overall, I think this product is pretty useful and far less work than cutting pineapple with a knife.  I purchased the  version with multiple cutting sizes to accommodate different sized fruit.  If you find cutting pineapple a chore and have room for one more gadget in your kitchen, you will probably appreciate this product.  I really like this product for the quickness and ease of ""gutting"" most of the fruit from a pineapple.  However, it's effectiveness does depend on how ripe your fruit is and whether the pineapple is firm or soft.  If your fruit is pretty ripe and softening, then this product is a little bit messy and may ""crush"" your pineapple.  If your fruit is quite firm, you may feel like you're getting an arm workout.  But either way, with this item you can be snacking on the the heart of the pineapple fruit in two or three minutes - which is pretty cool."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,4.0,"Missing one of the most used, odd-sized measures. ","Although these measuring cups are nicely shaped, easy to use, and handy for melting butter on the stovetop, this set is missing one of the most useful of the odd-sized measures--the 2/3 cup measure.  Without it, the busy baker must twice measure 1/3 cup, a waste of time that is unnecessary with the appropriate measure."

kitchen & housewares,9 of 17,1.0,The incredible shrinking shaker!,Bought this as a gift for a friend.  Am buying a different one as a gift for the same friend.  There is a basic design flaw as most materials shrink when exposed to cold temperatures.  The lid fits INTO the base of the shaker.  Fill it with ice and cold gin and the base shrinks.  Thus the lid is STUCK.  You have to wait for the ice to melt and the base to warm up in order to pull off the top.  That seriously cuts into the number of martinis one can consume in an evening.  Not worth the under twenty bucks price
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Great Timer!!!!!!!!!!! ,"I decided to purchase this timer, since I didnt want to go to Home Depot, Lowes, or Ace to purchase one. It has a nice size display (easy to read) I had no trouble setting the time an timer (very easy to do IMO). Its grounded unlike many comparably priced Timers, which is great (as I have it on a 2 ft Fl fixture for a small fish tank), depending on the plug you instal it on itll cover one outlet completely an enough of the second plug so that it cant be used (not a problem if your using a power strip).

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Terrific for one or two people,"This is my eighth or ninth purchase of this small grill. I'm a very lazy meat-eating body builder, and I love this grill. I use it three times a day for hamburgers, lamb burgers, liver, and chicken. Liver and chicken are a bit dry in the grill, but hey, I'm too lazy to cook them any other way. The meat burgers are great; they taste great and there is an unbelievable amount of fat that runs off. It takes about five minutes to cook a burger, scrape the grill a couple times and give it a rinse. I keep it right next to the sink so I can rinse it easily. The grill only lasts about six months for me because I use it so much. The teflon starts to peel and it suddenly becomes impossible to clean. But at under $20, I'm happy to throw away the old dirty grill and replace it with a new one. This small model can handle two hamburgers just fine. "

kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Wonderful Product,"Our family uses our waffle maker at least one time a week.  I purchased this machine from amazon last valentines day for my wife.  She was pleased.  Our favorite is whole wheat pancakes.  It takes 3 min 45 sec at 4500ft altitude to make 2 waffles.  The kids put bluberies in the holes.  The prices was $300 and I would buy again for that price.  Customer service has been great.  The only flaw in the unit is the nob to control the time to cook the waffles.  It is made of cheap plastic and sticks out.  The first time it broke was when my wife picked up the machine and bumbed the nob.  We called Kitchen Aid the they sent us a new unit. ""We just wanted to get a new nob."" We sent the old one back and a couple weeks later I broke the nob on the new unit pushing the machine on the counter. Use caution when moving the machine.  All said, I am glad we have this waffle maker.  "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,The Best Small Spatula--A Kitchen Essential,"This Le Creuset Small Spatula is so useful--in cooking, with small pans, and in scraping jars and bowls. The colors are bright and pretty. You can keep the whole set of different size spatulas in a matching Le Creuset Poterie right next to your cooktop. I like that I can remove the head of the spatula, put it in the top level of my dishwasher, and sanitize it, especially after I have used it to make something with raw eggs. Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,1.0,NOT MADE TO KEEP THE BUGS OUT!,This storage container looks good that is about it.  And it really isnt that cute.  The design is all wrong.  The top breaks off the back hinges.  The small black thin rubber that is suppose to help seal the container. Doesnt do anything.  You will have every bug and mouse imaginable getting to the food and having a party.  I was better off stapling my bags of Pet food closed than using this container
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,In 15 minutes I had lucious ice cream!!!,"I purchased this machine at the local Salvation Army for $2.97. I was so excited to get it home. But saddened when I looked at Amazon for reviews and was disappointed to see all the low reviews of this machine. I almost didn't try it. But one review stuck out... It basically said to READ THE DIRECTIONS! So I printed off the manual online (mine did not come with a manual or a box) I followed the directions to a 'T'. I froze the canister overnight in my coldest freezer. I made the Old Fashioned Vanilla Ice Cream recipe in the manual, I made the first part and chilled it for SEVERAL hours. Added the vanilla and whipping cream just before pouring it into the canister.  I didn't want to just sit and watch it so I set the timer for 20 minutes and got online to check mail.  After 15 minutes I heard the machine struggling a bit. I went into the kitchen and I had lots of fluffy ice cream! I could have let it churn a bit more if I wanted to add some cookies or strawberries, bananas, etc.  This is what I have learned:"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Exactly the right tool,"I've used it to break up chocolate, crush tortilla chips, and pulverize eggshells (for the garden). In fact, for everything except pounding meat. But I'm sure it will do a great job at that when I get around to trying it."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Looking for excellent results? Look no further.,"Received product yesterday and haved used it four times already.  This little machine is quality through and through.  It is made with sturdy, solid metal parts.  No junky plastic that self destucts after two days.  I want everyone to note as previous reviewers have mentioned, this ice crusher requires a good amount of strength--it is not for everyone.  The handle must be turned with a good deal of force, or as some would say, some good old fashioned elbow grease.  It will sometimes jam & seem to be stuck, but all that needs to be done to remedy that problem is reverse the handle in the other direction for a split second to loosen the piece of ice.  I personally put my hand on the top of the machine after I feed about 3 cubes into it. After about 10 seconds, presto!! perfectly crushed ice.  I must confess, I am a muncher too.  The ice comes out the perfect size for munching, as well as cooling off your tall iced tea in seconds.  I believe this machine will last for years and is well worth purchasing. I love the stylish look of it too.  One last tip--don't waste your hard earned money on the automatic or electric ice crushers--they are useless, aggravating & make mush, not crushed ice.  I learned that the hard way. I highly recommend this product.  Enjoy!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Easy to Use - Fantastic Cleaning Machine ,"I rented the Rug Doctor to clean my area rugs on Memorial Day weekend and by July 4th weekend my carpets got dirtier in that time period than they got in their first two years. I think it was due to the soap, although I rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after I used the rug doctor soap. I was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because I was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again. This machine is easy to use. I had absolutely no problems with leaking. I did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet. I used two scoops of Oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses. No problems whatsover. My carpets got so very clean. It extracts very well also my rugs dried fast. I am so happy that I purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at Amazon."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,1.0,Don't buy this,"I got my canister as part of my original purchase of a food saver.    With in a matter of weeks it was cracking.  It became useless because of the cracks.  When I emailed them to complain I was told I had to call it in to their service desk.   I explained that due to a recent injury I can't talk.   That I needed to use email, TTY or instant messing.   I was told that I should get a neighbor, friend or family member to call.   I'm checking the laws to see if that is a violation of the law.   I believe it is a violation of the handy access law.  But it doesn't matter it's just wrong.  I will never buy another and you shouldn't. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,1.0,Great Product-Horrible Battery Life,"I manage a retail store.  I wanted to rate this product with 5 stars.  I rated it with 1 star.  Reason why I wanted to rate it a 5 is because of the many uses it has.  It is very handy for our big display windows and the smaller areas where you can't get a vacuum in.  Very portable and great attachments.  The main reason it got 1 star is the fact I have to throw away a perfectly good DustBuster because I can't replace the batteries.  The batteries don't seem to hold there charge after a year of use.  We do wear the battery completely out and recharge it once in a while.  This helps any rechargable batteries life extension.  I am not going to buy another Black &amp; Decker, or any other DustBuster that I can't replace the batteries in.  It's a waste of money and adds to the useless waste in the world.  Until I find something else, I will use the plug-in vacuum we have to replace once every 4 to 5 years.  Less waste and cheaper"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,Works great while it works,"This product does an excellent job of chopping everything from nuts to cheese.  But, after only a year and a half of light use, it quit working. The blades still spin, but it no longer is capable of chopping anything.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Great steam, good espresso, minor design flaws.","STEAMING: This machine delivers very powerful continuous steam production. It is not an exaggeration that it steams enough milk for two cappuccinos in under 20 seconds. In fact, in terms of continuous steam production, this machine flat-out outperforms a professional machine with two E61 groups that is used in coffee house owned by a friend of mine. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"Nice, but not perfect","I purchased this to replace an older cheaper Copco teakettle, primarily because of its design and ease of use to pour.  I like the shape which seems to put more water closer to the heat making it warm faster, and I like the way the kettle opens when you lift the handle - however, the kettle lid under the handle is cumbersome to use, so i end up filling it via the spout - yet the spout lid doesnt open very wide so I have to really pay attention to what I'm doing otherwise I'll just get water running down the outside of the kettle."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,A great investment,"This cookware is fantastic.  It heats evenly, cleans easily, seals well...it performs well on all accounts.  The pieces will last and last.  To give you an idea on durability, my grandmother has a set that is remarkably old.  She still cooks in it to this day.  My mother has a set that was a wedding gift over 30 years ago and she still loves it.  Between the two of them, my sister who owns a set as well as myself, I think it's safe to say that we all love this cookware.  I cannot recommend Magnalite highly enough"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,1.0,Can't be used AT ALL on the stovetop!,"After only 8 months, the Teflon started to bubble off the pan and after contacting KitchenAid (who, to their credit, responded very quickly) I was told that the pan CANNOT be used on top of the stove, even just for making gravy.  What kind of a roaster is THAT, I ask you???  They will replace the roaster but now I think of it as merely a lasagna pan with a rack.  Or a roaster that can be used only if you scrape all the drippings out and into another pan before you make gravy."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,The pan is very unstable barely stand on its own on the stove,"The pan is a very dangerous thing in my kitchen. Without food or lid with the pan, the pan is very easy to tilt over, user please  careful with oil on it.  This is a very small pan, good enough for doing your egg.  You cannot saute (with a shape like this) or and is too small for stir-fly.  One of the reason that this pan will tilt over because it is too SMALL - a small body with a big handle"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,This will be used a lot,"After much indecision, I finally opted for the non-stick grill pan and it is wonderful.  It is easy to clean and doesn't take up much storage space, in contrast to the electric grill I have been using.  I have used it for hamburgers and they are done just right.  I can also toast the buns right on the grill as I cook the meat.  I look forward to many future pork chops, bacon, hamburgers, steaks and chicken, all done on my grill.  I used to use an iron skillet but the grease had no where to go."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,"HUGE, high-quality stockpot","I did not realize how huge this stock pot was until I made a double batch of soup and it only filled up the pot half way.  Despite its size, it heated the food quickly and didn't scorch on the bottom.  It cleaned up very easily, though I can't imagine it would fit in anyone's dishwasher.  I washed mine by hand, and that was easy enough.  Great stockpot for large batch stews"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 16,1.0,This pan is poorly designed,"Bottom line : if you are looking for a grill pan, this unit is not it. The ridges are sharp, too high, and not rounded. At best it steams the meat, maybe more healthful vs. less oil?. Meat sits too high above the heat base and juices. Hence it pumps out atomized oil and vapors like a chimney, not good. I have had much better results with an anodized aluminum square grill pan(reason for trying a cast iron grill pan), but refuse to use aluminum long term (not healthy). Best!! results are with my standard flat bottom cast iron pan. After a 2 weeks, went back to the flat pan and the meat is much much more flavorful. Don't waste you money. I have to wonder about some of the other reviews here (bad cooks? phonies?), it is obvious per stated design this pan is A DOG"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 15,1.0,Henckels....,"I am really disappointed in this product - I feel Henckels tries to trick their customers by providing lower quality products under the same label.  I understand that the logos are different, but many people buy this set believing they are getting quality German knives for a discount, when in reality they are getting a cheap set of knives that should cost maybe $20, but because of the name are paying $80.  As a sales rep and manager for the number 1 selling cutlery brand in the United States, I can say that the reason we outsell Henckels 4 to 1 is because we are completely honest with our customers"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,4.0,Nice kettle; Color didn't match.,"I bought this kettle in tangerine to match my tangerine kitchenaid mixer, but i was disappointed when i opened the package and found that the color didn't match!  The kettle was not as vibrant an orange as the mixer.  I ended up returning the kettle, and buying the same one in stainless steel, which i am very happy with. The whistle is not obnoxious like many i have heard, and the spout opener is easy to use and keeps your hands away from the hot steam.  The only negative is that because it is such a heavy duty kettle, it takes longer for the water to heat up than in a cheap, lightweight one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,4.0,Handy grilling accessery,"I have two of these little sauce pots. I put them on the barbecue while I am grilling.  The sauce or melted herb butter stays hot and there is no messy dripping because the pot is right next to the items being grilled.  I only gave it 4 stars because the directions say not to use soap, just water, to clean it.  You have to use soap to get it clean.  It doesn't hurt the pan.  Just dry it quickly and oil it before putting it away"

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,Fresh out of the box,Took the blender out of the box. Cleaned the jar and lid and started trying to use.  It ran for a few seconds and then I started smelling something burning and the blender quit.  I attempted to contact customer support and couldn't get through.  The telephone message suggested I leave a message and they would call back.  I attempted to leave a message but it said the mailbox was full.  Not a good sign
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Perfect for enchiladas or lasagna,"I love to cook, and I love to watch cooking shows on TV.  You cannot watch food tv for very long before encountering a certain someone using a Le Creuset product (you know who I mean).  Wanting to try one myself to see what was so special about this line of cookware, I purchased this rectangular dish.  Needless to say, I am thrilled with this purchase!  The quality of this casserole is superb.  For its size, it is HEAVY and seems to be very well made.  It heats evenly, looks great as a serving dish at the table, and cleans easily.  This was the perfect &quot;starter&quot; to my collection.  I would recommend this purchase to everyone, and I am sure I will be buying more Le Creuset in the future"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Gadget,"I love this gadget!!! It's great and works really well. Plus, when people see it; the response is ALWAYS - ""Wow, how cool is that?"" They must have had a hiccup with production; because I had one that wasn't as solid but then I recently sent one to a friend and it is a little workhorse.....so it seems that the people that make them changed something to make sure these things last. They also have great customer service and make sure you're happy with the product."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,A pure delight,"I received this as a gift from my Husband on my 30th birthday. It had caught my eye a while back so I was very excited to get this and set it up. I have kept Betas for over 3 years now and this is the most attractive bowl I have ever used. The LED light is quite soothing at night and does not emit any heat that is noticeable to the touch. It also compliments the colors of the fish nicely. The tiny screws that hold the top in place can be tricky but once screwed in provide a very secure top that will prevent the fish from jumping out and the holes on top make it easy to feed the fish. Overall, I think this is a very classy item and will highly compliment the beauty of the beta fish! "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,1.0,Pan snaps out of the spring brackets when kneading,"Machine reviewed is TR2500BC. Some of the other reviews are for different models, so watch out when reading."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,2.0,Design Flaw,"The unit I have has a design flaw. When the coffee is brewing and the basket fills with water, instead of tripping the control to let the coffee flow into the pot, it instead fills to the top of the basket and flows over and then all over the counter. Only half of the coffee gets into the pot. My husband took a plastic spoon and broke it in half and stuck the straight end in the front of the basket which fixed it in some way. Unfortunately, I do not have the receipt so, I am now stuck with this sorry thing that has had to be rigged in order to work correctly. I am very disappointed in this Mr. Coffee product as I have used Mr. Coffee products all of my adult life and I am about to be 55 years old. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Better than candy and flowers,"My wife (who has been a tea lover for over 30 years) used a tea press for the first time at a Quetzal's restaraunt a few weeks before Valentine's Day and was blown away by the delicious improvement in flavor.  So, for Valentine's Day I gave her this press and a bag of Mother Earth's Organic Earl Grey loose tea (I mean, how many years can you give candy and flowers?).  She loved it and has been enjoying it every day since"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Worst Coffee I've Ever Made,"I got this as a Christmas present last year, and I thought the idea of it was nice, seeing as I'm a working college student who's always on the run, and I was the only coffee drinker in the house at the time.  Well, my first problem with this coffee maker was the filter.  I usually bought pre-ground coffee, but that was too fine, and I ended up with grains in my coffee.  I had to buy whole bean coffee and get it ground so it was less fine.  My second problem was the mug. At first,I couldn't figure out why the coffee I made tasted really awful.  I tried several different kinds of coffees, expensive bags too.  But then I realized,it's the plastic inside the mug. Believe me, you can taste it.  I'm sure I could have found a better mug to use with this machine, but at that point, it had become too much of a hassel and I went back to my ol' faithful Mr. Coffee.  Sorry, maybe I'm picky about my coffee, but I like it strong and black, without a bit of plastic mixed in"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Surprisingly amazed & delighted, perfect cookies","This is my second and LAST cookie press purchase. This gadget saves so much time when baking cookies, crackers or parmesan bars, I now bake more than my family needs, or wants. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Indespensible container,"I use this container daily at work instead of a coffee mug.  Every morning, it is used to dispense two servings of black coffee into my mouth.  If I get called to a meeting or wander away from my desk, my coffee will still be plenty hot when I return. My brother, mrkiker (see other review) introduced me to these, and I couldn't be more pleased.  I've used it as a can cooler as well, and it does a great job there too"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 36,5.0,Bit a better Brita,"They work; I have two, one outside the fridge 3qt (coffee, tea, cooking etc.)and one in 2qt (drinking water, diluting juice, etc). A few people have mentioned a some shortcomings or gripes; here's my take on those problems."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,JUST WHAT I NEEDED,"This is just what I was waiting for.  I have always found the OXO brand to be well made and reliable.  I was not disappointed in the function, quality or price.  Would recommend to anyone"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Great little food processor!,"This machine is beautiful in red, it looks great on my counter.  The machine works perfectly, when I pulse it gently pulses the items slowly and gives me a perfect chop.  I used this with mushrooms and onions and celery and each item was chopped to perfection as I orchestrated the pulses.  Then I took some eggs and put them in with some chopped basil and hit the on button and voila beautiful whipped eggs.  This is a great machine.  I have even got perfectly ground almonds and graham cracker crumbs.  Buy this beautiful little jewel.  It works great and makes minimum noise"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Very impressed!,"Perfect for making baby foods.  My mom, who is quite picky about kitchen appliances, really loves this product. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,It's fabulous,"Love it!  We were replacing a 12-year old Braun coffee maker (which is still working!), so the Braun brand name was a plus for us.  The coffee tastes better.  We love the gold cone filter and were happy to be rid of the paper variety.  The machine runs well without the Britta water filter in place, but we enjoy that feature and use it.  We also like the programmable turn-on/shut-off feature and the coffee is REALLY hot"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,I agree with Tim,"I have an antique Ng and Taylor carbon steel wok that has worked incredibly well for 30+ years.  Round bottom so I can scoop food up the sides when needed and when I turn the heat off, the heat starts to go away.  I tried cooking on a friend's Lodge wok and the meal was almost over by the time it heated up and it was still hot when people started going home.  I love cast iron, especially Lodge, but woks should be carbon steel and not cast iron or non-stick"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,excellent set great price,"great quality. lids lock and seal nicely. perfect for box cakes, bake it, let it cool, then put the lid on and put it in the fridge."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0, QUALITY ALL THE WAY!!!!," THOU I,VE ONLY USED IT ONCE SINCE GETTING IT,OR SHOULD I SAY MY SON USED IT IT,S WORTH EVERY PENNY I SPENT ON IT STURDY NOT TO HEAVY!!! AND JUST THE RIGHT SIZE.DRAINS WELL AND CLEANS UP WITH NO FUSS,LATER ON I,LL PURCHASE THE 3,QUART ONE. I RECOMMEND IT OVER THE PLASTIC ONES OR THE BARGAIN ONES,YOU,LL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE!!! AND I FELT IT WAS PRICED RIGHT BEING OF STURDY STAINLESS STEEL"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,4.0,Great service!!!,"I ordered the teapost and received it within two weeks, but was disapointed when I noticed it was chipped.  I notified amazon.  UPS picked up the package the next day and the day after I received the new teapot.  It couldn't have been easier or faster.  Thank you"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,great box,"This is a great invention...no more scooping daily, much less smell, much less mess.  We have one cat & empty the recepticle weekly.  Yeah, the poop stinks when the recepticle is in the trash, but duh, it's cat poop!  Take the trash out.  The litter does stick to the rake but not enough to stink or really accumulate.  We did have the cat tent also, but it didn't really improve smell & didn't seem to ever fit right.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great dinnerware!,This is the first time I have purchased fiesta dinnerware and I love it! The cobalt blue is beautiful. I purchased two four piece settings and received two more settings for free! The dishes were very well packed and shipped quickly.  I will definitely be adding to this collection!
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Churchill China,I love the set. It is not from England but Columbia.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Very loud whistle,"The kettle looks great on the stove, and the water heats quickly.  The tea is always just at the right temperature when it comes out.  But... the whistle is VERY LOUD!  The cats get quite frightened, which is kinda fun, but I find myself bolting over to turn it off to save my eardrums - or, I just wait in the kitchen until the water is ready."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,25 years and counting,"It's hard to find something new to say about Le Creuset that all other reviewers haven't. So I'm going to focus on clean-up and sturdiness. One of my favorite uses for this pot is polenta. That's right: nasty, sticky, constant-stirring polenta that sticks to everything and hardens to near-stone status if not cleaned immediately. I make a batch about once a week and keep it in the fridge for quick meals or snacks. Once the Le Creuset pot has cooled, I put it in the sink with a little Dawn and warm water and let it soak, then use a plain old plastic scraper for the tough bits and sponge off the rest. And that's it."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,Almost perfect,Let me start by saying two things:
kitchen & housewares,1 of 8,2.0,Product image doesn't make the real product,the pan in image looks bigger than the real pan I got.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Best torch value,I bought this torch in spite of some of the negative reviews because I actually tried it in a store. It was well made and had an easy to light trigger and consistent flame. Not sure what other folks were doing wrong.  But I found it to be very good and easy to use.  Very good value too!  I recommend
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Snapware storage set,"I am using the set to store perishable goods.  I think they are perfect for that purpose.  I was actually looking for something like this, only I had requested glass cannisters, for the search.  I didn't realize they were plexi-glass.  Which is fine, I'm using them and I think they are perfect.  Thank you for your sight, which has a lot of very neat things"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 18,2.0,The item you receive is NOT an MIU France model,"I'm a little frustrated on this purchase.  I wanted a food chopper, and settled on this one, thinking it would be better quality (and not made in China) than a lot of similar models available from competitors.  What I received was a generic chopper in a generic box that just says ""Chopper"" on it with no instructions, and it is made in China.  The picture is the same as shown on Amazon, but there is NO reference to MIU France ANYWHERE on the box or item itself."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,I can't say enough good things about this knife!,"This knife is very heavy, &amp; is perfect for slicing &amp; dicing. It is very sharp, &amp; will cut through anything with ease. I plan to buy more of knives by this manufacturer. I have a full set of Calaphon cookware, &amp; you can't go wrong with this brand. It has a full tang, &amp; a lifetime guarantee"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Smaller than a mandolin, perfect for soft fruits/veggies","I bought this as a clearance whim in Target once and have loved it ever since!  It's small, easy to store, and works really well.  You have to &quot;saw&quot; the tomato, and be sure to keep your fingers out of the way!  I'd buy one for someone who really likes tomatoes on their sandwiches or tomatoes with basil, oil, and mozzarella.  If mine ever breaks (going on 6 years) I'll be sure to purchase another one"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Fabulous knife,"A total pleasure to use and a super value for the money. I heard about it on Americas Test Kitchen and they certainly were correct. It's become my favorite knife and I have some very expesnive ones, I highly recommend it..!!"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,These really aren't that bad,"My husband and I bought these sheets (in the color Sage) from a department store when we moved into our new house and have had no problems with them.  True, they are sort of wrinkly after washing, but I find that as long as you put them on the bed directly after they are done drying they are not nearly as wrinkly and they would be if you let them set in the dryer a bit.  "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Great bowl for teenagers,"This is the best bowl for teenager portions of cereal, ice cream or spaghetti. They also make good fruit or candy bowls to set on your counter. I do want to warn people that the photos colors for persimmon are too light on this website; the actual bowls are a medium red/orange. I knew this before I ordered it... You can't beat the price free with a four piece setting. We love it"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,This Thing is a Hit - With Adults and Children Alike,"Fun. It's easy to use and everybody loves it. It makes having an ice-cream treat into an event. It takes about 2 1/2 minutes to make each cone, so everybody can gather and participate while the house fills up with fantastic smells. Rolling cones is easy and even the failures elicits laughs (and taste great). I've used the Chef's Choice mix and the recipes - all good."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Best Birthday Present Ever!,"After doing extensive research my husband gave me the B60 for my birthday this year and I have to say that it is one of the best gifts I've ever received!  As a new mom that has returned to work everything is about convenience and the lack of preparation or cleanup that's associated with the B60 is perfect.  It provides a great-tasting, steaming hot cup of coffee or tea in about a minute and I love having the variety of pods to choose from every time I make a cup.  During a recent visit my in-laws tried our Keuring and loved it so much they purchased their own when they returned home.  We recommend this to everyone :-"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Crockery rainbow,"It's all true: Fiestaware is classic, colorful, beautiful, colorful, durable, colorful, microwave and dishwasher safe, colorful and just plain wonderful.  Buy some!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Like dining out while at home,A fine piece of equipment.  I was able to reproduce the same quality as if one were dining out.  The unit produces a fine array of sanwhiches and can grill a variety of other foods if one has the desire.
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Nothing sticks to these pans!,"I bought these pans on a whim, but I've been thoroughly impressed with them.  I've made cookies on them, and I've used them as drip-catchers for other dishes, and everything washes off completely!"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Excellent Value: Quality Sheets at a Bargain Price!,"I purchased these sheets at the Amazon Friday Sale and received them on Monday. I am very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the detailed workmanship. The flannel is thick, luxurious and produced very little lint when pre-washed. The fitted sheet is elasticized all the way around and deep enough to fit a thick mattress. The flat sheet is hemmed on all four sides and the pillowcases are long enough to hold a queen sized pillow. I plan to order the twin size for my kids rooms. At $12.99 (shipped), these queen size sheets are an excellent value"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,5.0,well yes they are small,These are awesome dishes.  Yes they are small and so perfectly suited to certain uses.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Incredible,"Both my husband and I love this scoop, it really cuts through the ice cream and does a super job with not a lot of effort. Incredible and amazing, I highly recommend.  I bought this new one to put our old one in an RV - this one definitely stays in our kitchen for regular use"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Don't hesitate...buy this pan,"This pan has become my most used piece of cookware. It grills anything from fish to vegetables with nothing falling in the grate or falling apart because I couldn't control the heat.  It is large enough for fast meals for four.  I grill salmon two or three times a week.  I like to get a crisp, but not burned, grill marking on the fish, and this pan does it perfectly.  I don't even use my hard-to-clean JennAir grill parts anymore, and I haven't felt the need to replace my broken outdoor grill.  The nonstick is great...no burning and easy, easy cleanup even though the pan surface is not even.  I like the stay-cool handle also.  The exterior hasn't gotten discolored, but I have used Barkeeper's Friend on other pans without scratching.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Good but overpriced,I like the product but Amazon should leverage their buying power to reduce the price to customers.  I was disappointed to see it go for 12.99 at Costco a week after I got it from Amazon
kitchen & housewares,1 of 19,1.0,delevery time poor,Takes orders and does not have them in stock. Will have to wait 2 mths to get me order
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Fantastic Design *Kudos to Farberware*,I have Le Creuset and Calphalon pots and pans but I find myself constantly reaching for this Farberware pot.  The design is why I bought it.  I would have been willing to pay $100 for one just like it from Calphalon or Le Creuset but this is the only one of its kind I could find anywhere online.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,piece of junk -- melted while cooking egg,"would NOT recommend.  After using for less than 2 months, one of the spatula already melted while cooking an egg.  The spatula melted while I was trying to get it under my egg to flip it, so it wasn't even on there for that long.  Now we'll see whether they stand behind the lifetime warranty.  But if I were you, I would just save yourself the hassle in the first place"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,great toaster,"the cuisinart toaster works great and looks fantastic. the only thing it doesn't have is a setting that toasts the bagels a different doneness on each side. the setting it does has, just extends the toasting time for the bagels."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Waste of time and money.  Piece of Junk.,"This is my first review, but please save your money.  The vacuum is too much work being bagless and is messy.  I'm going back to the bag.  It's always breaking and the knobs are cheap.  Mine just broke off and I've only had this for 6 months.  Im going to take this thing back.  I thought Hoover was top of the line, but this thing proves otherwise.  I wish I had returned it the first month"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Black and DeckerHandy Chopper food chopper,Works great - use it for lots of things like chopping up chicken and cheese. 
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Pyrex 1.5 Quart Glass Loaf Dish,"I have tried both metal and glass loaf pans.  I always return to the pyrex.  It cleans up perfectly, doesn't scratch or dent, can go in the dishwasher.  I have used pyrex for years.  Metal products have been discarded; pyrex is still in the cupboard"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Nice fan with temp. glitch,"The fan does its job. Before we got it we did a lot of research, and it was hands down the best choice for the money. All the functions work pretty nicely EXCEPT the digital thermostat, but not to worry - half of us don't even set it up. For the other half you can do the same thing as I did, like I said we read the reviews on it and every one said that the thermostat is the main draw back but some one actually took it apart and supplied the detailed instructions how to move the thermo wire away from the board, I did it in 20 min., so if you are a handy man then there is nothing to it. Overall we are happy with this fan."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Scotch Eggs and my DiLonghi ROTO Fryer,"I produce many batches of Scotch Eggs each Christmas season, and have tried many types of deep fryers..."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,great reliable coffee maker,"Owned this coffee maker for over 5 years now, been happy since day one."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,pitcher size appropriate for one or two cappuccinos,If you are making your cappuccinos one or two at a time this picture is fine for those that drink their coffee Italian style.  If you prefer a more American style cappuccino (1/2 milk and 1/2 espresso) the capacity of this picture will hold enough milk for one good sized cappuccino.
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,A paperweight not a can opener,"It looks like you either love it or hate it. Well, of all the consumer items I've purchased during the past 20 years, this is the worst. It just doesn't do one simple thing, open cans. Oh, it might open one out of five and that is generous. I always keep my handy dandy hand opener which I bought for $4.95 at the market handy. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Functional, fun, and beautiful","I wanted durable dishes, definitely lead-free and I was hoping to find something that looked nice. They pass the durablity test being restaurant quality. Function was more important than design, but these dishes are so beautiful! I intended to buy two sets to have a little variety. After my first set arrived I ended up ordering four different colors in all. They are so cheery. I love the simple design and deep  vibrant colors. The web site pictures do not do the color justice. It is fun to mix and match them and they frame food so nicely. All sets arrived in good condition. One set had flaws on the mug's glaze. Amazon is handling that professionaly, quickly, and without incident. Make sure you look over each piece for flaws in the glaze."
kitchen & housewares,20 of 29,2.0,NOT for professional or anyone who has actually ironed for years,"OK - i saw all the great reviews for this product and against my gut feeling that this was too good to be true - i brought it.  Well, it does remove wrinkles - however, not in the manner that i'm used to with an iron.  I've been ironing for years for work and the steaming quality is just not up to par with an iron.  Yes, it will remove the huge wrinkles, like if you leave your shirt in the dryer or if you left it in a ball, but it does not do the next step that an iron does - of making your shirt look crisp and sharp.  This is what no steam can do and what i should have realized.  No, i'm not looking for a pressed shirt from a steamer, but the faint wrinkles and unevenness left in the shirt are NOT acceptable for any professional."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,I feel so spoiled!!,"this coffee machine and gift pack is something I really didn't NEED but my daughter raved about it so much I purchased one too.  Now I am spoiled with the best, freshest, coffee in the world each morning!  Easy to use, no waste, FAST and FRESH...what more could you ask for?  I LOVE it. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,GREAT!,It easy to clean! Need I say more? its durable and flexable not to mention it looks great!
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Works Flawlessly,"This is my first vacuum food sealer.  I had thought about purchasing one for years, but wondered whether I would really use it, given the expense of the bags/rolls, etc."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,another excellent product from Calphalon,"I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware.  Best set I have every owned or used.  Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots & pans."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Just the right size,"This nutmeg/ginger grater is just the right size to grate small amounts of hard, grateable ingredients into a bowl, saute pan, or sauce pan.  It fits into the palm of my hand and is easily grabbable from the kitchen cupboard right above my mixing area. I had been looking for the right nutmeg grater for months, and that's what I'll be using it for, but it will probably work for parmesan cheese and ginger root as well"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A perfect steak at 10 below zero!,"The first time I used the grill, it was 10 degrees below zero.  I was absolutely amazed (along with friends and family) on how quickly the grill heated up in the cold and cooked our 1"" steaks within 12 minutes total cooking time!  I love this grill, and keep it just outside my patio door for winter cooking in Anchorage, Alaska.  Now I can bar-b-que all winter long.  Thank you for this amazing product!  Vera DeLon"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Your Own Personal Assistant (In the Kitchen),"For years I balked at the cost however, after replacing two underpowered poor-performing handmixers over the years, I took the plunge and purchased the KitchenAid Stand Mixer. My only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner! This mixer has provided me with four years of hands-free use, with predictable power and consistency. It makes wonderful lump-free batters, stiff meringue, smooth frostings, perfect whipped potatoes, and even kneads bread dough. The included recipe book is a perfect introduction to it's array of capabilities but don't hesitate to let it take over other chores in the kitchen. There are a multitude of tasks the mixer can perform with optional accessories that are available for purchase. Turn last night's roast into today's sandwich using the meat grinding attachment, churn out authentic fettuccine with the Pasta Attachment, prepare fresh juice using the Juicing Attachment, it can even open cans and mill grains. So many possibilities...and all with the quality and classic styling you would expect from KitchenAid"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Wonderful Set!,I love these dishes!  The color and glaze is beautiful.  I bought 2 sets.  One arrived damaged but Amazon was great about picking up the broken set and it was replaced very quickly.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Convenient and fast - but be sure to have lots of counter space!,"I really like the GRP90WGR Next Grilleration Removable-Plate Grill for the ease and convenience of being able to ""grill"" for the whole family without having to step outside.  I thought it was a fair price, and I really like being able to remove and wash the grill plates in the dishwasher.  In fact, that was one of the biggest selling features for me.  As far as the five different plates go, you'll probably only use two of them, the two grilling plates.  They are great for hotdogs, burgers, bacon, and such.  The other baking plates just don't do it for me.  While the grill is the perfect size for grilling for a family, you need a little more room for things like pancakes and eggs than the lower baking plate offers.  It is not a substitute for a real griddle or even one of those square griddle pans because it is a fairly small rectangular plate with very high sides.  The recipes included suggest switching out plates while you cook, but you are supposed to let the whole thing cool in between; it would take at least an hour to properly prepare a simple two course breakfast if you did all this!  One final thought about all the plates - at any one time, you have three just sitting around not being used.  Where do you store them so they don't get scratched up, but you can still get to them easily?  This is another reason that I never use the other three plates - I had to store them in a cabinet, wrapped in towels so they wouldn't get scratched by each other.    "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,they work fine as  long as you prep them properly,I have always used the water filters and had no complaints.  Just make sure you soak them for a few minutes and run a few cups of water (no coffee) through your coffee maker when you put a new one in.  This will eliminate any stray charcoal in the first pot of coffee you brew with a new filter
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome set!,It really has everything you need to get started in the kitchen. I have been using this set for about two months (switched from Magnalite) and I absolutely love it. Buy the 6 qt. saute pan and maybe the 4-1/2 qt. pot along with it and you have a very complete set
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Exellent quality prep bowls,"On tv all of the celebrity chefs always have a ton of prep bowls.  They make cooking look easy and fun.  Have you noticed that their prep bowls do not have measurements?  These do.  In fact each bowl has two measurements.  It marks halfway into the bowl, and then gives you the full bowl measurement. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,4.0,Does most things well,"Top quality sllicer.  Cleans like a dream.  Only problem I had was in slicing fresh bread, the slices tended to catch on the plastic blade protector.  Other than that It did all things well"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Perfex Peppermill,"Just decided to pop 'Perfex' into the Amazon search engine on a whim, and was very pleasantly surprised to see it pop up.  I've been using my trusty Perfex for years (bought it in Boston, actually), and have given many away as presents to friends, who are always delighted with them.  Lightyears past the various Peugeots, advantage no. 1 over all others is the easy loading (and changing) of pepper(s), independent of the very precise adjustment of the grind.  Only caveat is that with time (like 20 years!), the spring weakens a little and you might have to adjust the nut somewhat more often.  But they last forever and work...simply.

kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Horrible experience with this toaster oven,"It was impossible to actually toast anything without drying it out like a piece of jerky.  Jerky toast - that's what I want in the morning!  This was a problem from Day 1, but I thought that I'd solve it by turning the thing on for a few minutes before putting bread in for toast.  Occasionally this was an acceptable strategy, but many times the oven would shut off the top element.  "

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,This product deserves no stars,This pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread.  For the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster I have ever owned.  It is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,MAN IN THE KITCHEN,"I am a graduated Chef and have used many different types of cook and bake ware.  I will say right now that no person who cares about how their cookware and bake ware looks and works should ever use a dishwasher.  I personally think that the look that hard anodized cookware gets from marking and oils on the exterior is very beautiful and shows the use and passion you put into your cooking.  If you want something that looks perfect then buy stainless steal from all-clad and clean it immediately After every use and use a stainless steel polish weekly.  Nothing lasts forever, so take pride in what you have"" For best non-stick results in cookware at a price that is affordable, buy a set of Cook's Essential's cookware From [...] they work very well and offer every style/type and the warranty is incredible and very fair.  Happy shopping and peach to all"

Zymox Otic has solved the problem, keeping their ears nice and clear and clearing up the infections they had when I started it.  Be sure to use it daily at first if they have an infection. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Eureak Atlantis Express is junk.,"Bought a Eureak Atlantis Express to clean up my couch which had some stains. It didn't work right even before I even turned it on. I filled the clean water tank with water and put it back into the unit, exactly as directed in the instructions. It LEAKED water through the vents at the bottom for the motor. So I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I tried it again, and it leaked water through the motor vents again. Its like it is missing some extremely critical parts, which it probably is. I havn't even turned this piece of junk on and I gonna return it. Dont waste your time or money on this machine"

kitchen & housewares,17 of 18,5.0,Great  machine. Pasta has good texture with durum flour.,I have had a Simac Pastamatic for about eight years. I have owned several other brands of pasta makers. Most of the ones I previously had were not well made. They were all made in China or Taiwan. I do have an older 700 Pastamatic and it is made from a stronger and more flexible plastic. I prefer the older Pastamatic because I believe it is a better machine. I use either semolina with bread flour or all durum flour. All durum flour seems to work very well. I bought a new farmer's pasta die from Simac and I really love the texture.I recomend it if you are a pastaoholic like me. It's the closest you will ever get to commercially extruded pasta

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Terrific for the price but watch your diet!,"I have had this only a couple weeks and have already gained two pounds.  In one 18-hour period I consumed (as frozen custard) 3 cups of whipping cream, 3/4 cup of sugar (at least I used turbinado), one cup whole milk, and four egg yolks.  Incidentally, that is my favorite recipe so far...I added a generous amount of vanilla and heavenly doesn't begin to describe the result.  Sigh.  Won't be doing THAT for a while"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,"Works ""Great"". No ""Smells"". ""Perfect"" rice.","I just got my ""Sanyo"" ECJ-D100S 10-cup rice cooker. I love it. The ""precision"" is ""awesome"". I cooked my usual ""rice"", ""pepperoni"", and ""mixed vegetables"". They turned out ""perfect"". Better than ever. I've had one of the ""basic"", single mode, ""dumb"" rice cookers for years. They work alright, but, take my word for it, ""fuzzy logic"" matters. This Sanyo with it's fuzzy logic thinking makes decisions that a single switch cooker doesn't make. Also, and I was ""sniffin"" like crazy while it was cooking, ""NO BAD SMELLS"". I think the people that have reported bad smells just didn't remove the ""shipping paper"" that is between the ""inner pot"" and the ""heating element"". They don't want to admit it that they ""screwed up"" and didn't ""un-pack"" the unit correctly. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,really good deal!,"Sheets are so soft after the 2nd wash.  I actually like these better than the Heavenly bed sheet set that I've been using.  They fit my queen pillowtop (thank goodness).  The sateen is not too shiny, which fits my preference and is a good thing since the sheets do get a bit wrinkly.  All in all, a terrific deal for the price"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Glass with Class!,"These are the perfect glasses for our kitchen. The clean, sleek look of these glasses make them a very classy addition to our table.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Forget the Instructions,"I recently bought one of these pasta makers.  The instructions were horrendous.  I either had a drop of water too much or a pinch of flour too much.  The pasta was either too dry to extrude or so full of moisture that it came out in a lump.  I was breaking the dyes right and left.  I used a basic pasta recipe called Trenette: 2 1/2 cups unbleached-all purpose flour, 1/2 cup semolina flour, 1 teaspoon fine salt, 2 large eggs, and 1/2 cup filtered water.  Using sea (kosher) salt and filtered or bottled water was very important.  The sea salt enhances the taste of the pasta greatly, and I found that ordinary tap water left an undesirable aftertaste. You will find that this dough is very elastic and not as yellow as the basic recipe for pasta.  I first put the eggs, water, and salt in a food processor and mixed the ingredients thoroughly.  I then added the semolina flour with the food processor still running.  Next, I added the unbleached flour a tablespoon at a time until the dough formed a ball and was rolling around inside the food processor with the sides of the bowl remaining clean.  I then took it out and kneaded it a couple minutes, and put it in a covered bowl in a warm place and let it rest for 5 minutes.  I then put it in the pasta maker and after it had kneaded about 5 minutes, I let it extrude.  I came out easy with great texture and consistency.  I have eaten a lot of pasta in my days, but this was the best that I have ever eaten.  Good luck and enjoy"

kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,Shower curtain rod saves day,"We have a narrow tub/shower, and had a glass sliding door.  The water was leaking out under the door and under the tile floor causing lots of problems.  We stayed at a hotel that had this shower curtain rod. It bows out in the center, and gives you lots of elbow room in the tub. We were happy to find it on Amazon. It was very easy to install. No more leaking water, more room in the shower, and we added a pretty shower curtain to spruce up our bath"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I. Love. This. Lid.,"It's a bit strange to be going off on how great a LID is.  But if there ever was an occasion, this is it.  I had somehow collected 3 10"" Calphalon skillets; none of them came with a lid.  I registered for the 10"" lid from Target, but they stopped carrying it, so I ended up buy this one online, despite the $25 price tag.  It was worth every cent."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 8,2.0,Things Stick!,"I have tried to follow the Cuisinart instructions but things like eggs, pancakes, and steaks all stick to the cooking surfaces regardless of heat level and coating with cooking oil.  I would not buy this set again.  Sorry for the negative review but I am not happy with this purchase.  I recently bought other ""non-stick"" skillets to cook things like pancakes...  "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Lodge Pre-Seasoned 7-Quart Dutch Oven,The quality of this items is great!  Pre-seasoned is definitely worth the few extra dollars you pay.  I think I bought one a little too big as I like to cook roasts in the oven and have a large family - but it's so heavy (20 lbs)!  It cooked wonderfully though when I used it! I would definitely recommend the product - just beware of the strength it takes to lift it
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Very disappointed.,"Twice I followed the recipe for basic bread and ended up with an inedible result.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great Product,"I have only used these 2 times since purchase (We bake a lot more during the cooler months), but they are very easy to use and clean up is a snap. It's a drag washing small items like these but they really are easy to wash. I like the fact they are reuseable. That was a big selling point with me. I see my family using these a lot in the coming months"

kitchen & housewares,54 of 54,1.0,Very Disappointing!,"I was skeptical about the quality of these pillows at such a low price but the reviews were so positive that I thought I'd give them a try anyway.  Upon receiving them, I'm led to believe that the reviews are actually for a different pillow in the Pacific Coast line.  I did not have high expectations because I knew they were feather, not down, but I found them to be heavy and dense.  But worst of all, the &quot;special finishing that makes them leak proof&quot; CRACKLES because there is evidently a layer of plastic/vinyl which serves to prevent the feathers from poking through.  Oh well, I guess I should have know better... I'll be returning them"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,first loaf was perfect,"My unit just arrived today and I opened it up, quickly read the instruction booklet, threw in the ingredients -- and 4 hours later out popped a perfect loaf of bread. I'm impressed. Sure, it's just one loaf -- and we'll see how it goes as I try different recipes and the unit ages. But right out of the box, it worked perfectly"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Beautiful set!,"I have been looking for years for a Thanksgiving dinner set that didn't cost hundreds of dollars!  This set is beautiful!  It has a nice weight, dinner plates are on the small side...but heck...thats what seconds are for right?!  The teapot is darling!  Serving pieces are great!  All you need is the gravy and the platter and you have dinner!  Also, you cannot beat this price...ANYWHERE!

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Total nightmare of a blender,"I am surprised at how well everyone is doing with this model.  Maybe I got a dud, I don't know, but my Wave Station is garbage.  The plastic container has two pieces, which I could not dislodge from each other.  Therefore, I could never entirely clean the thing.  Worse, the other parts are similarly difficult to remove when following the assembly instructions.  I never got it to work right; it would not crush frozen strawberries for a smoothie."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 12,5.0,Brings back happy memories!!,Smaller version of soda shop mixer but just right size for my kitchen. Quality product for price! Fun to make malts and milk shakes with it. Chrome finish looks nice
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Lovin' it!,"I really like the electric skillet. It cooks evenly and is easily cleaned. There are 7 of us in our family, and I use it to cook bacon and eggs, french toast, pancakes, fried potatoes, fried chicken and much more! It is the perfect size for those with large families. We also take it camping with us, and it great for grilled sandwiches, heating up tortillas, or just about anything. I hope it lasts a long, long time"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Corelle Ultra Radiance,"I love my new dinner ware.  The colors are great and fit in well in my kitchen.  They do seem to be a little heavier than other Corelle sets; but, not as heavy as stoneware.  I wish there were serving pieces and accessory pieces but they just offer the 4 pieces.  I am supplementing them with white and white trimmed in colors featured in the pattern.  As these are my every day dishes, that is not a problem.  These pieces are much lighter weight.  The 4 stars is because of no additional pieces.  I would recommend them"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,DON'T ORDER THIS,"The spoon is chipped with black marks all over it. Also, the picture shows four spoons but there is only one. It's an over priced piece of junk with inflated shipping cost. I'll never order from Restockit again"
kitchen & housewares,61 of 61,2.0,substandard item,I had this product for 5 weeks and it has officially stopped functioning.  Trying to get customer assistance from Sunpentown is worse than pulling teeth. I do not recommend this product
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Not the Cuisinart I have previously owned,"After using a Cuisinart for nearly 30 years this newest model is terrible. My others lasted years and this one less than one.  The 11 cup processor mechanism that activates the motor is not aligned, therefore the motor won't start.  If I fiddle with it the motor will start for a few spins. It is hard to get the top off. All in all a huge disappointment. I am no longer brand loyal, and will bite the cost and buy a new Kitchen Aid."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Super Quality!,"I really love these sheets. I got them just the other day and immediately washed them and put them on the bed. The first thing I noticed about them was the fitted sheet. Of all the sheets I own, the fitted sheet in this set really sets the mark for quality. Not only is the fabric generous (sides extend all the way down the sides and well under the bottom of the mattress), but the construction is also super sturdy, with elastic all around. My favorite sheets, for style, are the Calvin Klein Bamboo Flower ones, but I have always been frustrated at the low quality of the fitted sheet--it fits well around the corners, but barely covers the sides. And over time, it's just gotten worse. With the solid construction of these Pinzon sheets, I'm betting that their quality will be upheld through the years."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,5.0,Cook's little helper,"I decided to purchase this gadget after seeing a professional chef who appears nightly on FoodTV.  He recommended it for baking purposes.  Since then I have found many other uses for it and am thrilled with the purchase.  It has a lot of surface area for scraping or gathering chopped foods.  The handle is nice and fat without being cumbersome.  This is not an overly sharp tool so don't expect it to cut like a good knife.  It cuts pastry dough and soft, thin foods nicely and is great for scraping your dough board.  I keep coming up with new uses for it so I'll probably end up buying another one soon"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Works great  -- holds at least 30 lbs,"I think this product is terrific.  my dog (white german shepherd) is a VERY picky eater, so once his food even starts to lose its freshness, he won't touch it.  i used to store his food in an old square Rubbermaid container, which was definately not air tight.  his 25 pound bag of food would go bad about 2 weeks after i bought it (which was only about half the bag's worth).  "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,A great addition to the Calphalon pot racks,"These sturdy hooks lock in place and are quite secure, allowing more pots and utensils to be stored on the rack.  The hooks are easily moved from one place on the rack, to another, when the needs present themselves"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,4.0,KitchenAid Mixer,"I have enjoyed my new KitchenAid.  I'm thinking that I may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter, as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater.  Overall, I am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 12,1.0,Do not buy Delonghi product,"Despite the high price, my roto fryer did not work from the day one.  The basket rotates when you first turn it on but it always stops working.  Apparently, a lot of people had the same problem.  Also, they don't have service centers in every state, so if you have a problem, it's going to be tough and expensive to get it fixed"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Restaurant Quality Rice at Home,"My wife and I became busy recently and decided it was time to finally get a rice cooker to save some time in the kitchen.  We bought a cheap old-school rice cooker and the rice would scorch, water would boil out of lid, and the rice was worse than cooking the rice on the stove top."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,better than allclad,"I've bought several brands of frypans, saute etc from the most expensive(Sitram is absolutely the best) to All Clad to cheap stuff. I wind up throwing out most of the low end pans after a short time and have been pleased with All Clad, except for there pricing. I took a chance with Emeril reluctantly just because I think so little of his cooking schtick. But wow the pan is great. Everything All Clad is at much less"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,makes mincing easy,"I really love using this knife!  It makes chopping/mincing/preping so much easier.  I always wondered how the chefs on TV did it so quickly. now, I realize it's the knife."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 5,2.0,Has design flaws ,"I have owned this blender for about 6 or 7 years now, I purchased it because of KitchenAid's reputation for making quality products. About a year ago two of the rubber teeth that couple the motor to the mixing blades, broke off. A couple weeks ago two more teeth broke off leaving only two remaining. I'm sorry but a blender that costs $100 or little more shouldn't have such a lousy drive system that doesn't hold up over time. Another poor design IMO is the jar's handle, it is attached with spot welds. I was expecting the handle to break off by now but oddly enough its fine but I still think KitchenAid should use rivets and replace the rubber drive system with something sturdier that will last for many years. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,5.0,LOVE this,I got exactly what it said it was and it arrived quickly and in great condition. It has every cutting implement I could want and it is all very good quality. I am completely thrilled. It is a very good buy for the money and I was impressed.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent tool for cooks at any level.,"This is my fourth electric skillet in 35 years of cooking, and the first one I'm making excuses to use.  Despite a kitchen filled with Le Creuset, All Clad, and Calphalon cookware, there are times I just want to stand at the counter and not at the stove to prepare dinner.  This is a beautiful piece of equipment, nice enough to bring to table, and with a capacity spacious and deep enough to accommodate a large cut-up roasting chicken with potatoes and vegetables (which I did last night for first use), or for browning and then braising meat for a stew.  There are no hot spots, as I've experienced with other electrics, so the even heat provided quick and even browning of all chicken pieces before braising.  Also delightful to watch your dinner's progress through the tempered glass lid.  A small steam vent keeps the lid from jiggling under too much pressure.  I'm looking forward to doing a brisket in this skillet, as my round Dutch ovens could never handle the shape of that cut of meat and I had to use a roasting pan tightly sealed with foil.  It is quite large - larger than I had expected, and just barely fits on a shelf in my kitchen cabinet.  But nice enough to leave out on your counter if you must"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Be Careful When Ordering,"I am very pleased with the dishes but there is a problem with ordering. On the Amazon.com screen, it asks how many of the item you want to order; I selected 8 because I wanted 8 plates.  The particular vendor the item was obtained from, sold them in boxes of 6 (Acehardware,com).  I was shocked to receive 48 plates. When I explained the problem to the vendor, they were very nice and told me how to return the ones I did not want. It cost over $32 in shipping charges to return the items which didn't make me very happy after paying shipping charges for receiving the items"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Different glaze on red mugs,"I ordered all three colors of these mugs - red, blue and white.  The blue and white mugs have a shiny, even glaze.  The red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish, giving it a more rustic, country look.  The mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really don't match each other. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Sweet,This little machine turns out quality espresso in about 5 minutes.  I have used it 3 times a week for a year and it works just as good as it did the first day I received it.  Quality machine for the price

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Lower quality than authentic receptacles!,"I have owned Littermaid products for many years.  The last time I purchased receptacles, I bought this 18 pack.  When they arrived in a plain brown box with no actual Littermaid box, I should immediately have suspected they were not from Littermaid and were nowhere near the quality.  These receptacles are NOT Littermaid-quality receptacles.  I normally buy the 12-packs from Drs. Foster and Smith (online and catalog) or PetSmart, but I liked the idea of the 18 pack, since I now have three cats (lots more waste, since they like to ""compete"" in the litterbox).  Trust me, if you want to reuse your receptacles or not have to struggle to change them when they are a bit on the full side, buy Littermaid brand receptacles and not a cheaper but much lower quality knockoff.  I am switching back, because I much prefer quality over quantity"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Iced Tea Set,"If you are looking for an iced tea picture set, for the money you can beat this.

The glassses and picture are just the right weight"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect Italian Espresso!,"If you're looking for a good, and mess free way to enjoy espresso at home, then I highly recommend Illy ESE pods! I use the Illy medium-roast pods with my Briel Multi Pro Espresso machine. The pair produces such good tasting, Italian cafe- style espresso everytime! It is not bitter nor acidic. You get full bodied and velvety espresso consistently.The crema produced is thick and quite beautiful. And of course if you want to make capuccino, all you have to do is froth some milk! How easy is that! For Italian espresso lovers, this is one great buy"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,BAM!!! What a great frying pan!!!!,"First and foremost, let me say emphatically that I am NOT a chef. I'm not even a very good cook. Heck, I don't even watch The Food Network! But I do like a good value for the dollar, and I'm sick and tired of replacing skillets every year or so. So, one lesson I've learned in life is that you get what you pay for; therefore, no more $9.99 frying pans for me. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Review below is NOT true! A very nice pan.,"The ten year warranty is voided after dishwasher use only with Calphalon's hard anodized cookware, not the stainless. Read your instructions again, and really you should be washing your pans by hand anyway. I just purchased the pan today, and have only cooked one egg (over medium, perfect!)in it as a test. Turning was a little difficult because of the deep sides, but I bought it primarily as a stirfry pan anyway. All in all, a very nice pan for the price (so far)."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Spatulariffico!,"It really IS that super duper heat resistant.Unfortunately a smart-alecky friend &quot;tested&quot; it for me. The spatula's fine. I got the sharp-looking black one, and it neither melted nor became discolored"
kitchen & housewares,38 of 49,5.0,I love these discs!,Each disc speaks for itself concerning its abliliy and uses. NOT ONE DISC HAS LET ME DOWN. The greatest part about buying the set it not just the savings you incurr from the bulk purchase but knowing that you will never be in your kitchen wishing you had the bought the whole package  vice one disc at a time. You will have all that you need
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Best Timer I've Ever Owned,"This timer is well worth the money.  My kids use this timer to time themselves while doing homework, taking turns on games etc.  It's very simple to use, and is sturdy and dependable.  The ring is loud enough to hear from another room, and the digital display is big and clear.  The triple A battery is easy to replace.  The magnet on the back is handy for keeping the timer on a file cabinet or refrigerator.  The magnet is strong, so that the timer doesn't fall off.  I already have 2 of these timers at home, since the kids and I use it so much.  It's convenient to have one in the kitchen, one in the playroom, and one in the office, so  I'm thinking of buying a 3rd.   "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Handy Book Light,"This book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person.  I use it with the converter so I can plug it into the wall , but the battery adapter works well for travel.  I have also used it to read in the car. I wish the wiring was a little heavier, as this was where my former light failed, but it lasted for several years with regular use"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,it's okay,"My wife and I juice at least once, and at times twice daily.  We had an inexpensive juicer so I spent a good deal of time reviewing models before I purchased.  Several people recommended the Omega 4000 and I narrowed the choices to this one or the Breville Elite which was eliminated as the height was too tall to fit under our upper cabinets."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,2.0,Smoothie-making's not for wimps.,"The goal may be a ""smoothie,"" but the means requires a rough and tumble machine capable of pulverizing and liquefying hard ice.  After going through several blenders, I was given this Back-to-Basics ""dedicated"" smoothie-maker as a gift.  Not only did it appear to be flimsy but it's proven in less than two months to be woefully inadequate to the task.  Granted, I failed to follow all of the precautions (pour in liquid before adding ice, use the stirring stick to keep the ice from jamming the blades) but, trust me, this item isn't made for going the distance.  The rubber gear teeth that engage the blade began to strip during the first week and by the 8th were completely defanged.  In some respects, I'm relieved to put the machine out of its misery.  It was both slow and messy (of what practical value is a plastic spigot?  A decorative device requiring extra cleaning)."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great shakers!,"What a nice addition to your table!  They're quite pretty and very easy to grab, especially for those with arthritis and for toddlers, without them spilling all over the place.  They look really ""retro"" and can start quite a conversation at the table.  I've found them to be just fine, size-wise, but you do have to refill them quite often.  Great product though - goes from the table to the dishwasher (top rack) without problems"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Product!,"This product is just the thing for special occasions. It allows you to make the whip cream way ahead of time (even days if you want) and not have to worry about at dinnertime or after. Because it is under pressure, your cream stays fresher longer. Also, it is especially great for those who would like to have whip cream today and later in the week. It does not loose its volume and turn to soup like if you were to whip it in a mixer and use it a day later. The only problem I have is not having enough for a large group. Thankfully it is so easy to make, sometimes I will make it again when the first batch is gone. This takes all of about a min. or so to do. Warning: Be on the look-out for the CO2 cartridges at your local stores because they can really range in price. Usually specialty cooking stores carry it but it is not the best buy there as a general rule. Always keep enough on hand because it's usually a holiday when I realize I am out (stores aren't open!)"
kitchen & housewares,34 of 37,2.0,Zyliss Large Salad Spinner,"While this salad spinner has a fairly large capacity and is relatively easy to operate, I feel it does not spin the lettuce as dry as the one I previously owned.  (It broke and I  can't find the same one.)  As a result, I need to spin the lettuce several times and there's still water clinging to the leaves.  Because of this my salad dressing is sometimes watered down (which I really dislike).  I'm disappointed in this item and I'm considering ordering another salad spinner from another manufacturer.  This item is definitely over-priced and does not perform the way I'd expect a Zyliss product to perform"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great combo...mixing bowl and measuring cups in one...perfect for pancakes!,"Great quality with solid sturdy handles.  The larger ones can be used as mixing bowls themselves which then makes pouring out of them an even easier job.  We use these for mixing pancake mixes, and then pouring from them right onto the griddle.  Classic Pyrex workmanship and quality.  Highly recommend the set"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,Can't use with DLC5 unless ordering adt'l part,Amazon recommended this accessory when I bought the DLC5.  After receiving it I found that the spindles are permanently attached to the shredder and slicer blades that came with the unit.  (I'm not sure how you store those very efficiently!)  Now I have the adt'l slicer blade with no spindle.  I have to do some research to find a spindle see if it will fit the DLC5 food processor.  I'm in limbo
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,Worst brand of bakeware on the market,AirBake products are horrible! I have used the cookie sheets multiple times and I have had nothing but problems. There products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans. I have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than AirBake. Buyer beware! If you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"""Easier than Pi...neapple""","This little gadget is great.  I never used to buy pineapple because I hated preparing it to eat.  Now it's simple and quick.  I'm glad I bought several of these, because I'm going to give them to my sisters. I know they'll love them also.  We are always looking for great gadgets to share with each other, and I've found a great one!!"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,5.0,"Great Product, Great Price","These tongs by OXO are very functional and safe to use on non-stick cookware.  I highly recommend these to anyone who, like me, uses non-stick pans.  If you watch cooking shows, you will see these tongs being used by the chefs there too"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,Warning! Do not purchase this product.,"I just purchased this filter and it is much smaller than the filter basket of the coffee maker. I thought it would fit snugly, but it does not. There is a gap between the outside of the filter and the basket. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,1.0,This teapot doesn't whistle-  just looks pretty MOD,"I 'm writing this review the day after Xmas 2005.  We wrote on a family pollyanna we wanted a ""whistling tea kettle"".   A relative gave us this.  I just used  it to make my  favorite tea- Barrys Irish.  The person who wrote the last review was right-  it DOESN'T whistle!  Also the lid doesn't go down after you press the lever.  I had to manual squash it down.   I followed the directions- I mean this isn't rocket science.  The whole point is to get a sound so I know the water is boiling.   I am going to be donating this to the thrift store  and buying another brand that DOES work.  We previously had a Revereware kettle that worked until the whistle part fell out and down a black hole in the stove.   I am sad because this clearly is a defective  product and should not be  sold as a whistling kettle.  I wish they had a no star option on this review.  I let  it pass for one star because I liked the chartreuse  green color"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Quality and Elegance,"Not only did the pots and pans exceed my expectations aesthetically, they also seem to be more than just another cheap cooking set; I have had them for over a month now and they've performed more than adequately- the non-stick coating seems to be of high quality as well. My favorite aspect of this cookware set is the innovative straining function of the lids..."
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,2.0,Shipped Broken,Can't say much about it other than it was shipped to me with one of the arms broken off.  How do you screw that up
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Grill/Griddle,I have been using my Grill/Griddle regularly since it was purchased and I am very pleased with it's performance. I really like the temperature control unlike using my foreman grill.  It is great for grilling everything with ample room.  It's fits in my Kitchen Aid dishwasher but it is so easy to clean that it usually doesnt get to the dishwasher.  I shopped all the brands before buying and found this one to be the most convenient and versatile. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,A Great Little Gadget to Heat Water for Tea,I can fill up this little tea pot and in less than five minutes have enough hot water to make four cups of tea.  No guessing the temperature as is often the case with heating water in microwaves.  And the automatic shut-off makes it great for the office
kitchen & housewares,23 of 23,5.0,Pasta Drying Made Easy!,"The Norpro Pasta rack is great!  What I like most about the  drying rack is its easy to assemble, use and put away.  Before I had to lay the pasta to dry on the counter, which in my kitchen is limited.  Now it hangs nicely on the rack, leaving room to prepare the rest of the meal as the pasta drys"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Knife Expert Approved; Multi-Functional and Durable,"I am a stage performer as well as a chef.  I specialize in contortion and throwing knives (often with my feet).  I use the Wusthof so much in the kitchen, that I thought I would incorporate it into my act.  I throw the knives at flying fruit and vegis and perform flips with knives between my toes and fling them at my assistants. Throwing knives are usually smaller, perfectly balanced, and forged from one solid piece.  They require perfect tang as well and incredible strength.  Wusthof is the ONLY high-end kitchen knife that meets these requirements."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Essential kitchen tool -- easy to season -- will last forever,"Season your new cast iron with vegetable shortening and an inverted trip in the oven for 45 minutes, do that a few times and the cookware will begin to pick up a black finish. It will take a little time. Keep your cookware clean with hot water and a scrubbrush, NEVER soap. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,I hate it,The toaster is terrible. It does not brown the toast evenly. I got this applicance as a christmas present last year and in that time I have not found a good setting for the toast. It's always either too light or too dark. The oven is almost as useless as the toaster. It's only large enough to fit about two slices of bread
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Super Bakewear!,"I've made cornbread in it & my only ""suggestion"" is to be careful your food just doesn't slip right out of the pan after taking it out of the oven! Although flexible, the batter was nicely contained on it's way into the oven...I didn't need to put a cookie sheet under it for support. I think I'll buy some additional bakeware like this in the future"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great value!!!,"This is a great knife for the occasional to the serious cooks. I bought this knife as my everyday knife to give my henkels a bit of a rest. The Knife is very well balance and very sharp making your work in the kitchen easy and enjoyable!! Just be careful, as the knife will put some occasional cooks out the rhythm as the action is a lot quicker than the tradional french knife due to the almost flat/straight cutting blade and great balance. I don't think i will ever go back and use my tradional French knife again"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,5.0,This is not your Mother's Dustbuster!,"I've been a Black and Decker girl for decades, but was really disappointed with the short run time and durability of the last one that I bought.  As a ""chick who likes power tools"" and understands how much better my 18 volt tools are than my old 9.6 volt ones were, I was intrigued when I saw that Shark had come out with an EIGHTEEN VOLT version of the hand vac.  "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,What a workhorse--I love it!!,"This mixer is such a workhorse; it is always up for any amount of mixing you want to do.  I have a black one that came with accessories--dough hooks, whisk, and drink mixer rod.  What impressed me the most, along with the normal mixing and whisking, is when I used the dough hooks to mix a LARGE amount of ground beef mixture that I was preparing to make a couple of meat loaves and meatballs with.  It tackled it with ease."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Great, except for the annoying rivets; 4-1/2 Stars","Just got this pot to replace my Farberware one. So far, it's almost perfect. The handles are low enough on the pot to give good balance while carrying it when full. I love the glass lid, which allows me to see inside without lifting it. It seems to fit snugly enough and the top handle doesn't get too hot.  I've just filled it half-way with water, and am waiting for it to boil. It's been 20min, and I have steam/large water droplets on the inside of the lid, but it's not quite a roiling boil (watched pot and all).The rim is curved outward (rolled), to allow for easy pouring--no drips down the side. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Revere Whistling Tea Kettle,"I ordered this kettle because I destroyed my former kettle when I forgot that the water was boiling and left it on the stove until its bottom melted.  With the whistling kettle, I can't forget when it's boiling.  It's also very sentimental because I bought the same Revere kettle for my mother when I was a teenager, and I'm now 71. "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Kitchenaid tools rock in my kitchen!,"For a number of years I had always purchased the cheap kitchen tools, accessories from the local dept. stores.  It's true that you get what you pay for.  When I received this set (I purchased the one in blue) I was very pleased with the overall quality of each individual item.  I would recommend this for anyone that has ever bought those cheap plastic spatulas, the cheap metal cheese graters that are difficult to clean and always end up rusting and those cheap wire whisks that end up rusting also.  You will get more than your monies worth out of this set. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,Don't waste your money!,"I had a batch of salsa to make at the last minute and thought this might be handy to buy and do the chopping for me. But after assembling it and re-reading the directions 50 times, it became clear that it didn't work.  Not only did I waste an hour trying to get the darn thing to work, I ended up having to do all the chopping myself.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Pretty Cool Idea,"So I got this can opener as gift, I was very excited after seeing it on TV!  I like the Gizmo because it was so small and wouldn't be a problem storing it, or having it sitting around on the counter.  However getting to open a can is another story!  I have expierence many ocassion where I cannot get it grip onto the can, after several tries it finally does!  Also the battery life of the gizmo seems very short - even after the first charge! So there are a few things that make this great:"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Digital Timer/Clock,"As a timer it is just what I was looking for. I can enter minutes and seconds without having to count up, it has a very good alarm, loud enough and long enough, and I can use it as a clock as well"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Knives the way they should be made.,"These knives are made the way I wish all of my knives had always been made.  They require the use of steel and occassional sharpening and oiling.  Relatively speaking, they're high maintenance knives ... yet I have tried many knives that are far more expensive and haven't found one that matches the cutting ease nor good balance.  The maintenance is the price you pay to have knives that are of such high quality, and I wouldn't take them any other way.  While the blade will not hold an edge as long as some others, when well taken care of it will outlast the others and the edge will be sharper than all others out there, a result of their using high carbon non-stainless steel, a metal not used in virtually any other knives, and certainly none of this quality"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Good value for the price.,"The glasses are a nice quality, in a good size.  My shaker was initially difficult to separate, but running the lid under hot water loosened it without any problem. We are enjoying experimenting with many different recipes"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,better then All clad,"This is a great must have pan for making gravies and sauces. A comparable saucier costs over 150.00 save yourself some money and get this. If you are into cooking you would know the differnce between the Tri-Ply and Simply stainless, the guy down below does not. The Tri-Ply line is the best value for the money period. I don't like glass lids, but these are ok. The fit and finish are very good. There are no hot spots and this pan is GREAT for rissotos and anything that needs to be stired constantly as the sloped sides let you use a whisk to get everything. I use this pan the most out of 10 pieces of tri-ply cookware I own"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Misleading actual price but good product,The comforter set is of a very good quality but the actual price on amazon website is misleading. The comfortor set arrived with a sticker that said the total price to be $99.99 and not $500 as quoted above. But productwise its a very good product. Highly recommende
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Form and Function,WMF products have a great aesthetic and I have found that all of their products I own functions as well as they look. This ice cream scoop works incredibly well. I like ice cream frozen hard and despite the fragile appearance of this item it holds up to all tasks I've abused it with
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Happy with my KitchenAid  Mixer,"Very satisfied with the cost, quality and overall process in purchasing my kitchenaid.  A good overall value would recommend to any interested. Enjo"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,2.0,Too tight,I find that this cover is too tight and pulls the lid off the mason jar after I use the vacuum sealer and breaks the seal. The large version works much better
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,$15 for this pan? Anytime.,"Well, maybe I wouldn't pay $15 anytime someone offered me a pan, but the $15 I paid for this pan was more than worth it. The pan is excellent for stir-frying, as well as many other things - I've used it to boil water, melt chocolate, make pancakes (one at a time though), etc..."
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,not comfortable,"I have purchased this set based on the other reviews but i didnt like the product since it was not comfortable,very heavy too"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Perfect Mellon Baller! Wonderful for fruit salad!,"Yet another perfect gadget from KitchenAid!  You can make perfect fruit salad with this tool.  It is very sturdy and has a large handle.  It works great on watermelon, honeydew, or your favorite melon.  You can easily make melon balls in minutes and you don't have to worry about cutting your self.  I haven't tried it yet but I bet it will also work great with ice cream.  Definitely a must have gadget for summer!  Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 10,5.0,Excellent small coffee maker!,"This is a great little coffee maker, and does a better job overall than my old 12 cup Braun coffee maker ever did. Makes good coffee, and the warming plate keeps it warm -- actually, hot! I had been looking around for a small coffee maker, and on a recent trip to Walmart, I saw this on the display shelf with the other coffee makers. It seemed to be a bit sturdier and better-quality than the competing Mr. Coffee 4-5 cup. Of course there seemed to be a zillion of those in stock, but I could not find a single one of the B&D SmartBrew on the shelf. I almost gave up, until I went 2 aisles over, and lo and behold, way up on the top shelf, there was ONE SmartBrew left! After looking around for half hour for a sales person to get it down off the shelf, I finally found someone. The best part is, it cost less than the Mr. Coffee. If you're looking for a small coffee maker, this is a great choice. And, no offense to Amazon, but I paid much less at Walmart. Let's just say it cost me slightly under $10.00 for mine! ;o"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Parents like it.,"My parents are having fun with this. They assure me it does the job. They have no cas, dogs, and minimal traffic. I think they proably enjoy watching the little fellow more than how well it works but my Mom insists it does clean well. Hope it lasts more than a few months"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,I WISH I HADN'T BOUGHT THESE SIGHT UNSEEN,"I usually love corellware so ordered these sight unseen.  The pattern is raised so when you scrape your fork across the plate, it's very annoying, like fingernails scratching a blackboard.  I don't like it and my husband doesn't like it.  They also aren't very shiny, kinda dull for brand new, although that's not enough to make me not like them but I really hate the scratching.  As soon as I can afford it, I will get rid of these and find something else but won't buy on line"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 17,1.0,Junk.,The unit broke the 3rd time I used it. The 3 times it did work it just was not power full or easy to use. The button is hard to push and the cord is to short... You can do much better then this thing
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Love it!,"I received this item last week when my husband saw me struggling with our old stand mixer.  This has so much versatility and the speed is great!  I have been using it each night to bake Christmas cookies and so far the speeds have done exactly what I needed them to, and it wonderfully easy to clean.  It's also very light so your arm doesn't get tired holding it! I would recommend this to anyone"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Well Designed & Durable,This was a gift for a daughter with large family of her own. She uses it often & really likes it
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Great slicer while it lasts,This is an excellent slicer.  I've used everything in it from carrots (when making my carrot version of thai papaya salad) julienned into matchstick thickness to wide thin slices of Korean radish.  Never failed me.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,2.0,mousepad as potholder,"I ordered a pair of these recently, because I liked their unique style.  But they get dirty quickly, and are hard to clean.  They work about as well as you would expect a couple of mousepads to work as potholders. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Less than satisfied,"Although this product is relatively lightweight, it is too short and therefore too steep for use out the back end of a minivan.  My dog won't walk up or down it.  It would have been nice if it was longer and folded up or expanded"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,I love sleepy time!,"Since I've bought these sheets, I just love sleeping. Besides the fact the thread count is so high, it wrinkles easily, you have to iron them after every wash. Great Buy"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Product,"I love this one very much. It is light and not very small. At the price of $15, I am very happy with it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Great piece, but don't expect it to arrive quickly","I have the tangerine one and I love it --  it's great for using in the microwave to make Rice a Roni and stuff like that.  However, my father ordered the Periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered --  for months.  We finally cancelled the order and I got something else from my wish list"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,An Excellent Blender,"Overall this is an excellent blender. It's well crafted and sturdy, made of metal and glass. I had a cheap Hamilton Beach in college and it just didn't cut it. I had leakage all the time with the HB blender and the 9 million speeds it had were worthless. As other reviewers here have said you only really need the Waring's low and high speeds. That's it. Seriously."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Attractive, roomy caddy","I have 2 of these for different flatware sets and they are great for sets that aren't being stored in a drawer (extra sets, etc). This caddy is very roomy and easily holds flatware with bulky handles (which is why I got them), but doesn't take up much space. It's very sturdy. I've had mine for a couple of years and they look just like new. There's plenty of room for a 5 piece service for 10 or 12. It has a nice, un-obtrusive, contemporary design. I'm very pleased with mine, couldn't be happier! "
kitchen & housewares,15 of 29,5.0,Great machine.,I bought this two weeks ago and returned last week for replacement. So why I am still giving it a 5? Well I used for four times and it work great. Much better then my Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 plus on Pasta Dough making. Because the Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 plus dough blade will lift up and it will not hold in place. Which give me so much headache I got to stop many time to push it down. The KitchenAid never have such problem. Beside it is much more powerful. So why am I return it for replacement and not for return? Because last Sunday when I use it the dough blade got stuck. I can't remove it from the base. So I return it for replacement but I really love this machine and even the blade for some reason can't be remove I still want to give it a second try. I hope it is because I was unlucky and got the only bad one. Since I also didn't see any other people complain about the blade stuck problem. And I do see other complained the Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 plus dough blade life up problem.

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Give up store-bought pasta (almost),"I also have the pasta roller plates.  I only use store-bought pasta for shapes that aren't covered between the attachments.  This is very easy to use and easy to clean.  Making the pasta goes pretty fast too.  It takes a little practice to get the length perfect, but that's part of the fun.  The bowl clips that come in the set are an added bonus because they are extremely helpful when kneading stiff bread and cookie doughs."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,BonJour Cookie Factory,"This product is the biggest disappointment. The first one we had to return to the mfg. because the motor did not work, at our own expense.  Then the large barrel would not press out the cookie dough and the small barrel was slightly better.  Save your money and make cookies the old way"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 20,1.0,Not worth it!,"I'm a big KitchenAid fan, but this attachment is very poorly designed. You have to be able to roll out the dough to the exact width of the ravioli maker for this to work at all. Then the amount of filling you put in needs to be precise. I'd rather make my ravioli by hand. I would get it done ten times quicker and wouldn't have to throw away batches of ravioli that are bursting or not sealing at all. A very frustrating product"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Best baking sheet ever,"We bought the first All Clad cookie sheet about 2 years ago and a second one last summer.  It's been fantastic.  It does bake faster and so we had to reduce the baking time but it cooks more evenly than anything we had in the past (air core and thin stainless, and teflon).  "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,WOW!!!,"I've wanted one for a long time, but, like others hesitated at the $80 pricetag.  I was so excited to find this for half price and it was worth the wait.  The box, interior packaging, literature and unit were in brand new condition...in fact I had to look through the paperwork to find any indication of the unit being remanufactured.  Solid construction and smooth movement and more importantly DELICIOUS WAFFLES.  The very first one (which I made as soon as I got it out of the box) came out perfect on the #4 setting; so did the last one.  Perfectly golden brown, perfectly consistent, flawless non-stick.  Timer indicator worked just fine. It beeps when it is ready for the first waffle and it beeps when the cylce is complete.    "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Good but not Great,"I like this item.  I am on the road all week and to save money it works well to heat things up rather than buying on the road.  I've cooked everything from hotdogs and hamburgers to grilled cheese and soup.  The one major thing it's missing is a temp regulator or thermostat.  It gets too hot at times, in fact hot enough to boil liquids and burn bread"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,freakin' awesome!,"i make several pizzas a week for my wife and i, and i've used a lot of crappy pizza cutters.  this kitchenaid cutter is actually better than the one i used while working at a pizza shop."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,everyone's favorite mug,"Combined with steaming, milky coffee, these cheery, red mugs add so  much pleasure to my day.  The red is vibrant set against the white interior and the glaze on the outside has a slightly mottled effect that adds richness.  The mug is nicely weighted and large enough to hold a very satisfying amount of beverage.  It feels good in my hands"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,THE best muffin tin!,I love this muffin tin!  I bought it 2 years ago on Amazon and came back to see if they were still available.  I'm planning to buy another.  Muffins really do cook faster in this tin.  The cups are bigger than the cheap aluminum muffin tins.  It's a great addition to your bakeware
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,The Best Wine Glass,"This wine glass is great for several reasons.  First of all, it is very light.  Second, you know how much wine to pour (pour to the widest point in the bowl and that is a ""glass"" of wine). The balance of the glass is good.  We also have the burgundy wine glass; however my wife prefers her red wine in the chardonnay glass because she doesn't like to hold the big burgundy glass. If you are only going to purchase one type of wine glass, I would recommend this one"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great everyday pot,"I have had this pot for about a year now.  I use it mainly for chuck or sirloin tip roasts.  I can easily throw in the chuck roast (6-7 pounds) at 400  degrees (water added) and end up with a mouth-watering, tender roast in under 2 hours.  It retains the heat exceptionally well.  I also like the overall weight of this vessel--not too thin and definitely not heavy at all.  Great for everything where a pot of this size is needed--stovetop or oven.  I will be getting my sister one for the holidays"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Wow - this product is fantastic!,"I thought I'd give this a try for my yappy chihuahua mix.  I did not want to try a shock collar, but I was concerned that this collar would be too large for her (she's only 8 lbs).  Although it looks a little large, she doesn't appear uncomfortable at all.  And WOW did this work!  The spray stopped each barking episode on the first bark - immediately.  After the first 2-3 days,  she is barking less in general and doesn't have to wear the collar all that often.  It's been 5 days, and I don't think she will need to wear it forever.  This product has been a total lifesaver, and my dog is happy too. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,The best bakeware that you will find,"I received the Chicago Metallic Nonstick jellyroll pan for my birthday last year and I love it.  I use it mostly to bake sheet cakes and they always come out perfectly and clean-up is a breeze.  Even if you happen to put off washing it until the next morning the dried on food always washes right off with a little soap and water.  I would recommed these pans to anyone- if you are hesitant about buying them-give it a try, it will be worth it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,"Works great, but found it cheaper at Wal-Mart","Works nicely, but seemed a bit overrpiced especially when I found it for $5 cheaper at Wal-mart.  It looks very nice and I like that you can put the paper towel into the holder without unscrewing anything. And it works as promised - one hand tears"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love this skillet big time,Fantastic skillet...I just love to use it and believe me I am in the kitchen just looking for things to grill--it's that wonderful.  I love the way it grills and the size is great for a variety of foods.  I am so glad that I bought this skillet--it was a wise investment and well worth the money.  The additional handle makes it easy to handle and move about also.

kitchen & housewares,8 of 12,5.0,Great Product!!!!!,I received slow cooker for Christmas.  It cooks very quickly.  It blew my old crock pot away.  The food was done in half the time of the crock pot.  It's very attractive too.  I love it
kitchen & housewares,19 of 20,5.0,A Le Creuset junkie,"I cook exclusively with Le Creuset, and I love this skillet as I do all my other pieces.  They cook food beautifully and are easy to clean.  The only time I had something to really stick, I was able to get it out by putting a little detergent and water in the pan and heating it up a bit.  The stuck-on bits floated right up to the top"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Highest Quality Cookie Press,"When I was growing up, my mom and I made spritz cookies all the time.  Now that I live in my own apartment, I wanted to continue making them.  I bought a cheap, plastic $20 cookie shooter that had no motor power to drive the cookie batter out.  I was unable to make any cookies and consequently, wasted all the batter.  It was useless, and I had to throw it away.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great Bowl... as near perfect as one could hope for.,"OXO makes really nice equipment and I find myself wishing more of my kitchen of my gear was made by them.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Works great!!,"This is a very nice, well made and sturdy item.  Not too heavy in weight.

Great design!!  I love mine.  You'll love yours, too"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,"Neat, but lower your expectations","I purchased this because I wanted a bundt pan, but don't have the room for the space-consuming pans.  (All of my pans and oven-ware need to fit in the oven drawer).  It's great on that count because I can roll it up and squish it in, and it pops right back into perfect shape when it's needed.  I've only used it twice so far, in the year or so that I've had it.  The first time I used it I didn't really grease the pan as I should have because I thought it would pop out regardless.  Not true, and we ended up with a crumbly cake.  Also, there was a chemical smell (not on the food) but in the air while cooking.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Save your ten dollars for something better,"This was the worst rolling pin I have ever used. It broke within a year of making occasional homemade pizza crusts. Maybe I don't know my own strength but the handles started to crack and the plastic piece in the end would fall out. I kept pushing it back into place, but eventually the glue inside one of the handles gave way and it broke completely off. It would have been less frustrating and more time efficient to roll the dough by hand. Save your money and go see a movie or something"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,This product is amazing!!,"We are now on day 3 of using this box and the crystals.  I have 2 cats and one is diabetic so she uses the box a lot.  I was hesitant to order the box because of the cost of the replacement cartridges but it is worth the price.  We put the box in the kitchen (because that was the only place I could plug it in) and there is NO SMELL.  Really.  No dust, no tracking, no sifting the litter, no smell.  This product rocks!"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,2.0,"nice features, mediocre performance","Although this unit has more features for the money than most, it fails in it's basic duty of toasting the items placed in it.  I prefer darker toast (an even brown on both sides or one side for a bagel) and waiting for two complete cycles at the highest setting to even get close to the desired color, seems excessive. This puppy is going back to the pound"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,5.0,Wire Wisk Attachment,"The wire whisk is a perfect example of how kitchen aid should make all their attachments.  It is made of stainless steel and works perfectly for making the fluffiest meringue.  It does not have that nasty white paint coating like other attahments, therefore it does not chip off into your food.  This is a must have attachment to your kitchen aid"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Not for the lazy,"The only reason I deny this ultra-sexy machine a 5th star is that I realize it takes a touch of madness or obsession to really prefer the Europiccola to an easier-to-use semi-automatic machine. But if you're the type who enjoys getting caught up in the irrational rituals of coffee, the Pavoni might be for you. Capable of making to-die-for espresso and lattes, as long as you're willing to take the time and learn its quirks (not to mention the quirks of espresso itself)."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Microwave before bake, save a lot of time & energy","I'm able to microwave my cake (for 2-3 min, till it rise-up) before put it into the regular oven for 5-10 min. By doing this, it save me a lot of time & energy; now I am able to make the cake in 20min. This is great. But remember, you'll still need the non-stick cooking spray."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Quiet & Cool,"I was really suprised by the power of this fan. This is the first time I've purchased a fan that has a remote control and I thought it was rediculous to have a fan with a remote control, but I'm telling you it has been useful. I have the fan in my bedroom and during those hot nights, all I do is reach over to the remote to turn on the fan and Instant Comfort. It's also light and far from bulky"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Good quality, odd color, bad packaging for shipping","I liked the quality of the pasta set and the price was right. My main quibble was the color, which was a slightly peculiar shade of green. And, of course, the big factor was that part of the original shipment and the replacement arrived broken because of poor packaging for a breakable item--something I've had before as an Amazon customer. Luckily, there was one complete set between the two damaged shipments!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"Metal can bend, but the grips are nice, and they're WAY better than plastic","I'd give these little things an extra star if they were a bit thicker and more sturdy. As it is, they've survived through sink disposal trips, dishwashers, being dropped, bent, and otherwise abused. But the thing is, I don't think they SHOULD bend. I found a really nice, heavy set of metal measuring spoons at Sur La Table that I like a little bit better. Though those don't have the nice grips that these ones do. Just don't put too much pressure on them or drop them in the sink and turn the disposal on like I did, or you'll end up with the grips all slashed up. However, the nicks in the metal can be cleaned up pretty easily with a scouring pad"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 21,5.0,This is the best,"I was taught how to make them by hand by a woman from Honduras.  She is 32 years old and has been making them since she was five.  She is extremely good and also quick.  She taught me.  It takes a lot of time, patience and persistence.  There is no way this could ever be a bad product.  One very important thing to remember is that it also takes practice to learn how to make them.  You have to be consistent on how hard you press in order to make them all the same thickness.  Consistency of dough (keeps them from sticking) and a cut up ziploc plastic bag are the keys to good corn tortillas"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Very good,"I haven't used it many times, but so far I find it very good. I have had a Cuisinart food processor before and find this one a little easier to use. It is very sleek looking"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Rack is awkward...,"Though the rack is awkward in that the handles are rigid making it difficult to find space to store in my cupboard, the pan and rack cooked efficiently and evenly and cleaned up very easily.  I would recommend this product despite the size of the large handles on the rack"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Makes a GREAT Wok!!,"I bought this product after being very disatisfied with several types of woks.  I've had 3 types; electric, common non-stick type, and an iron one.  Even the iron one does not come close to how well this pan sears.  It is deep anough and you can make anything in it, from fried eggs... to stir-fry... to stew.  I highly recommend it.  "

Excellent for single servings of lasagne, manicotti, etc.  The sides only come up about an inch though, making a shepherd's pie or pot pie type dish a bit on the small side.  The cookware is oven safe, but not broiler safe, due to the silicone handles"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Calphalon Skillet Combo Pack,"We were interested in the 8-inch pan, but couldn't resist the bargain deal of two skillets for just a dollar more than the smaller one.  The 8-inch is MARVELOUS for fixing breakfast eggs -- stay in the middle of the pan and easy to flip over."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,My new favorite kitchen appliance!,"Thanksgiving Turkey... WOW.... my family was so impressed with the turkey we cooked in our new Ronco Showtime Rotisserie. I bought a 12 pound turkey and it fit perfectly onto this rotisserie. However, I personally would not go bigger on this. After washing the turkey, I dried it and rubbed it with salt/pepper/lawrys poultry seasoning before putting it into the Ronco. I let the turkey cook for 4 hours as stated in the guide. The results: the most amazing, tender, fall of the bone, delicious, crispy skin turkey my family and I have ever had. I will never go back to bags, roasting pans, and eating Thanksgiving out again. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Wine Lover,"Despite what others have said about this not &quot;feeling like a quality product&quot; or it &quot;takes a whole 20 minutes to chill a bottle of wine&quot;, this product is awesome!  You cannot chill a room temperature bottle of wine in the freezer for less than 30-40 minutes and in the refrigerator it can take over 3 hours.  If this chiller does take the entire 20 minutes to chill a bottle, it's well worth it because it's the perfect temperature.  The chiller works great for merlots or cabs too -- takes five minutes to chill it to the proper 57-58 degrees.  I would definitely recommend this product...you cannot go wrong!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,2.0,Disappointed Purchaser,"I will probable not  be keeping these knives.  They are large and heavy, not a tableware set at all.

kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Looks great but rusts fast!,"On the first day of use, we managed to get rust spots on a couple of the knives. ON THE FIRST DAY! It was a wedding present so I couldn't return it. It was a huge disappointment because they really did look nice in the box. "

The material is high quality simliar comforter at store cost a bit more and not as well crafted. I have used it for a month and it did lose some loft but as long as it is fluff occasionally it retains the loft. The only minus is UPS left it outside when it was raining and the box got soaking wet luckily the comforter only got wet at the edges. I just air dry overnight and it was fine. Also the Comforter indicated professional cleaning. I have not tried it and as long as you use a duvat this might not be a problem

Does a fine job on the typical kitchen fare.  I had no problem getting thin slices by following instructions.  No, it's not a forty horsepower motor, but it is more than adequate for home use.  The metal construction sure beats the last plastic toy I had.  I like it! "

I ordered a ""natural"" set (for a mix & match look) from a catalogue store and they were not any nicer, although they were considerably more expensive, so now I am ordering a ""natural"" set of these.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the antiquing is not as subtle as I would like but it's good enough for the price.  I love them! "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,1.0,Broken pieces,"This set arrived in broken pieces.  Although the pattern and overall look of these products were quite beautiful, it was obvious from the packaging, that pieces would always arrive scattered.

I would not purchase this product again"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Good value but noisy.,"This is a replacement for the unit I got from Sam's Club a year ago. I have been looking for a good air cleaner with permanent filter. The first one I got from Sam's uses electrostatic precipitation which is not very efficient. In addition, it generates a lot of ozone in the room by the UV germicidal lamp. Thank God that there was a recall on that unit and I got a full refund after 10 months of use. Then I found this unit that costs 1/3 less after a $50 rebate. This one uses a so-called permanent filter that can be cleaned by vacuum. I have been using it almost every night for 2 months. The filter still needs not to be cleaned yet (YMMV). It has 3 speed settings, but only the low one can be used at night due to the noise. The timer is easy to set, but it will be better if there is  backlight on the display when programming it. The rebate was received in 8 weeks as promised"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect!!!!,"These are the cutest salt & pepper shakers ever! I had read that they were way to small and required frequent refills. However, unless you prefer the taste of a salt lick to food or are serving dinner to entire hockey teams, you should be fine. They are actually a little on the large side for a dinner set. But at any rate you can't beat the great mushroom shape and wonderfull colors. A must have for anyone who loves Fiestaware!"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Keeping my fingers crossed.,"This is my 2nd Roto Fryer.  The first had the same problem as I read about in other reviews and which a friend also experienced with hers.  The rotating button seemed to lock in place, often in the middle of a frying session.  My warranty had expired, and I decided to get a new one, because when it is good, it is superb. I highly recommend the Roto Fryer, but keep your receipts in case it has a problem. (I also bought the extended warranty - this time I am prepared) My friend's fryer was still under warranty and the motor was replaced, which seems to have solved the problem.  "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,4.0,"Love it, but don't wash knives in dishwasher","I love everything about the Opus flatware except for the construction of the knives.  The handles are hollow, and I think are filled with a white, chalky substance that has begun to leak from the groove between the handle and the blade (where the two pieces attach).  I have stopped washing the knives in the dishwasher, and the problem has ceased.  I would prefer the knives to be constructed of one piece of metal, and not have hollow handles.  I still absolutely love the look and feel of the pattern, and plan to buy another set"

kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,1.0,"DISSATISFIED, AM RETURNING BOTH ITEMS PURCHASED!!!","This is my first purchase on Amazon and I am satisfied with the timely delivery of my purchased product. However, I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this product. First, the removable rear casing, which allows access to the filter, does not fit properly on both units I purchased. Once the rear casing is removed it takes some force to get it back into place. Secondly, Amazon promotes this product to operate with ""whisper-quiet operation"". This statement is a farce. This product produces much more noise than my upright rotary house fan, both in the turbo setting and the quiet setting. I have made the mistake of purchasing two (2) of these Honeywell Enviracare 60000 Tower Air Purifiers for my family. I will not make the mistake of keeping them and will be returning them very shortly. This product is best used as a stationary low speed fan. Please note, in both the turbo and quiet settings this item does not produce the ionization & filtration that you expect when comparing this item with other similar items retailing at the same MSRP listing. Third, this products filter is not sanitary. The filter is of a honeycomb designed column that when cleaning you merely tap out the debris, vacuum and replace for further use. The core of this filter is impossible to access for thorough cleaning. Again, I can't believe the fact that this product claims to operate under ""whisper-quiet operation"" and it is hard to believe that Honeywell and Amazon dare to promote this item as being able to retail for $179.00. I am not being paid to criticize this product and am an independent consumer who thinks people should know the facts of this product"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 14,5.0,It's a great product,"My wife always had used KitchenAids stand mixers, and she`s very happy with its durability but, this  Stand Mixer is more beautiful and silence than any others.

Don`t think more, if you need quality and beauty, this is the stand mixer"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 18,1.0,worthless junk,"First of all, this knife is underpowered. It bogs down easily and the blades feel reluctant to slice into anything. But there is also a fatal design flaw. The internal mechanism of this knife uses a stainless steel worm gear to drive a nylon circular gear which in turn drives the blades. The second time I used the knife (on Thanksgiving) the blades siezed up on a piece of turkey bone. The nylon gear ceased turning because of that but the worm gear continued to spin. I took it apart to see why the knife blades no longer moved even though the motor whirred away. Result? The nylon gear is stripped and the knife is irreparably dead. It isn't that hard to design a mechanism with a safety cutout to separate the gears if one stops rotating (or alternatively, to build both gears out of stainless steel) and given the fact that this is by far the most expensive electric knife there is, Cuisinart certainly should have been able to do so. A knife that disintegrates as soon as it hits something tough is worthless junk. This one cost me $25 per cut"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love this saucepan..,"  I had bought the 10 pc. set, and wanted the 3 qt.piece I really love it. Clean up is a breeze. I bought my mom the set for her birthday.."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Love it.,"I ordered one, tried it, and we liked it so much I ordered another for our RV.  It does say to have it ""professionally cleaned"" but NOT ""professionally DRY cleaned.""  I solved that problem by purchasing 2 inexpensive queen size sheets from Walmart and making a duvet cover by sewing three sides, leaving the bottom open and leaving an opening near the top on each side for adjusting the duvet inside the cover.  The sheets do not need to be cut, and by leaving a long bottom (open end) you can tuck it under the mattress.  We have never slept so comfortably, and have put away the electric blankets.  It's even easier now to make the bed"

kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,It's fabulous!,"I do a lot of baking during the holidays and I had just gotten fed up with my other mixer.  I researched and found this mixer, thinking the 7-speed would be just right, not too much power as the 9-speed might be, and not too little power as the 3- or 5-speed might be.  So, I bought it as my gift to myself.  I've used it a couple times so far this year and I love the low speed mix feature where it does not throw the dry ingredients out of the bowl when first mixing.  The beaters are delicate enough to handle a thin mix while the speeds give it enough power to handle the thicker mixes.  Besides, the thinner beaters leave more of the mix in the bowl and less on the beaters when I remove them...something my teenage son doesn't like (he gets to lick them).  And the digital display and controls are so easy to use.  I absolutely love this mixer and am thrilled with how it pulls the ingredients together for the doughs and frostings so quickly and easily.  I highly recommend this product"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,One of the best things in my kitchen!,"This is the first review I've written, but the one bad review is so absurd, I had to put in my 2 cents.  I was just here to order a couple more of these - again, for gifts - again.  I have two sizes of these myself, and everyone I have given them to thinks they're great too.  I used one to mix up powdered-sugar-and-milk icing, I hadn't made it for years and remembered having to stir and stir and stir to get smooth.  Just a few quick stirs with this whisk and it was done.  It is great and cleans up SO much easier than a regular whisk.  And about fitting in a drawer - look at the picture, how could it possibly be any harder to fit in a drawer than any other whisk"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Wow!,"I only wonder why I waited so long to get one of these pans.  It is very easy to use and I've been experimenting with recipes from the Aebleskiver and More cookbook, which I bought at the same time, as well as recipes from several on-line sources.  Great.  Easy.  Fun to do and they add a lot of eye appeal, as well as a delicious treat to the table.  I saw one of these pans almost 20 years ago in Solvang, CA, and didn't buy it because we were flying home and I didn't want to put it in my suitcase. Have been looking at them ever since and thinking one day I would get one.  Have recently retired, the time is now!  I just love it"

I had a Hoover previously, and it lasted 9 long years - I run the sweeper at least once a day in a busy household.  This machine is amazing - it is lightweight - easy to put together (within minutes)- picks up EVERYTHING & filters very, very well - it has fantastic suction - The cord is 20+ feet & the on-board tools are very handy and easy to use and put away.  I am so very glad I made the choice for this one!  Easy to find and clean filters & they are re-usable - no need to buy more at high prices - simply pop out clean & dry and pop back in... Super!

kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,Head wobbles on mixer,"I bought this KitchenAid to replace one that I had only had for about 5 years and it was my second one.  The first one I got was 27 years ago and it's still running great.  When I first got the 2nd one, I noticed that the main head of the machine wobbled back and forth everytime I used it.  I had my husband tighten it a few times, but that only helped for a short time.  When it finally quit working, he took it apart and the oil had leaked inside it and formed as a big mass of jel - thick coagulated oil & grease.  Anyway, the head on my new mixer wobbles just like on the other one and that worries me.  Will I have the same problem in another 4 or 5 years?  I know things don't last forever, but one reason I have loved KitchenAid is because I have known them to last a long, long time... certainly more than 5 years.  Do the heads wobble on ALL the new models?"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Spice rack is great!,"I had been looking for a spice rack for a long time, specifically one that I could put my own spice bottles on and not have to transfer everything to different containers. This one is decorative and functional! I actually hung it on my kitchen wall instead of inside the pantry because it looked so cool. Most of my spices fit on it; the only ones that don't are oversized. "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Terrible product,Doesn't get hot enough to do any real cooking. Each side only draws about 700 watts. Eggs stick to the griddle.

kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Anolon cookware set,Good purchase.  Excellent quality and construction.  The first thing I noticed was how thick the aluminum was.  Hard-anodized aluminum with very even heating.  Handles stay cool and so far durable non stick with no scratching.

However, the steel handels are terrible. It got hot after 5 mins cooking even the temperature is set very low. You can not hold it at all. From their discription, it should be phenolic. When I called Circulon's customer service, they said the steel handels are just like that: it will trnasfer heat. Then why it claimed to be phenolic? So the pan is useless at all, unless your hand/fingers are heat-resistant!!"

It takes a lot of fruit and veg to get a small amount of juice but it produces a pure pith free drink. It's also very very easy to clean.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great Product!,"I never thought there would be a time when such a simple looking item could be so priceless! It's the perfect answer to fresh bread and great looks on the counter. It surely is better than having those tons of plastic bags laying around, what a mess that can be! I found a trick that works great. I let the bread cool down just enough to where it's almost cold then in it goes to the bread keeper and viola, worked perfect and fresh bread - was better than I had expected it to be and what made it better was the no fuss no mess!! When the bread keeper is empty it's a snap to clean it out with warm soapy water and let it air dry on the dish rack. I kept the box to store the container in when it's not being used, it's small enough that I can put the item in my pantry and it doesn't take up any room. I'll surely be getting another one of these for a holiday gift (or two). This was surely a great investment and well worth the price!"

kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Great for dark bread,"I grew up eating solid bread. By that I don't mean something hard but a bread of some substance, as opposed to the flimsy bread you find at the store. As in if you hold the bread by the edges, the middle of it isn't going to droop down."
kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,5.0,At 2 Pounds This Works Great,"I was looking for a pounder to help flatten chicken breasts (the have a habit of being really thin in one place and really thick in another).  After a fruitless search in various cooking stores, I found this.  I chose this one over the plain pounder just in case I would want a tenderizer.  Boy am I glad I did."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Early Bird Got the worm,"I'm very satisfied with these, had them for almost 2 months and no problems. Glad I bought them early, because I only paid $134.99 (after a $22.00 discount) from Amazon, now they're charging $237 for them. They clean very easy, no scrub needed, even if you let the food sit in them overnight. No major scratches, if you take care of them they'll be fine. The covers are great, I like the glass, nice to see how the food is cooking without having to lift the lid. The cover handles are a lil awkward, not allowing you to stack the covers on top of each other. And if you don't hold the cover handles exactly on the plastic grips the medal part gets hot, but those are minor issues. Overall a very good product and so happy I was able to throw my el-cheapo pots away. Hope to have these for years to come"

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,A Kitchen Essential,"I purchased the 4-quart saute pan a few months ago, and I have used it at least 3 times a week since then.  I agree with the other reviewers that the taller sides are a big advantage over the 3-quart pan.  This allows you to toss your cooked pasta into the sauce, poach meats and do various other tasks without worrying about the liquid spilling over, which is what concerned me about the 3-quart pan.  I found that the 6-quart pan was far too large for my burners.  I have cooked pasta sauces, chicken breasts, chicken thighs, meatballs, poached chicken, you  name it, in this pan.  It is extremely versatile and worth the price and the amount of space it takes up in the cabinet.  If you have limited kitchen cabinet space, as I do, I think that this saute pan, a large non-stick skillet (All-Clad has a great one in its stainless collection), the 3- or 4-quart sauce pan and a large Le Creuset french oven is all you need for most stovetop cooking jobs"

One of the main reasons for the purchase is cheese. We eat a lot of cheese, but it doesn't seem to last very long in the fridge. Shortly after buying the Pro III, we had a bar-b-queue for about 40 people. My wife over bought the cheese for the event and I also over bought the cheese for the event! Needless to say, without the FoodSaver Pro III, we would have lost quite a few pounds of cheese. We finally used up all that cheese and thanks to the FoodSaver Pro III not an ounce was lost!"

One 750 ml bottle reaches about the widest portion of the decanter, so this decanter provides maximum aeration.  Finally, the price is great!  Can't find anything nearly as nice for even close to the price.  While this is not crystal -- and if you leave your wine or port in the decanter for very long, you should not use lead crystal, as the lead can leach into the wine -- it is still very nice to look at.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,A practical pan for everyday cooking!,"I bought this pan for the hope of having a great stainless steel pan for everyday cooking and I am glad I did. It is very practical to use for quick cooking, it distributes heat evenly and quickly yet the handle doesn't heat up and it's user friendly since it's not heavy. I love using it in searing meat and cook the sauce after searing the meat in the pan. It is a very good buy that's why I bought other sauce pans with the same tri-ply material by Calphalon.It's a kitchen basic if you love to cook"

The unique way that it mixes and its ease of use has made our recipes significantly better.  We actually find that we are cooking more often and trying new and different recipes.  There appears to be some concern about the 4.5 quart size versus the 5 quart.  We have not found a recipe yet that we could not make in the 4.5.  Bottom-line... Great product"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Don't  mess with a classic,"This design has been around since the 1930's and it's still a good one.  We have lots of Fiesta, old and new.  We use the Fiestaware every day, not the rare older pieces, but the new stuff.  This little sugar and creamer on the tray is great for afternoon informal tea (that's when the hostess doesn't wear gloves).  The capacity is rather small but just right for a small group.  Since we don't have many people who will come to tea (they either don't like tea or us) this is perfect.  Dishwasher and microwave safe, all the fiestaware is pretty durable.  The little tray can also be used for other things too, canapes, bon bons, or feed two cats sides by side.  Available in lots of colors, we have the salmon (that's really pink) set"

However, I would prefer a slightly bigger size decanter.  Once a 750 ML bottle of wine is poured into the decanter, the inital area of wine exposure to air is a bit smaller than the Riedel Duck decanter.  Otherwise, the set is perfect for a quiet dinner for two"

It could go in the dishwasher safely, looked beautiful, cooked like a dream and was a perfect price. Everything was wonderful, but all of a sudden the non-stick coating gave up sticking to the surface and came peeling off, as if the adhesive had given up.  It wasn't abused and I used the right utensils and never cooked with it on high heat.  Now I have to return it to the manufacturer and the pan has been discontinued. What a pain"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,I found heaven in bakeware,"I have been using my set of basic pyrex since I got married. It served fine for years, but now I understand what all the fuss is about. You hear people rave about using great bakeware, now I get it. My first pie (apple) came out fantastic! The crust was lighter and flakier than I have ever managed before. I thought I was a decent baker but now I see what is possible! The clean up was so wonderful. A little soaking and every last crumb came off no problem. I used to soak my glass pyrex overnight but no more! It holds heat well. Longer than I was used to and its a nice even warmth, not the blazing hot then suddenly cold I was used to with glass. It looks fantastic on the table too! I love it"

The steel has that heavy, good feel in the hand...  You wouldn't know from just looking at it, but the design is unlike any bottle opener I've ever seen.  When you press down on the opener, a clever mechanical action easily pops the cap off, whether it's a twist-off or pry-top, and usually leaves it hanging from a magnet on the side.  The crazy thing is how much fun it is to do!  I think it's partly because people are so surprised by it; and it's so easy, clever, and just different than anything they've seen.  It's a great gift.  I've already given away three"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Light weight and not especially powerful..,"but,for the price, it rated 4 stars for me. So far, no leaking issues and the brush bar does rotate, as long as the front piece that holds the sucked up dirty liquid is replaced properly. If it is not, it leaks like a sieve and there is next to no suction. Regarding the time it takes for the carpet to dry, it really is not bad, if you just move slowly and give the machine a chance to suck up the liquid. If you move fast, much is left behind and it takes extra long to dry. Expect dissapointment if you want to get your whole house done in a day. The brush head is small and the machine is not very powerful, so for the cleaning to be effective you will need to take your time and make sure you get everything up. This machine is best for those without big stain problems and is best suited for those that clean their carpets with some regularity. If your carpet is trashed and really dirty, you need something bigger and more powerful (or professionals)"

Later, when I read the negative reviews, I felt the deepest pangs of buyer's remorse, especially, since the prospect of high return shipping cost loomed large over my head. Now that I have received the towels, I am so happy I did not read the negative reviews. Not too long ago, I ordered towels (from another site) listed at $120 per set discounted to $60 (how lucky) and the only thing good about them, when I actually received them, was the motif embroidered on top. (Of course, I promptly returned them, eating the outrageous shipping cost.) These towels are very plain to look at (pretty colors though) but in terms of qualities that matter, thickness, abosorbency, size, these towels are far superior to the overpriced fancy looking stuff meant only to look pretty on a towel rack. Best value for money"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very useful.,"This is a review of the Large Cookie Scoop. Works great for perfectly proportioning cookie dough, as well as for evenly filling sectioned baking pans with other batter such as cupcakes and muffins. Much easier to use, with less mess to clean up than home improvised tools for the same jobs, such as a tablespoon or serving spoon. Continues to survive the sanitize cycle of the dishwasher just fine and comes out looking brand new each time."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,2.0,Run while you still can ,"Let me start with saying I LOVE KITCHENAID! However, they dropped the ball when trying to make a coffee maker. We are on our 4th attempt at getting one to actually work. There were various problems, but I will say that buying the $20 coffee maker from your local grocery store would work better than this coffee maker. Again my whole kitchen is mostly made up of Kitchenaid, but they need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to this product."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,No frills but does the job,"It's cheap, it's huge, and it counts down and up. This is exactly what I needed. I use it for music practice - it has a magnet on the back and sticks right to my music stand. Nice, big buttons so it's easy to pause or add time. Big display so it doesn't have to be right in front of you. And decently loud alarm so you can hear it when you're playing. I even dropped it onto a wood floor and, although I spent some time finding the scattered parts, it still works. 4 stars instead of 5 because it has NO OTHER FEATURES whatsoever - not even a normal clock - but definitely a good purchase"
kitchen & housewares,25 of 25,5.0,"If you buy only one pan, make it this one","Yeah, yeah, it's expensive. Sure, sure, you could get a whole set of substandard pans. But you can't 'go cheap' on a saute pan. If you do, you'll burn stuff, and generally be an unhappy cook, so that's why you need a nice heavy one. I've got loads of cookware, but this is the most used item in my kitchen. Along with a good chef's knife and one saucepan, and maybe one to boil pasta, you'd be set. All Clad is a superior cookware to other brands, and I've tried or tested all of them. It's got a lifetime guarantee, so if you space the cost of the pan over, say, 20 years, it's a great value. You'll go through six other cheap pans in the same time period. Spend the cash, go All Clad."

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Small is nice for rice and grains,"I agree with those reviewers who've said that this 2-quart oven is not something you'll be making stews or casseroles in.  It's too small for that.  It is, however, absolutely perfect for cooking grains, which is why it gets more daily use in my kitchen than my bigger french ovens do.  It's fabulous for rice, oatmeal, grits, you name it.  The fact it performs beautifully both on the stovetop and the oven makes it excellent for pilafs, since you can execute every aspect of pilaf production in the same pot.  This is a very worthwhile addition to anybody's kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,2.0,They should call this a sausage maker Pasta at your own risk,"We were so excited to get this machine only to find out that it is mainly made of acrylic easy to break plastic. When we tried to make fettuccini our first try it got so overloaded we thought it would explode, as the front plates began to crack. The parts clearly could not manage the pressure. We were able to make sausage without trouble but I got it for Pasta! I was unable to return this item (bought online) and am very disappointed. I wished I'd purchased a metal pasta maker. Pain to clean and easily broken - was not worth what it cost"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Lots of Research,"I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this set.  I went to the various stores, the online stores and [...].  Got a comparison of the different types of cookware available and the advantages and disadvantages of both.  In other purchases, I do the same type of thing, and have at times found that my research didn't yield the results that I wanted.  But thankfully that was not the case with these pans.  I really wanted the new hard anodized, but you can't put it in the dishwasher.  And I know that no matter how easy it is to wash, I'm a dishwasher type person.  And I knew that I would put it in the dishwasher whether it was recommended or not.  So this Anolon Titatium was the perfect choice.  But as a previous reviewer said, you can only get it online.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Lasted until it yellowed,"Glad to see they still make this clock.  Yea, the parts are simple but I love the way it looks on on my wall.  I even changed the dots when I moved.  It used to be on a white wall, now it looks even COOLER in my new place w/ my own white dots on a GLASS wall.  The one I had for 10+ years just died.  I'm ordering another one.  Hopefully, it'll last as long"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Buy this and you won't regret,"I bought this from amazon after my cheap Black & Decker FP1400 Quick N' Easy Plus Food Processor became unusable just after a year (shattered bowl and eventual motor failure).  I was a little hesitant to spend more than $100 for a FP, but I am happy I did.  My wife compliments me whenever she uses it.  It's very quiet, very well-built, and very powerful.  You can't go wrong with the 3 yr overall/10 yr motor warranty."

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect for Pasta,"I have to agree with most of the others - these bowls are great. I wish I had been lucky enough to find them for $4.99 like the one buyer, however, at $11.99, I'm still happy. The bowl arrived perfect. It has performed perfectly. The color is lovely. I have 9 different color variations going on in my cabinet, so, even if there was an inconsistency in color, it wouldn't matter. The stamp is clearly marked on bottom, but, that isn't why I buy Fiesta. I buy Fiesta because I know they will survive my 4 boys. I suspect that given the number of pieces they churn out each year, some markings will be more pronounced than others"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,A must-have for the latte-lover,"This may seem like a silly thing to want, but the Krups pitcher is just the right size and shape to make good frothed milk for lattes, cafe au lait or capucchino. The shape is just the right height to put the nozzle under the milk and get either steamed milk or frothed milk. It fits well under the steam outlet in my DeLonghi coffee machine or under the nozzle on the espresso maker. We clip the insta-read thermometer to the side to get the right temperature milk."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Second times a charm for my unit, now I'm happy!","I upgraded my 10 year old crockpot dinosaur to this latest and greatest programmable slow cooker and added it to my arsenal of kitchen gadgetry.  I bought the Rival 6 quart Oval Smart-Pot Slow Cooker after reviewing all it's competition.  I discovered my unit was malfunctioning and never achieving heat above the lowest setting.  It took me 3 roasts to find that costly error out.  I've learned my lesson in the event that I ever crock pot shop again, test it in a water heating test like mentioned in other reviews and online blogs!  So I returned the crock pot and got the exact same one and it works great.  I'm very happy with it, I did find that because it was a bigger crock pot, I needed to add water to the cooking pot when before I didn't, maybe the heat needed a conductor to even out through the meat?  Don't know, but after adding 1/2 water, that was the trick.  I have not experienced the lid jarring or spitting liquids like other user comments and reviews.  I'm thrilled with the performance of this crock pot, and I use it 2-3 times a week.  Also, I do like the controls, it comes in very handy when you know exactly when you're going to be arriving home...and then your plans change on a dime, don't worry, the crock pot remembered to turn itself on warm!  Oh, relief!  There are times though I wish the pre-set times were different on the low setting, instead of locking into 4-6 hours, maybe it would go 6-8, and the same for the  medium and high temperatures with longer time settings for shorter times instead.  Perhaps newer generations will have an override switch?  I suppose then you'd have people not like the crock pot because it had too many switches.  So, all in all, I do really like this crock pot, the options it does have outweigh the things I can think up that'd I'd change about it."

This slicer is a gem, and for the price, if you are looking for a tool like this, don't even hesitate as you will love it too!! "

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Pretty and Pretty useful,"I bought my first set of these as individual knives in a little shop in Salzburg a few years ago. I have wanted more ever since. The twingrip series is our favorite series of Henckels knives. This set is pretty, and they're always dirty, because we use at least one of them in preparing nearly every meal! I am ordering several sets -- for me and for gifts"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Tried 2 with no luck,"I had bad luck with this product.  I received one, used it once and something shorted out(heard a pop and then it stopped).  It was easily exchanged for another, which also did not work well.  It seemed that the pitcher did not fit well on the base, thus the black plastic around the spinning mechanism, was slowly grinding away.  I took it apart, put it back together slightly less tight, tried putting pressure on it while blending etc.  Nothing worked so I returned that one as well. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,EXCELLENT!!!,"I absolutley love this dinnerware set. I got this as a wedding gift and let me say I am glad I put it on my wedding registry. The plates look even better in person than online and goes great with my kitchen. The quality is superior and love the look. The bowls and plates are a perfect size. I love the cups because they are big, but not too big- ideal size for morning coffee or a cup of hot chocolate. I would highly recommend this dinnerware set to anyone. A++!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,on time and super protected from breakage,"I received a 16 inch square, 6 inch deep box of dishes in a 3 foot by 2 foot, 12 inch deep carton. The inside was filled with inflated plastic bags.  Needless to say, there was not a ""chip"" on any of the china pieces.  The Spode blue italian is a classic design that delighted my wife when she opened her gift."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Smaller than I thought; nicer than I expected,"I saw this as a Gold Box option, and became intrigued. I searched out the various Bodum sizes, styles, and chose on the Pavina, 9 oz. It's the perfect size for the hand to hold, and the cocktails (what I use it for) stays colder; no glass ""sweat.""  However, I guess I'm just used to Old Fashion cocktail glasses that hold more liquid.  The glass does NOT feel as delicate as other reviewers stated. Actually, the rim is thick, and at first it appeared to be plastic (for durability, I'm sure). It's a very unique looking glass, and I like it."

It's a deep green with shades of blue.  The color is so impressive that I had to order the entire set of Fiestaware after I saw how pretty it was"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Happy scale purchase,Considered the Futura but this scale has a smaller footprint and is easy to switch between grams and ounces/pounds with the button right on top.  Glass on top screws off for cleaning.  I like it and have had no problems in the 5 months owned it

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Best cleaner I've ever had...,"I have a two year old that loves throwing dinner, and a large dog that loves rolling in dirt. On top of that I have very light colored carpets. This machine was easy to put together out of the box, four screws and snap on two attachements. The first cleaning I had used to clean a carpet that had food stains crusted over, and colorful chalk embedded into the cartpet (gross!!, I know). Carpets look like they are brand new. The heater feature works great, and the fact that I can switch the cleaner to rinse mode to after cleaning means I don't have to walk around on soapy cleaner residue, I like that fact. It has multiple cleaning settings, but so far I've only used the high traffic and rinse settings. I've seen other reviews where people complain that the machine leaks. I have not had this problem. I suggest though, that after using to immediately dump out the water bucket, and leave the cleaner on a hard surface (linoleum, or tile, or garage) to dry. This is the second machine I've owned and by far the best, definitely a smart buy.."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great for anything that needs a quick chill!,"After using a pitcher full of ice water time and again to chill our wine quickly for parties or just a dinner at home - this was a wonderful discovery!  We have had it for about 2 years and it has worked flawlessly each time.  As stated in other reviews, it will chill a can of soda (with no fizz), a beer or an entire bottle of wine in no time.  It does tear up the labels pretty badly - so scrapbookers be warned.  However, if function and cool factor is what you're after, this is for you"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Lasts only two months on average,"I've gone through so many of these that I have lost count. For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Easy and Works,"For anyone who likes to use the slow cooker, but doesn't have time to stand around and watch it. This is the product for you!!!! It works great, has a roomy pot, and it's own digital timer and warmer. Once the set cook time is done- it keeps it warm for longer than I've ever stuck around to find out about (doesn't tend to burn foods either). Great product- highly recommend"

However, the color of the comforter is completely different with the color in the picture you see on the web. The feature color is coffee-ish, and the so-called gold trim color is actually soil like. Also, I ordered the King size, but the queue size was shipped. Returned the set. "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,good for price,I think these pans are very good for the offered price. Get a little sticky after regular use from below but inside perfectly non-stick
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Perfect everyday pan,"First, the induction complaint is ridiculous, like whining because your 110v AC appliance won't plug in to your 12v DC cigarette lighter.  All-Clad represents this limitation very clearly, I'm sure the reviewer (who did not read the labels) could quickly sell this pan for near retail because it is so well made that it will last a lifetine with proper care.  The nonstick finish is quite durable, the pan heats absolutely evenly, and the handle never gets hot.  The pan is well balanced and perfect for flipping omlettes or anything else.  The design conserves energy as it distributes heat so efficiently that you never need turn your heat setting past medium to achieve high heat - this does take some getting used to.  Very responsive pan and a pleasure to cook with,  superior fit and finish.  The 10&quot; size is perfect for a couple's everyday needs and for omlettes.  It is the pan we use the most in our kitchen and the last one I would surrender, but a larger family might consider the 12&quot; version.  Price is high, but its made to last a lifetime and performance is unmatched.  We got ours as a wedding gift and I'd recommend it as the perfect gift for a couple with a passion for cooking.  If you're going to buy one pan make it this one"

It does a nice job, so far, I have to say i am very pleased.  I think if you take care of it, by emptying out the water container and small amount of water left in the bottom of the machine between uses, as the instructions suggest, this little steamer should be fine for household use.  I like to freshen things up between dry cleanings and it really does the trick and saves lots of time"

I couldn't imagine trying to get two people on anything smaller. My only complaint is the pump.  We followed all of the instructions very closely, and allowed the pump to charge for the full 24 hours before use.  It ran out of juice very, very fast. It did recharge in the 12 hours (as it states), but quickly ran out again when we were testing it.  Bed deserves an A+, pump deserves a D"

It doesn't slip at all because of the colored edges that hold it in place.  Also easy to clean, just put it in the dishwasher or wash with soap and water.  I just got rid of a wooden board that I could not get the onion smell out of but no problem with that here.  Also, they have now decided to tape the labels on  so no problem with any glue"

I've only used one brush so far, but it is perfect for buttering the delicate dough when rising or a crust after it's baked.  They wash up nicely and come with a plastic cover to retain shape when storing. For someone that bakes occasionally, this set should last a long time if taken care of.  They are very well made and as expected, Amazon's price was unbeatable."

I cannot understand why Lodge uses such a crude finish for its cooking surfaces."

I found that across all the sensors (512 of them), the temperature difference was only 0.000476 degrees (F).  Amazing!  This week, I am fortunate enough to have the flu, so my head is getting very, very sweaty at night.  I will take another set of readings during this feverous state, and post my results in another review.  I think my Wamsutta is going to do a great job keeping my big sweaty fever head under control"

With its interchangeable plates, you can adjust the size of the pressed garlic - a great idea.  But this contraption is so big and cumbersome, it's a mess to use.  Not to mention the fact that it's just too easy to pinch your fingers between the handles as you press down - foolish design.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"No way to improve this pan, it is perfect","We purchased this pan as a gift for my mother-in-law. We have one too, but ours has a dark coating on the outside.  This one is so much better! It could not be easier to clean. It really only needs to be wiped out.  I am allergic to eggs.  I can brown cheese for an eggless omlet and the cooked stuff I would have to chip off another pan just slides right out. There is no need to add oil or butter for cooking unless you happen to want to fry or add flavor. In the event that grease or other food gets on the outside you can use more agressive cleaners there. It heats evenly and quickly and  holds bunches (and I have a family of six). It really shortens the cooking time for multiple servings. I just got a new set of pots and pans at Christmas, and I do like them, but I really wish I had a whole set of this. I find myself reaching for this pan first. My husband says we should just leave it out all the time! We are mindful of using non metal utensils when cooking in our nonstick wear. That is not a problem for us, they are easy to buy and use"
kitchen & housewares,35 of 36,5.0,Wide jar can handle anything!!,"I have had this blender for three years and absolutely love it.  It is especially useful for cold drinks since the stainless steel keeps everything even colder.  As I have said before, you just can't go wrong with a KitchenAid and their products are worth every penny.  With the jar being so wide and a full 40 ounces, stuck ice cubes are a thing of the past.  It can handle anything you can think of blending.  Smoothies are always a problem with other mixers since you need to use a lot of fruit.  This baby seems to say ""Let me at 'em"" and purees without hesitation.  I just love this mixer and I love KitchenAid products.  They are worth every penny you spend and won't disappoint"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,juicer is great,"The juicer is fast, easy to clean and works beautifully. I will enjoy it for years to come"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent product if you love to cook and/or bake,If you are a frequent baker or cook this is an excellent product to own.  I use this on my counter top for easy clean up.  
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Kitchen Set!,I loved the pyrex set. I had priced the pieces seperatly at the store and buying them online with the starter kit is much much cheaper. You don't think you would use the little 4 bowls but I do all the time! Worth the price if your looking to update your kitchen
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"""You paid HOW MUCH for a vacuum cleaner?!!""","Which is what everyone says when I tell them I have a Dyson.  The minute they use it though they never complain again about the price.  People are always amazed at how much it picks up.  The attachments are sometimes clunky to change out and use, but for standard everyday use, this vacuum is awesome.  I recently brought it to a house my friend moved into and between the Dyson and the Hoover steam cleaner (another great product) we got her carpets looking new again.  "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Simply the best!,"I wonder if the viewer who had the grater handle crack in the dishwasher didn't buy a cheap imitation grater.  There are many look-alikes that are not the Microplane brand, and I would trust nothing but Microplane.  I have washed mine in the dishwasher (although I prefer to quickly clean in the sink right after I use it before stuff gets dry and stuck) and I have never had any of my Microplanes break.  I own every type of Microplane and they are amazing.  Don't buy a discounted imitation product, when the Microplane will give you years of great use (thus saving you money in the end!"
kitchen & housewares,31 of 31,5.0,Manly Grill,"The 800RXL is a ""manly"" grill that will be enjoyed by all.  However, know that it is large in size and that that is both an advantage and a disadvantage. For a small person, man or woman it might be a handful to lift and store.  That being said, it is a wonderful kitchen appliance.  It both looks and works great.  The tiltable bottom plate is a very nice feature as is the adjustable top plates ability to lock at verious hights so as not to squash more delicate items.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Egg Cooker,I gave this cooker to my mom and she absolutely loves it.  Cooks eggs perfectly and she can see the water level. Her only complaint is the off buzzer is very jolting. Other than that it has been perfect. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very Sturdy,"I love this pot and use it all the time. I've used metal cooking utensils with it that didn't seem to harm the pot at all. I've also put it in the dishwasher innumerable times without it recieving any extra wear. It's cleans extremely easily. Nothing has ever gotten stuck on the surface; even things like burnt beans, soup, or potatos come right off without hard scrubbing. The lid handle definitely does get hot, but just using a pot holder or dish towel alleviates the ""problem."" A must-have if there will ever be any boiling in your dinners' futures"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Best for Cheesecake,"Kaiser LaForme Nonstick Springform pans are the best pans for making cheesecake. Since recipes vary, you may want to check the size you will need. The 9-inch springform pan would be used for a large cheesecake. I love mine for making New York-style cheesecake. The bottom of this pan can be used for a serving plate but be sure to use a plastic server or spatula. The heavy nonstick coating on this pan makes clean-up easy! Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Fantastic Measuring Bowls,"These bowls are great.  I make bread a lot and they really help with the prep.  My favorite bowl is the 2 cup one.  The two cup measure makes it easier, especially when a recipe calls for 4 cups of flour (measuring two 2-cup bowls is a lot better than measuring four 1-cup bowls)"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,5.0,Perfect fit for the task...,I purchased this for a small office refrigerator.  It is a perfect fit for the door and it is to fill and pour
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,very good, I like this stuff a lot. The colour is so elegant.  It was wonderful to receive it  even before dealine. It is nice....
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,The Look is close to handmade...quality item....,"I received these dishes for Christmas 2005, use them everyday and love them.  I have not had problems with chipping as another reviewer has.  They are pottery not corelle so they will chip if you're not careful, which is true of any pottery.  You cannot beat the price for the hand made look.  These dishes coordinate with all of my hand made pottery serving items that I have purchased from local artists. They have the same hand made glaze qualities of handmade pottery without the high cost.  For everyday dinnerware, this is a great set that can be added on to with Sango items or have some fun, go to some local craft shows and you'll surely find some serving and accent pieces that will look wonderful with them."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,What a lifesaver if you're canning!,"This is my first year canning, and because I'm a bit lazy I didn't want to have to peel anything, let alone strain it by hand to get all the seeds out.  I ordered this Villaware fruit and vegetable strainer to give me a hand with peaches and tomatoes.  The instruction booklet helped me put all the pieces together, although the clear plastic funnel that shoots the seeds and skins out after the juice and pulp are extracted and pushed through the strainer is hard to attach, and I'm afraid it's going to crack each time I put the machine together.  Cleaning the parts was not half as bad as I expected.  After all is said and done - this is definitely the way to go!!  This strainer gets the job done with minimal effort and is a real timesaver!!  I'd recommend it to anyone who's going to be canning lots of tomatoes or, if you're into the &quot;natural&quot; stuff, making your own baby food"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,10-ounce mug,We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years.  They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.  
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Works decent - good price,"I returned the Delonghi BG24 to buy this as they are almost identical but this one is a much better price.  As a matter of fact, they are so similar they are probably manufactured by the same company.  "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Fiestaware Fan!,"Last holiday season, I received this Fiestaware Scarlet dinnerware set as a gift. I absolutely love these dishes. They are strong, look wonderful, and put a smile on my face every time I open my cupboard at mealtime. Not one dish has chipped or cracked and the color is even and vibrant. I find the size of each item comfortable to use. The fact that they are dishwasher and microwave safe is just another wonderful bonus. Now I am looking forward to adding more pieces to my collection. Buy this set! The quality and price can't be beat!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,1.0,Not Impressed,After I used this thing I sent it back and got a refund minus the shipping. On its coarsest setting it was still way to fine a grind for a press coffee maker. The thing also has a tendency to gum up. I was not impressed
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,AMAZING!,"I couldn't believe it. It said the garlic would fall out peeled and the peels would stay inside...and it did! I put 2 relatively large cloves in the tube, rolled it a bit looked at it and it looked like a mess in there - I tipped it up and out dropped the two completely peeled cloves and the peel stayed inside! How about that! I love garlic, peeling a lot of garlic gets kind of sticky. This is going to be awesome. The silicone did not want to release all the peel when rinsed - so I used my spray head for a sec and they all came out. I'm so happy! Woo hoo!"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great Tool!,"This is the greatest.  I've only used it once so far, but it worked fantastic.  I like that you can insert it into the meat and close the oven and see what the temperature inside of the meat is without opening the oven.  Cool product!  It's a great timer besides the thermometer"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great Flatware!,"I recieved this set as a wedding gift 3 years ago and we love it so much we want another set! It is very sturdy as well, my husband's #1 criteria is if you can scoop ice cream with the spoon and it won't bend the spoon and this meets that criteria for sure"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 16,5.0,Could be a great deal . . . or not,"WARNING: This item is shipped via fed ex in the manufacturer's box with the name and a drawing of the waffle maker.  If this is a Christmas present, try to be home to intercept it."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Ridiculously strong adhesive!,"I read the other reviews & thought how hard could it be to remove the labels from a cutting board. Well, they were correct. I used Goo Gone, Soft Scrub & home remedies & still had to use my thumb nail & lots of ""elbow grease"" to get it off - at least I think it's off"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Calphalon Nonstick 11 inch Square Griddle,Not as heavy as I anticipated it would be but it heats up quickly and has even heat distribution.  I only use it for
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Egg McMuffins at home,"My son and daughter are HUGE fans of the Egg McMuffin and wanted to make them at home . So when we found these great little items we ordered them, recieved them quickly and have used them frequently. They work as designed although we found that some eggs (maybe from a different farm?) stick just a bit. To solve this minor problem we just run a butter knife at a slight angle to free them. Again this happens rarely. Great product"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Sqaure Performer,"A very good baking pan, heavy enough to provide even heating and non stick performance.  I have always baked in them (I have two) but this Christmas I used one for caramels and one for fudge.  When the candy had cooled, I flipped the pans over, tapped the bottom and the whole block of candy, plopped right out.  When I am done cooking in them, I just throw the pans in the dishwasher and they are ready for the next task.  Great handles, make picking them up, while they're hot, a breeze"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,You need this!,"If you're like me, and need to use alot of measuring implements, then this is the one for you.  I cook alot and constantly needed to search for measuring cups, spoons, etc."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"heavy, but functional, but no flanges to cover entire griddle","As far as I know, (I have the 8"" and 12"" equivalents of this lid as well), the 12"" lid is the only one that has little flanges (?) that cover the spout portion of the corresponding skillet.  So less steam will escape.  This lid does not have those flanges, so steam will escape from the spouts.  Also, the resulting hole will let dust/flies in."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Does not work with Senseo Supreme,"Although Amazon has the ""Better Together"" pairing this water tank with the Senseo Supreme, it does not fit into this updated machine."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,2.0,Good well it worked,I purchased this thermoneter with the hope it would be a step-up from the basic model. The product never met that expectation. The &quot;professional&quot; did not read any faster and after a couple of months the display faded. I have tried serveral batteries without improvement. Stay away from this one
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,works well,"Handy item for grabbing that pinch of salt you always want while cooking.Haven't tried it for cheese.Fits well in hand, doesn't tip, well balanced"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent new peeler,"Like another reviewer, I bought this somewhat on a lark, but we were granted an abundance of tomatoes and super-ripe peaches this summer and I was curious.  The serrated blade really makes all the difference!  Now that apples are in season here in Massachusetts, it's doing a great job on them, too - defintely better than my traditional paring knife (and I'm pretty good with the knife, but this takes off noticeably less fruit along with the peel.)  "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Great time saver!,"I too have had one of these for years, and can't do without it.  It saves about 20 minutes for every apple pie I make.  Just rinse the apple and load with the core lined up with the mechanism.  The suction cup really sticks the mechanism to the counter top, and the mechanism does its job with just a few spins of the crank.  There is very little wasted apple when this thing is done peeling/coring/slicing.  It leaves just a bit of skin at the very top and bottom of the apple, but I don't mind cutting that bit off the spiral and munching it (the apple comes out in one big spiral, like a slinky.) Cleanup is very easy too.  Rarely, it needs a little hand-holding to start peeling a really huge apple, but then finishes just fine.  The nieces and nephew all fight to use it.  Now I'm buying one for sis (their mom.)  Worth every penny"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,GOOD POT AT A GOOD PRICE,I ALWAYS LIKE A PERK CUP OF COFFEE.FOUND THIS ONE TO BE JUST RIGHT.  IT CAN MAKE JUST 3 TO 4 CUPS OF COFFEE OR 8 CUPS OF COFFEE. ALWAYS RELIED ON FARBERWARE IN THE PAST AND IT STILL HAS A GOOD REPUTATION.  CLEANS WELL AND SHINES ON TOP OF MY STOVE.  EXCELLENT POT FOR AN EXCELLENT PRIC
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Beautiful,"These are very lovely. The color is deep and captivating, and the size is just right for individual servings. Haven't baked with them yet- but so far so good ="
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Simply Outstanding,"I could not be more pleased with this product. I have owned numerous George Foreman grills, and I use mine every single day. Finally to have one that has removalble grill plates that are dishwater safe, is just phenomenal. The only thing that ever irritated me about the grill was how difficult it was to clean. But now with the removable grill plates, this has been resolved. And to make them dishwasher safe, ...YES!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Its the best way to carry around all of your supplies,"I am sure many of you are like me.  You love to decorate, but gosh, where do you put all of the stuff?  I have no idea.  This caddy is perfect for putting all of your tips in, it also holds your colors, and much much more.  There is enough room for several bags, I also keep additional colors, paint brushes, and a couple of cookie cutters in here.   This is a roomy box that has been designed for keeping your cake decorating supplies in.  This is a definate must for those of us to love to bake"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,Accurate weighing with ease.,"I chose this Salter scale because the smooth surface allows for more room to weigh food.  Also, there are no edges to impede the use of a bowl.  I haven't been disappointed!!  It is superslim, lightweight, and easy to clean.  You can choose between grams and ounces, zero out when you are using a container, and it turns off automatically.  My favorite feature is the ability to add or subtract food while weighing - perfect for ensuring that my portions are the right size"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,I don't iron my sheets!!!! ,These sheets looked nice when I first got them but after washing them they are the most wrinkled sheets I've ever seen!!! They looked awful out of the dryer. It says you can iron them but I've never had to iron my sheets and won't start now!!
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Pretty Neat,"This little press sells at Williams-Sonoma for $20 plus a ton of shipping charges.  I have to say, it is one of the neatest and most used presses I've ever owned.  This SIMPLE press is a lot better than other ""fancier"" presses.  Use wax paper or parchment to remove your tortilla without a hitch (like other reviews mentioned).  It so worth it!  I love the press and I love Amazon for always finding exact items without the pumped up prices. "
kitchen & housewares,22 of 26,5.0,Great fun Grilling !,"I have never had a grill like this. I am a single person and really am using this ""indoor Grill"" outdoors on my kitchen patio. On high it doesn't burn up the burgers yet cooks at a nice steady heat and leaves those wonderful grill marks."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,One of the best ones I have found,"I really like my pan.  Many of the less expensive ones, rust, and mar up when you cut on it with a knife.  In fact, the pan touts itself as being cut proof. I also like that my pan seems to hold a very tight seal, that is wonderful when making a cheesecake that requires a waterbath.  All in all this pan is well constructed, and will give you many years of service"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Death by Ice Cream!,"We made our first batch of ice cream. Fabulous. The directions are simple to follow. The attachment are easy on and off. The recipe we made was the French Vanilla.  I cooked the base the night before and refrigerated it.  Our granddaughter watched with fascination as the ice cream ""grew"" in the maker.  Tonight it is root beer float night! We have no complaints. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,1.0,Not quite as described,"Thia little oven -- and I mean ""little"" -- takes up a lot of counter space, but provides very little usable interior space. I'm looking for a replacement for my ancient Farberware that would hold THREE 9 x 13 pans or a whole chicken. The inside of this oven is SMALL, SQUARE, and usable only with the included small square pan that is too small to hold the juices from a small roast chicken. If all you do is re-heat 12inch pizza, well, then, it's probably a good buy for the price. BY THE WAY, READ THE RETURNS POLICY CAREFULLY -- THERE'S A RE-STOCKING FEE even if the product description is misleading"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Birthday Gift Solved,"I was looking over the Internet to help my sister get the missing ladle that she and I were supposta give our mother for Mother's Day. Due to my error in the initial order, I ordered 1 ladle and 1 ladle showed up."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,"Bought it, tried it, returned it","One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Utterly Perfect,"As a longtime collector of Homer Laughlin's Fiesta, I can say this pitcher might be the apex of design. It is form AND function, beautiful and sturdy. The colors never fade, and  you never have to worry about a chip. The range of colors is outstanding. I have one of these in every color except black "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Stellar buy for the price and worth the wait,"After waiting the full time period of intergalactic back order, I finally got mine and am pleasantly surprised. Recommended to me by the owner of a coffee shop, this produces surprisingly well done espressos and cappacinos. Directions are a tad clumsy but followable, aided by an easy to operate machine. Clever features abound along with stylish looks. This unit works beter than much more expensive brands like Krups. Will it outperform some of the top end uber-expensive units? No. But then, I didn't pay $950 for it"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,Dangerously Sharp!,I tried a few knife sets before settling on this one.  I tried the Kitchenaid & Farberware sets and they cannot match the quality of these Cuisinarts.  They are so sharp that I had to change the way I prepared vegs - they are like razors! They are heavy and well balanced.  Did I mention sharp?  Be careful! 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,One side toaster,Like the other reviewers the toast always comes out darker on one side. I do really enjoy being able to make four pieces of toast with two different settings. This has not been a major issue but when you pay that much money for a toaster you'd think it would work more effeciently for your needs. I do really like all the different settings and there is plenty of room for your bagel even when not divided exactly in half which is usually my case. It's still not a bad toaster.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,I love calphalon ,"I have used Calphalon cookware for nearly 20 years.  I replaced my 1-quart with this new version because I scorched the old one.  The 1-quart is perfect for many cooking tasks.  It heats evenly and works best if you stay away from the ""high"" settings.  The lid and handle do not get hot.  Definitely an improvement.  "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,I love my Cuisinart.,"For such a small investment I find that the Cuisinart 5-7 cup food processor does a great job. I keep it on my counter as I use it so often. If you are looking for a quick, convenient way to chop, grind or grate whatever, I strongly recommend this product. I liked mine so much that my recent purchase was one for my son who also likes to cook."
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,4.0,"Good, but, not quite enough power","I bought this one last year.  I have given it to my sister and am now purchasing the 9 sp.  It was quiet and easy to operate, but when beating egg whites just not enough power.  I like the new beater style (thin wires), easy to clean. "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Worst can opener I've ever used!,"This is a very fiddly can opener.  I'm a techno-geek, and I couldn't figure out a way to reliably and easily lock it onto a can.  My wife and mother-in-law fared no better.  "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 15,5.0,A fine roasting pan.,"Roasting meats has until very recently been by-and-large out of my scope of regular cooking-- I tended towards sauces, soups, stir fries, and so on.  Largely stove-top work and if I were to prepare a piece of meat, it was generally in a skillet.  For whatever reason, this has been changing recently, and it occured to me that rather than fumbling about with Pyrex dishes as roasting pan substitutes, I needed a real roasting pan."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,Very inaccurate,"This is the worst oven thermometer I've ever used.  The clip is flimsy, so the thermometer falls off if you move the shelf, and the base is flimsy, so it's difficult to stand up. It is also wildly inaccurate.  Sometimes, it's off by as much as 75 - 100 degrees."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 14,4.0,Keeps grounds from coffee when paper filter collapses,"I had one of these once and don't know what I did with it.  I used it alone and didn't care for it.  It didn't filter as well as paper.  BUT...paper often collapses especially when the filters have been bent or mis-shapen and you aren't making a full pot of coffee.  Then the grounds get into your coffee.  YUK!  So I'm getting another to use with my paper filters because they collapse so often.  I put the paper inside  the basket filter.  That way my coffee is well filtered from grounds and anything else.  If your paper filters often collapse and you HATE grounds in your coffee, this is a must if you have a Mr. Coffee or comparable coffee maker"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 2,1.0,"POORLY pack , A big dissappointment after waiting 4 months!!!!!!!!!!","I received my Ariete  expresso maker damaged after waiting 4 months!!! The packing of this item is extremly bad!!! The Plastic holding tank was broken into pieces because of the poorly designed package.

Dont know if the product is good or not ,But beware of the service from AMAZON!!"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,good solution to warped and rusted cookie sheets,"I was tired of getting those discount cookie sheets that warp and rust under the curled edges.  For just a few bucks more, I love this sheet.  You don't have to worry about scraping the non-stick coating off - so clean up is easy.  Also, water does not get trapped anywhere on the flat pan, so no rust.  The edges are not smooth, but I don't think they are sharp enough to cut a finger.  This was one of my best kitchen purchases. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Worked for a whole 2 months,I bought this product based on the reviews here.  So now it's time for my own.  This canister only lasted 2 months before it developed a crack on the bottom and no longer works.  I don't see any warranty information here so I guess I'm out of luck.  Buyer beware.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,THE ESSENTIAL KITCHEN TOOL,"I hate to think of how many years I used cheap knives -- about a year ago I needed to replace some kitchen tools and this set is the HEART of my kitchen, WORTH EVERY PENNY! When I opened the box I was impressed at the weight and balance of the chef's knife. It's a work of art. I realized all at once that I'd never even HELD a real knife before. Saying that these tools are a pleasure to use is an understatement! There is a day and night difference between these knives and the cheap knives you've probably got in your knife drawer. Life is short. Use good tools. This is an excellent set at a great price! You will never regret having upgraded to these knives"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Simply the Best!,"This is truly the best all-around piece of cookware available anywhere.  It's low height, wide round shape, and heavy weight make it perfect for almost anything from stove-top cooking to long oven braises.  If I only had one pot in my kitchen... this would be it"
kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,2.0,Disappointed,"I slice many whole pieces of Italian meats - Salami, Mortadela, and  procuitto.  This slicer is a basic, economical home slicer and does not perform anywhere close to a deli slicer.  The unit itself it to  small to take a large product and the blade runs to slow for doing a good job on hard cheese. The engine actually starts to smoke on the tough jobs.  Additionally, it really can not achieve a super thin slice - it is just not that robust."
kitchen & housewares,30 of 30,2.0,In addition..,"I would like to mential, also, that without that terribly uncomfortable and useless slab of foam in the middle the ""gel"" material is very comfortable.  The problem with taking it out and using it is that they just don't put enough of it in.  They would need at least 2 x and maybe even 3 x as much of that material.  I had to fold it in half to double the thickness in order to be comfortable.  I must say that if this company took out that crappy foam insert and put more gel in this would be the most comfortable pillow I've ever had and would earn 5 stars.  I hope LCM home reads this cos I would definitely buy it"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 17,1.0,This product didn't live up to expectations,"I purchased this pad after reading a review here with the hope that this was the answer to my sleeping problems associated with premenopause. It didn't seem to keep me cooler when I got hot, and it didn't warm me when I was cold. I'm sending it back"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Makes a great pot of coffee!,"I agree with the previous owner: I don't know if the makers heeded similar complaints, but my urn works beatifully. It really is quite attractive, it has never leaked, and it brews up the 45 cups pretty quickly, all things considered. The red/green lights on the front make it VERY clear when the coffee is ready to be poured, and I get rave reviews from those who have tasted the coffee (and smelled it while it brewed!). Just remember to use coffee especially ground for percolators, as the other grinds tend to be too fine and will leak into the coffee!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Table Fan,The fan is quiet and ideal to circulate air in any small area.  It is perfect on the kitchen table or even a shelf area. It has two speeds located on the back dial of the unit. The cord is grounded for safety. It is UL coded and tested. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Save the Money,Bought three of the six packs of filters for less than JUST TWO cost in a brick and mortar store
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,4.0,Chinoise...not a china cap,"To those who are disappointed in this product...I believe you are looking for a ""china cap,"" also sold on Amazon. A china cap is more of a wire mesh item, made more specifically for straining very tiny particles like minced herbs or fat globules from a stock (it still may be helpful to use cheesecloth in both for more precision). Both types of strainers are great to have on hand, but a china cap is made to be more precise in it's straining quality. Just some advice, hope it helps"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Perfect for me!,"I think this product is perfect for what I needed it for. Just what the box said, it's for area rugs, or high travel spots. It got our carpet looking 100% better and dried VERY quickly with the overhead ceiling fan on. The direction do say that it will dry quicker with a fan."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Solid Hardwood makes this a good buy,"I have bought 2 of these bookcases.  They are very well made, set up in 2 minutes.  Forget the pressed wood bookcases -- I have.  They sag and fall apart.  Not these bookcases.  They are solid wood, the real thing, and best of all, there is no assembly required, just unfold where you want it, and start filling it up! Also, very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again.  Excellent buy for the price.  Not made in China, I think it is made in Vietnam"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,I am happy I bought this mitt.,"After reading the reviews on the regular size mitt, I ""save[d] it for later"" for about a year.  Thankfully, OXO came out with the petite version.  It is definitely stiffer than a cloth mitt just as the reviewers on the regular mitt wrote, but it's still an excellent mitt and I can carry a super hot fryer and have water splash on the mitt with no worries. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,5.0,Good little machine,"I used this grinder to make deer sausage.this was my first attempt to even grind my own meat or to make sausage.That little machine is easy to use no problem grinding the meat although it takes two people to make sausage.Link sausage that is with pig casings,using the saugage attachment.My daughter and i made 65 14""sausage links,and we hade fun doing it.that little machine is worth its money,and in my opinion not a bad price"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Nice toaster,"I purchased this toaster recently and I like it very much. It is attractive and because the slots for the bread are contained within the body of the toaster, the sides of the appliance stay relatively cool to the touch so you won't ever accidently melt the bread bag if you leave it beside the toaster (lol, I've done this and let me tell you it's very hard to clean melted plastic off of chrome!)Also arrived in record time."
kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,5.0,Misto your way to martini paradise!,"A dry martini is a thing of beauty to behold.  However, mixing a good one is no small feat.  This vermouth mister not only increases your odds of success, but also adds a jazzy flair to the preparation process.  I like to  lightly spritz my chilled glass before pouring in the ice-strained gin.  A  small but vocal contingent of fellow martiniacs prefers to float a vermouth  spritz on top of the gin after it's strained into the glass.  Either way,  garnish with a vermouth-marinated olive and remember that immortal line  from &quot;The Seven-Year Itch&quot;:  &quot;There's gin and vermouth.  That's a martini.&quot"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very nice towel,Love these towels. Lost all the fuzzies in the first wash. Excellent deal
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Sturdy!,"These cups are larger than they appear!  And very strong and sturdy - a thick ceramic.  I use them every day to microwave eggs, etc. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,2.0,pretty in the box,what a disappoinment!  the stainless steel dents & is impossible to keep clean.  the gasket on the lid is flimsy & bent up on the first use. the handle holds water between itself & the glass lid. and it doesn't work any better than any other slow-cooker.  at least the oval design is superior to round
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,great coffeemaker,"This is our third Capresso coffeemaker (in a good number of years).  In fact, our 2nd one was repaired by Capresso, and has been given to our daughter to enjoy.  Capresso makes great coffee, and obviously hot enough water.  I miss the removable tank in which to fill the water, however.   The stainless steel body is attractive, but I would have preferred our former color--white.  My kitchen doesn't have any stainless steel appliances.   Oh, well, my Capresso is my accent piece!   "
kitchen & housewares,52 of 53,5.0,Pet Stain and Odor Remover,"This Bissell formula is very good for all types of pet messes on carpeting. The cleaning power is good and the scent is pleasant.  Since I care for many foster dogs in my home, I buy a lot of this product"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Excellent value!!!,"I've wanted to get a good quality Chef's Knife for years -- but, my cooking skills don't warrant a $100.00 premium knife. Then I found the Calphalon knife -- and almost bought it. Happily, I found this 2-Knife set for roughly the same price as the Chef's Knife alone. I'm very pleased with them (...so far). I've been using them almost daily for a couple of months -- and they are holding their edge nicely. They are the perfect soulution for my needs -- quality German steel -- assembled in China (...thus the bargain price)"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,COFFEE GRINDER REVIEW,Works very well - but was a bit pricey.  Last BRAUN grinder I owned lasted 4 to 5 years with daily use before the plastic housing fell apart
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Great HOT wok - with terrific instructions,"I've done a fair amount of stirfry over the years, and for a long time had a professional level one similar to this Breville.  Once it died, I did not get another, and anytime I tried to do stirfry on the oven it was a disaster.  Even a new pretty powerful $800 gas oven did NOT get the on-the-stove pan hot enough.  I would end up 'stewing' the food, and it bore little resemblance to my stirfry's of the past."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,4.0,"Great vacuum, tiny battery","The other reviews pretty much sum it up, but I'll put my thoughts in too."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Nice Fry Kit,"We have used this item daily for a few months now.  We like it so much we bought two!  Perfect size for one to two people.  Its great for fries, perigees, or (a few) chicken wings.  Be sure to use the basket that comes with it for frying, because it splatters without it!  We even use the pot to boil noodles.  Great all around product!  This item can sometimes be difficult to find.    "
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,Perfect Size & Price,Didn't want a huge food processor at a huge price and this one is just right.  Love the accessories that are included.  Runs smoothly and quietly and is easy to use and clean.  
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good item!,"I like using this slotted spoon very much. Nice handle and works well. When you drop them they don't make a lot of noise because they are soft, silicon."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,The Best Knife I Own,"I bought a collection of Pro-S knives about a year ago and never thought this one would be the one I used the most. It is great for use as advertised - peeling, strawberries, etc. But what they don't tell you is how many other things it is useful; cutting chicken legs and thighs, cutting away the ribs from prime rib, and any task where you need to cut something you can't see. Mine dropped on the floor and the tip bent today - definately want to take care of this knife - and if it doesn't straighten out right I guarantee I'll be buying another one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great summer set,"The pitcher is large, the glasses are a great size and design, and the shot glasses are a nice touch. What a great way to make and serve margaritas"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Top Tongs,"These tongs (or some tongs much like them) are essential in the kitchen. Yeah, they're 16 inches, which means they are long, but if you have a stove of any size you'll use them daily. Some reviewer below said they were only for the bbq, but I use them at the stove without any ill effects (though they'd be great bbq tongs--I just don't want any damage to happen to them). They handle smoothly, have a light touch, and lock and unlock quickly and easily. I like these tongs so much, I get sad when I have to cook without them (at someone else's house, for example). Seriously. Get them"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,This is terrific!!!,"This kettle is terrific!!  Fast, hot and reliable - buy it!"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,I am an engineer and I am a very picky guy too but ...,"... the Capresso Ultima is just a wonderful espresso machine regardless of the price/performance ratio. It is very well engineered. You can tell the refinement of the design simply by looking at the layout of the compartments, the water tank with a clever fold-in handle that is very well balanced while you are adding water, the perfect tamping mechanism, the layout and feel of pressing the buttons and rotating the lever arm, and the matte surface finish. All accolades about this machine from previous reviewers are true so I won't be repeating them here. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very Impressed,"This does what it says.  It keeps my ice water cold (there is still ice in it over 12 hours later).  And as a bonus it makes me be better about drinking water throughout the day.  I also like the shape of it, which is sort of irrelevant, but every little bit helps"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,1.0,Not a good choice to cook rice,This rice cooker should be an embarassment to Zojirushi. Do not buy it.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Bought this stockpot with a lot of expectations. I used it for the first time to make soup, and there were scratches all over the bottom. I even used a wooden ladle instead of a metal utensil. I expect quality from Cuisinart cookware and also from quantanium non-stick coatings. I also expected it to be heavier"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love it!!!,"I bought this set a month ago from amazon.com and I've been using it everyday. I must stay it is the best cookware set I've ever owned. I really enjoy cooking with it, the clean up is VERY EASY, everything comes off right away, no scrubbing is needed! I wish I had bought 10 piece set... I highly recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Great quality stoneware,"I bought two of the dinnerware sets for my wife. We like them so much we ended up buying all the accessories (lasana dish, mixing bowls, onion bowls, ect.). "
kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,5.0,Outstanding,"It makes the best coffee I've ever had.  The carafe works perfectly and keeps the coffee hot, and at nearly peak flavor, for hours.  Those few reviewers who say that it doesn't keep the coffee hot simply have a carafe with a broken vaccuum seal."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,A bit of special care needed,"After reading the review I reconsidered but decided to give it a try but skipped the dishwasher.  Immediately after use I soak it in a container of hot soapy water and swish a bit, rinse, swish it through another round or two of soapy water just to be sure that there is nothing left and let it air dry.  I've found that this is pretty effective in getting it clean and its effectiveness in tenderizing is worth the extra effort"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,Good for storing,"It is nice 5 piece set, durable and handy..though I did not like the plastic covers"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,A Ferrari Toaster,We had this toaster for several months and to start with our overall rating: The best toaster we ever had!
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great pan!!,This pan is great for pancakes and eggs.  Haven't tried it for any thing else yet.  My father-in-law had the pan at his house and we just loved it. So I looked into buying one for us.  Department store price was up to $60 so I was quite delighted when I got it through Amazon for $20.  I'm considering buying other circulon pans
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,This product should be pulled from the market,"I got this coffee maker for christmas, and the first time I went to pour a cup of coffee the basket swung out dripping hot coffee and grounds all over. We should all get refunds and the product should be pulled from the market. It is a danger to all how have one"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Really Like It!,I really liked using the Villaware 10-square Ravioli maker. The first time my husband and I used it we had pefect ravioli. The cutting edges could be sharper but besides that it works great

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,The good and the bad,Good:
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Baking tyro,The silicone glove is much more easy to handle than a potholder and doesn't slip out of my fingers while I am holding a hot cookie sheet or muffin pan.  I wish somebody had come up with these years ago
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Classic - tasteful - retro,You don't have to be an avid FiestaWare collector to appreciate the timeless beauty of this piece.  The black pitcher goes with any decor or color combinations already owned.  The fact that it's a discontinued color makes it that much more in demand.  I love mine
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,"Very helpful, especially in a small kitchen!","I love my home very much, but it has a very small kitchen with little cabinet space available for my new Calphalon products.  My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and installed it that morning.  It is wonderful to have all my cookware right in arm's reach, yet out of the way.  Also, it makes our kitchen look wonderful.  What a great way to show off your Calphalon collection!  Useful and attractive, it's well worth buying"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Value!,"I have used KitchenAid products for many years but have never tried KitchedAid II. I am very pleased! The quality of this item is amazing, especially for the price"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Pretty little dishes!,"Not a necessary addition to the Nova Brown dishes, but very pretty and will have a number of uses.  The pottery and colors are beautiful and the price can't be beat"

kitchen & housewares,42 of 42,4.0,Perfect Slicer for Home Use - 5 Star Potential,"I used to work in a deli and have used my fair share of commercial slicers.  When I decided to buy one for home use, I knew that I didn't want one of the large, cumbersome slicers that I had used in the past, and that this would mean some tradeoffs in terms of power and quality.  After taking a long look around, I finally decided on the CC-630, and I'm glad I did.  I believe this unit offers an excellent compromise between commercial power and everyday practicality."

kitchen & housewares,25 of 26,5.0,There is NO OTHER if you like fondue,OK the price may give you anxiety attacks but for those chefs and Emerill wanna be's there is really no choice available for a fondue lover. 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best froth ever,"After spending time searching and searching for a froth maker, I decided to go with the Froth Au Lait, This was the best thing i could have ever bought. I have tried many of the steam frothers and they either had to many parts, or clogged up on you, not to mention the difficulty it was to run them, This appliance was has been so easy to use and clean that i would not recommend anything else. The froth itself is like nothing in the world and i have not seen any other appliance come close to comparasion."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 14,4.0,Classic Style,"Fiestaware is timeless. Classic shape, classic colors, great quality. The finish is lead-free. The looks are from a bygone era but hold a charm that makes the transition to current styles. Great gift... can always be used. The only drawback I would say is the colors. Sometimes it is difficult to match colors to other brands of dishes you may already have"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 10,4.0,"Pretty good,  but kind of small","This salad spinner is great for a very small head of lettuce, but cannot hold enough for me to buy a large one.  This is a problem for us because we eat a lot of lettuce and can't hold a lot for a later time if we want.  "
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,This product deserves no stars,This pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread.  For the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster I have ever owned.  It is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,Reviewers don't understand how to use this toaster,The reason for all the one-sided toasting that everyone is complaining about is because their toaster was set for bagels. The bagel setting intentionally toasts on one side only.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,A great bottle... with some minor annoyances,This is a great bottle.  
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Nice Pan,"Works well, and cleans up well.  I just spray it with oil before cooking, and the muffins come out easily.  After cooking, I may soak the pan in water overnight, put in the dishwasher, and they come out clean.  I want to buy another one or two of these, but they raised the price! "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 12,5.0,Excellent quality value.,"This is a sturdy, big, 4-inch pizza wheel, complete with thumb guard, which produces clean, straight-through cuts on the first run every single time. Its smooth-running, beveled wheel blade never seems to need sharpening and its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional lightweight cutters do, and rendering it perfect for pizzas, pie crusts, dough, etc."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great dishes,"These dishes were the perfect color for our new home, and that's probably my favorite thing about them.  They look so sharp on our table!  But of course, they are durable (my 6-yr-old and 8-yr-old haven't hurt them yet, and they load the dishwasher) like you would expect from Corelle.  I bought 12 place-settings so that I wouldn't always be washing dishes for our family of 6.  We love these dishes"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Emile Henry Couleurs Red Mugs,"These mugs are a beautiful rich red and are large enough to use as an everyday drinking glass. Usually mugs in sets are small and useless, but I have found these to be ideal for water, milk, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Cleaned what others missed!,"The 9400 ProHeat 2X managed to get out an oil stain that 2 other cleaners had left behind.  When the oil spilled out of the frig and managed to get into the living room from the kitchen, we were horrified.  Cleaned it up right up with the Bissell Little Green.  Cleaned it again later that year with a different shampooer.  You could still see the stain and it returned fully afterward each time.  This time - - - it is really gone, completely, and did not come back.  I have a dog, and a cat.  We used the pet odor cleaner and the odor is also gone from my home.  Hooray for this steam cleaner.  I highly recommend it.  The lightness and ease of use are excellent.  But the proof is in the carpet itself."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,George Foreman GR82B Rotisserie,This is an awesome rotisserie.  Very easy to use and clean.  My 14 yr. old daughter has mastered the art of rotisserie cooking with this machine.  Thanks George
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,This is a GREAT item!,I love this stockpot.  Now I can make a big batch of stew or soup without using two pots.  It cleans up very well and is easy to handle
kitchen & housewares,14 of 18,4.0,A nice cooler,"We like to entertain and to drink wine, and the one thing we were missing was a wine cooler. This is just the piece we needed. It is very simple, yet classy. A great way to add that special touch for a quite dinner for two or four. Handy enough to be used on a daily basis"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent product,I love the style (tower) as it takes up little space on my desk.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,very sturdy product - ready for action,"I am used to using the 4-sided open bottom graters found at the supermarket or the OXO grater with just two sides.  This is so much better.  It has a bottom so you can keep everything you grate inside and then dump it all in the bowl at once.  It is also very sturdy so you can lean over it to get leverage when grating big hunks of cheese.  So far, I have only used 3 out of the 6 sides"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Something Pretty To Display In Your Kitchen,"Although I have a full set (expensive) of stainless steel measuring cups from Williams-Sonoma, I bought this set because I can leave them sitting out in my kitchen for everyone to admire.  They (blue) match my decor and are lovely and feminine.  While I will continue to use my Williams-Sonoma cups, these will be more accessible when I need to measure something quickly.  Instead of going to the cooking/baking supply closet, I can just reach over and use them.  As her new series on The Food Network premiered today (Nigella Lawson's Feasts) her cookbooks and cooking line are going to become hot again.  This series, her first on this network, offers recipes from her book FEASTS.  This is an extremely nice price for such quality cookware.  I have a feeling I am going to be ordering additional sets for holiday gifts for all my foodie friends.  We all adore Nigella. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Smooth,These sheets are the best sheets I've ever owned. I don't know why anyone would ever go back to 200 thread count sheets when you can get these at such a deal.  They are so smooth and feel so relaxing
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,WOW...It really works,"Being the kid at heart that I am, I HAD to try out my new 'toy' the minute I got it. I followed the directions, and a room-temperature (Alabama room-temperature) can of soda was perfectly chilled all the way through in less than 5 minutes. This will be a life saver in the Summer down here."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Great, except for the metal lid handle","I got the pot in the espresso color when it was on sale for $6x.xx.  I do like how the pot has very simple lines, I think it would look nice in a traditional as well as a more modern looking kitchen.  I also feel that the lack of ridges on the outer part of the pot is a positive aspect since it actually makes cleaning it easier.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised with how nicely made it was and how well it performed.  I felt like I got a very good deal for the amount of $ spent.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works for me,"I got this because i've been having problems with my back sleeping. I'll tell you now that the other reviewer was right about the size. Its a few inches smaller than a Queen, I think its intentional so it fits under your sheets. I bought a queen for my full size bed and just trimmed it down a lil bit for a perfect fit. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Wine-o who loves this opener!,This wine opener is wonderful! I have used many openers since I began drinking wine and this by far is the easiest one I have ever put my hands on. In 2 seconds the bottle is uncorked - it's that easy! And wow - for the price??? How can you beat that? I highly recommend this product
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,Excellent Buy,Fabulous and beautiful glasses at just a fraction of the cost at a dept. store.  I would definitely recommend
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Nice quality,"Well made and attractive in person as well. Very good price, too - many places sell for around $30"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 11,2.0,Not as good as the Braun Multiquick,"I was going to buy this stick blender, and then I read a review with some troubling info, so I switched to the Braun Multiquick, and I'm really glad I did."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Stellar Steamer,"I purchased this steamer after reading and comparing many different models.  I have found it to live up to all of my expectations.  I was even very amazed at how well it worked in conjunction with the crease attachment on dress shirts and pants.  I would highly recommend this steamer to anyone who loves a fast solution to the drab chore of ironing. You plug it in and within minutes it is up and ready to go.  So, go ahead, enjoy wrinkle removal!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,Good looking - poor performance,"Looks nice, pretty colors, solid, heavyweight.  But, after a few months my opener began to function poorly, the mechanism seemed to have loosened and it wouldn't open some cans.  Now it doesn't work at all and I've thrown it out.  I'm disappointed in this expensive, good-looking, but, unexpectedly poor performing product."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,good new technology,"The Good:  even heating & I have yet to burn anything even the edges, the muffins came out pretty easily as long as I gave a few minutes of cooling time (tempting not to since you want to bake batch #2 asap), moderately priced, easy cleanup, flexible & lightweight for storage."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Do bot buy. LCD screen failed on 2 thermometers.,I bought 2 thermometers within the last 2 years. 
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Very Good!,The thermometer clips conveniently to the frothing pitcher and reacts almost instantly to the temperature of the milk.  It's not easy to know just where and at what angle to clip it so you'll be able to see the dial while you're frothing.  But very good nontheless
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,GREAT CONVIENIENCE,I ONLY NEED A FEW CUBES AT A TIME SO THIS IS PERFEC
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Great slow cooker,"After my old Rival slowcooker stopped working, i decided to get one that didn't boil or run so hot.  And I wanted a bigger one."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Fabulous Dutch Oven,"I love this dutch oven!  I've used it several times now, and every time the meat comes out juicy & succulent.  It seems to be extremely well made, and cleans up in a snap. I bought the Espresso color..it's beautiful!  I do find that the inside of the pot (which is cream-colored) tends to retain a slight ring of discoloration from the cooking liquid. I was concerned at first, but a tiny amount of Soft Scrub with a gentle sponge (NEVER use a scratchy cleanser) takes it right off no problem. And if you use a whisk, make sure it's silicone-coated or it will leave silver marks in the bottom of the pot (but again, the Soft Scrub will take it off).  This dutch oven is a VERY good value"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Great oven, with shut off timer, but","Very easy to use and clean and setup and nice looking. This oven will accomodate a full size dinner plate inside, where most toaster ovens will not. The shutoff timer is really great. The only drawback for us is that it needs some insulation. You can pre- heat your dinner plates on top of this oven, no need to put them inside. I suppose that all toaster ovens are like this, they get hot on the outside too. Somewhat a waste of energy, but more efficient than heating a full 30 inch oven to heat something small. We are pleased though, but room for improvement, like everything else, except my Wife"
kitchen & housewares,25 of 27,4.0,Summer savior,"This drink mixer is a great thing to have in summer when it's hot, though I've also used it in winter. But for making summery ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper, or even non-alcoholic shakes and malts, this mixer rules.  It's easy to use and durable enough to use over and over throughout an  afternoon or an evening. Just be sure you have enough ingredients, because  after you hand out the first drink, everyone is going to want one"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"waiting for previous edition to quit , to buy this one !","i have an old one that looks just like this, 2""x2.25"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,This skillet is marvelous - I never put it away,We use it to cook breakfast and/or dinner almost every day. It sits on top of the stove. It washes like a dream in seconds. The skillet cooks food evenly and not too fast. The cheap one we were using before would get too hot and burn things. Food doesn't burn in this one. It's also huge and we like that a lot! The extra handle is wonderful for carrying it around. Wonderful design. Don't forget to buy a glass lid to go with it.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Very poor nonstick,Design of this pot is excellent but the nonstick comes off easily(very soft). Did the makers ever test their product?
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Simply Works,"This is a sturdy masher that makes short work of potatoes.  I wished it were a little less expensive, but it does its job well and looks like it will last a long time.  I like the round mashers better than the wire versions because they reach the edges of the pan more completely"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 17,5.0,A Great Pot at a Great Price,"Compared with the prices of other pieces in the collection, this pot is a steal! It cooks evenly,and cleans easily. What more can you ask for? I traded in my old Revere copper bottom set for Tri-ply and love it. Even the more expensive pieces are definately worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 11,5.0,My new favorite pot!,Everything that has been said is true - it cooks (everything) beautifully.  I've only had one small problem - storing the lid upside down on top of the pot will scratch the enamel unless you store it with a towel or waxed paper in between.  I'm saving my money to buy a whole set
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Presto's Electric Skillet  tops the others!,"Presto's Electric Skillet and Server is one of the best! I use electric skillets quite frequently in cooking I find that Presto's electric skillet cooks evenly, washes easily and resists scratches better than the other brands. Reasonably priced, it is a good deal for everyday cooking needs"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,"Does what it claims, but takes forever","This product does what it claims.  I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well.  The downside of the product is the size.  It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it.  They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more.  I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator.  I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal.  It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Versatile tool in my kitchen for over 8 years,"I bought this griddle over 8 years ago for $39. It has been very useful with my electric stove for making many pancakes, burgers, grilled cheese, etc. I can cook 5-6 pancakes at a time, burgers & buns together, 4 grilled cheese sandwiches. Unlike the non-stick model 3560 also listed on this site, you can use this over high heat without any damage to it. Unlike the other review, I don't find it hard to clean. Over time, it retains some darkness of color (reminds me of cast iron), but it is not as heavy nor do you have the rust issues. Cleanup is easy with my blue Scotch-Brite multi-purpose scrub sponge. I'm planning on buying one for my sister and was delighted to find the same griddle available"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,2.0,Sateen Sheets,The sheets were a good quality material. The thing that I didn't like about them is when I washed them they shrunk. The top sheet is too small to tuck in
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Great all around blanket,"This is a fantastic blanket for the couch. I agree with the previous reviewer in that this blanket is not too heavy and not too light. I just use it all the time when I'm watching a movie or reading a book. The blanket is pretty soft, but not the softest blanket out there. But for the price it's an excellent value. It defiantly doesn't scratch or agitate my skin."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,use it every day,"I bought my bread machine a few weeks ago and I use it every day. The white and rye bread recipes turn out perfectly every time.  I've also made an apple cake and two meatloafs.  I tried one wheat bread loaf ... it was very tasty, but not quite the consistency that I like ... so I need to play around with that one alittle bit.   I've never been a cook and definitely have never baked a loaf of bread before ... but now that my kids are grown up, I now have some time to work in the kitchen.  I highly recommend this machine"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Egg & Muffin Toaster,My son is a carpenter who loves to cook.  I bought this item to not only save him time in the morning but also to cook a meal that he only has to add fruit too.  This is a Christmas present
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best Coffee Possible,"This will change the way you drink coffee.  Don't worry, it doesn't take much time to brew the coffee.  It takes about six minutes for me.  I have unplugged my drip coffee maker over six months ago.  Makes a perfect amount of coffee for my fianc� and I to take to work in the morning. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great product!,I really like this can opener because it doesn't take any additional space in my kitchen and it has the strength of my kitchen aid mixer.  It's a nice heavy steal and does the job great. 
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,WARPED - A Couple of My All-Clad Pieces Warped ,"I've had this pan for years and I use it maybe a couple of times a month.  I probably have 12 pieces of all-clad and I don't cook everyday.  Many of my pans, including this one, are beginning to WARP.  After having researched this on the web (lots of people have this problem) and learning that even if I had registered them (warranty) they are too old.  I was informed by the company that warping is a sign of misuse - hmmm, I used mine to cook with."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,DO NOT TRUST- mine EXPLODED,"Last night I measured 4 cups of boiling water into this pyrex dish to pour into a recipe, poured the water and set it down on the counter.  As I started to walk away it sounded like a gunshot.  The glass was all over in a 5 foot radius.  I just got this measuring cup for x-mas, it is new.  Just do a search for exploding pyrex and you will see that I am not the only one this has happened to with newer pyrex.  I am just glad it didn't explode with the boiling water in it, and burn my feet or my dogs. Buyers Beware!!!"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Beautiful!,"These are extremely beautiful. Very ""classy"" Looking, more so than simple plain copper cannisters Ive seen.  I Have the Granite Counter (BROWN/TAN) and these go very well with it.  I am Pleased with the quality, and the Look of these.  If Youre looking to ""class"" up the kitchen , this is the way to go.  The Only Thing I did not like was having to remove, the Handles and Put back on correctly.  (they have to put them on upside down to pack correctly I guess) It would be easy for most people, But I ended up scratching the inside, with the darn screwdriver trying to get them Off!  Other than That THEY ARE GREAT. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great item!,Having problems hanging your family photos?  This is the perfect product and inexpensive.  Sooooooo easy...
kitchen & housewares,10 of 13,1.0,Buy a v-slicer instead,"I bought this mandoline as a present for my wife. I felt confident in my purchase after reading the reviews on amazon.  Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. We followed the instructions and the advice on amazon, but could not get this thing to work. Every food item we tried, hard or soft, big or small, got jammed. My wife has gone back to using her v-slicer, which functions well, but lacks the stainless appeal of this mandoline. Needless to say, I returned this item to amazon for a refund"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love my tea mug!,"This is the best tea mug! The lid keeps the tea hot while it's steeping, when the tea is ready the lid becomes the setting place for the infuser -- no mess! The mug itself is sturdy and the color is vibrant. It's so great that I had to buy some for friends."
kitchen & housewares,32 of 32,5.0,Wonderful Machine,"I like to enjoy a capuccino every morning, but I was a bit tired of the process of griding the beans, tamping, frothing, cleaning up, etc.  Also in an effort to save time, I decided to research a super autmoatic machine.  I wanted a quality machine that would froth milk for me, but I was not impressed with the Jura Capresso machines because they require extensive clean up and are, in my opinion, grossly overpriced."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,1.0,Quality Product?,As I removed the cardboard insert to wash it for the first time I was surprised to run my fingers and hand through it to notice sharp burs and rough edges. I expected a little better craftsmenship for the price. Hope my cakes slide out..
kitchen & housewares,10 of 12,5.0,Review by college student,I'm a trained sous chef who cooks alot at home when i'm not working or studying.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,Great vacuum at a great price,"I bought this vacuum based on a Consumer Reports review.  It's every bit as good as CR said, and the Amazon price is fantastic"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great for arthritic hands,"One of the easiest potato mashers for smashed, or mashed potatoes that my wife and I have ever tried.  It is so comfortable and fits round pots perfectly and you control the exact amount of mashing you need.  A great tool for someone as they get more mature"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 17,1.0,Amazon sucks,I ordered on nov 9 and now they tell me after 3 emails that it may not be delivered until jan 14th or after .. thats not the original 3-7 days they had on the site when i ordered.. hell i could build a kiln and make my own china before it gets her
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Design Flaw,"I don't understand how people can overlook any major issue which is not present in much cheaper coffee makers.  The spout on the carafe, regardless of how the carafe is placed, leaks steam which collects on the body of the coffee maker and drips all over the place.  It sizzles when it contacts the warmer plate, which is an unsettling sound, and it collects on the counter top ... the more time the more water that appears.  And the carafe looks just plain goofy to me.   I also have the Bunn, which has coffee grounds coverage issues (you will see dry untouched areas if you make a very small pot), the Bunn is a superior product in my opinion."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 14,1.0,Excellent,This pots and pans are very good and easy to clean.  They were definitely worth the purchase
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great Product - Just Love It,Pros:
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Outstanding toaster oven updated 11/22/06,"After owning several totally lousy Black and Decker toaster ovens over the years, my wife and I went on an expedition to find a GOOD toaster oven. We had limited space...16 inches wide and not too deep to fit on a small piece of counter next to our stove. Went to several stores to see more junk. If they were not junk they were WAY too big and impractical. I Googled the best toaster ovens and discovered this T-Fal. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Solid product that is easy to clean,My husband and I purchased the Krups citrus juicer when we went on the Lemon Juice diet. This little machine made squeezing lemons a breeze. I really liked how easy it was to clean. The body of the machine stays secure on granite countertops and the motor is strong enough to get every bit of juice.
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Cinnabar is a beautiful table piece,I gave this piece to my wife for Mothers Day - it was a big hit. The cinnabar has a hot look that makes hot food even more appealing on the table. It matches our Arts and Crafts era home
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Emile Henri coffee mugs,Emile Henri has a superb line of table ware and these coffe mugs are no exception.  Brilliantly hued and durable. 
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Looks and feels cheap,"This set of tiny tools is a rip-off. It looks and feels cheap with all the handles made of cheap plastic. You can clearly see the bumps on both sides of the jigger. That shows you the craftsmanship, or lack of it to be correct. I guess the formula now is to give a fancy european name to a lousy product and put it on the Internet with a hefty price. Buyers have no idea of its actual size just by looking at the picture. Also few people want to go through the hassle to return stuff purchased online. Stay away, you have been warned"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,SImply Calphalon is OK stuff.,"It's not as heavy as their commercial line, but it still transfers heat well enough.  This pot is great for roasts, and fits a whole chicken perfectly.  The lid fits well, too"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,5.0,Fondue makes a Fabulous Gift!,"We received this fondue set as a gift last year and we love it. It's great for dinner parties and a lot of fun! The best thing about it is that it can do cheese, broth and/or chocolate, most pots are one or the other. Also, the sterno canisters can be bought at your local store, probably in some sort of camping or bbq aisle"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Easy to use and usually works...,"When it works the food savers are great - easy to use and they dont use a lot of space. However, I have had a problem with the cannisters losing their suction for no apparent reason. When they work, they work well. I especially like them for storing coffee."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great Product,Very nice and easy to take care of.  A great product.  I am very pleased with this purchase
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Star of the table,"I've been making summer salads, in a large stainless mixing bowl. The wife saw this on sale at Amazon and bought it as a surprise. It's been a table star. I usually wouldn't like something this ornate, but the scale of the bowl is so large that the pattern (inside and out) looks good.  A winner"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,"Very good, but not superior","Works very well, ergonomically, but after a few uses it showed a bit of melting at the leading edge--which is unusual b/c I did not let it sit in the pan.  However, I still highly recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,A big help!!,"Lets face it, using a grater can be dangerous but this is great! It has really saved my fingers from the sharp blades.  You have to get this if you have these graters!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent Quality and Price,"I am very happy with it: inexpensive, easy to clean and nice-looking. Highly recommend"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,My favorite piece of cookware,"Everything that has been said about this pot is true - nicely looking, comfortable handles, no hot spots, thick bottom (can put it on a small burner and it still heats evenly).  I bought it when Amazon was selling it for $20 and it is the best purchase I've made for my kitchen so far"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Very Satisfied - Great Product,"This steamer is a lot better than my old Black & Decker, lighter, easier to clean, and actually costs less than the B & D did 8 years ago! Has many great features but the best thing is you can walk away without worrying about food burning or sticking. This is a healthier alternative and safer to use than a microwave. Easy cleanup too"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Good for the price....,"This set isn't perfect, but they are easy to maintain, just wash in dishwasher.  The small ones slip a little on the granite, but not so bad you can't use them.  Overall, for the money paid for this set, I'm satified."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Satisfied Pyrex customer,"After reading many reviews of disappointment with the Cobalt Blue line of Pyrex products I have to say I am very satisfied with this product. Though I mostly use it for cold or room temperature servings, I cannot completely claim this product is 100% perfect. It works for me and that is all I really care about"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great cookware set,"I purchased this cookware set about 1 year ago. My husband and I are both big cookers, eating in at least 6 days per week. I tried one of the stainless skillets first and was very disappointed at how everything we cooked stuck and left stains. Ended up purchasing this set and have been very pleased. Nothing sticks, very easy and quick to wash up. Coulding be happier. The set is very sturdy and I anticipate this being the last set of cookware I will need to purchase"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 13,5.0,Perfect,"This looks even better in person. It is so soft and luxurious!I love it. The tag says it's from mervyns and was only $99. That's still 50% off and for a Cal-king there is no better deal out there, especially one as nice as this. Great quality"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"great product, great price","product works exactly as described, and the price was reasonable.  their support line was also friendly and fast. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Sees a lot of action,"I love this pot.  I've used it for boiling, making ice cream bases, etc.   I occasionally use it to fry a serving of beignets. All Clad provides superior heat technology for quick and even heating.  The stay-cool handle is a plus.  Cleans up quickly in the dishwasher.  A little polish keeps it looking like new"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"If you have a 12-cup, wait for the KFP7JE ",The KFP7JE will be compatible for larger food processors such as the 12 cup but is not yet available as of 23Feb05. The KFPJE is NOT compatible with the 12 cup food processor
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great press,"The more I use it, the more I like it."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great for travel and light steaming,I have owned this iron for about three years now and I use it every week still. It is great for quick steaming of sweaters and quick ironing in the morning. Not great for stubborn wrinkles or delicate fabrics but that is not what its true purpose is. It is wonderful to throw in your suitcase for traveling. Just remember to keep cleaner on hand and clean it regularly.I recommend this iron for any business traveler
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Unexpectedly useful tool,"In a typical kitchen, any tool-purchasing decision should consider four things: (1.) the breadth of uses, (2.) affordability, (3.) the relative storage space required, and (4.) the performance quality of the tool in question.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,1.0,Large Disappointment,"I used it about three times before I had to return it to the store.  The entire over would get hot, including the glass of the front door.  The oven rank would slide on its own and fall on the open glass door, spilling all my food...d'oh!  The heat was also very weak; it took ten minutes to cook what it takes three minutes on the stove.  I was so disappointed because it looked sturdy and I have good luck with their other products. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,I've used mine a million times,"This IS a kitchen essential.  I have two.  This is the pot you grab for every little thing: heating up a can of soup, frozen veggies, straining gravy in to, anything.  This and the next size up, are musts in every kitchen.  Cleans easily and stays nice and shiny.  I got all of mine years ago for a wedding present and it was my favorite present and still is, I use them always.  I have since acquired Le Creuset and All-Clad, and I love them too, but THESE are the tried and true pots you don't have to think about damaging or how do I clean it, or will I scratch it.  Good buy for the money too"
kitchen & housewares,30 of 30,4.0,"Wonderful product, even though it's specialized","The only reason why this doesn't get the last star, in my book, is because of its somewhat limited usefulness.  However, if you live in an apartment or otherwise anywhere where grilling is impossible, this is the next best thing....like all other Le Creuset products this heats evenly and wonderfully and takes abuse.  I got mine as part of a 6-piece set (along with a Dutch Oven, Baking Pan, and Casserole) and sorta at first saw this as a &quot;filler&quot; piece.  However, to it's credit, this pan can do even easilly-burned items like tofu dogs and fake bacon WONDERFULLY, which shocked me--I was convinced that nothing could give a &quot;grilled&quot; effect to those items. I even got adventerous the first time I used it and grilled some apple rings.  I panicked when some sugar seemed to be burnt on for good despite a good soaking, but after the pot had been dried and put away for 48 hours it flaked right off.  Forget what you know about nonstick surfaces, btw, and banish those bad memories of cruddy, flaking Teflon from the 70's.  Just treat this well (I only use wooden utensils on it) and it will treat you well.  Follow the instructions and enjoy!  Just be sure to use a potholder and realize that once this thing gets hot it STAYS hot for a LONG time"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Works well but seal gets dirty,"These were some of the first thermal tumblers on the market. I bought one back in 1995 and it has worked well over the years. I use it almost every day at the office and rinse it out at the end of the day and let it dry overnight. The rubber seal gets dirty after a while and needs to be removed to be properly cleaned. I sip tea slowly, sometimes right up until lunch and this tumbler does a great job of keeping beverages warm for a long period of time. Alas, after 11 years of use the seal has finally given out and I must find a replacement. I will probably purchase this same model again."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Delonghi AR 1070 Convestion Oven,"I award this 4 stars for what it is:  a convenient and portable extra oven to supplement  my one wall-oven kitchen.  I think of it as a ""toaster-oven-plus."" The convection feature is not as fast as in a regular built-in convection oven, because this model only has one fan.  But it is useful as an adjunct to my wall oven, and  its temperature gauge is more reliable than a regular toaster oven.  Its rotisserie is definitely a great way to cook roast chicken.  All in all , I give it a ""4."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,A Great Little Machine,This machine is fantastic for the spot/small areas.  It's so easy to use and it cleans up quickly and easily
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect! Works great on all cheeses!,"I have used this to grate dried peppers, parmesean, romano, cheddar, pepperjack, and goat cheese. I have to completely disagree with previous negative reviews. I bought this for the gripiness. Little did I know that it does do it all. It works on hard cheeses and soft cheeses. If you don't manhandle it, it will not break...just like most THINGS on this planet. Don't force it. Grind it backwards a couple of times once in a while. That loosens things up a little. Let the grinder do the work. Forcing will break it and is not necessary. It disassembles and washes up great on the top shelf of the dishwasher. The best feature is the ability to keep your cheese fresh while in the refrig. Smart item, easy to use, a great buy and highly recommended."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Fits any size space,"Excellent value, sturdy and can be configured to fit any space -I use mine under cabinets in a pantry in a very tight space that I could not find any other wine rack to fit! Also, you can build on what you have already purchased as your collection grows"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,no box,This came inside a plastic bag inside a box - just keep that in mind if you are sending it as a gift. Otherwise - great pan!
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,THIS THING IS TOAST!,Seemed like a good buy when I bought it. Upscale price for a toaster but it had so many features it seemed fair. But my gosh - it can't make a decent piece of toast! It overtoasts everything or undertoasts it so that you have to put it back down at which point it.....overtoasts it!
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,What a great feeling!,This sheet set is exactly that..soft and cuddly! Just the perfect thing on a great budget. Highly recommend them
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,this coffeemaker has mojo,"I have had this coffee maker for 5 years and it still works great.  I did break the glass carafe once in a freak accident but was able to get a replacement one through Krups.  Anyway I am very happy with it, it's affordable and easy to operate.  The built is water filter is nice but I must admit that I haven't used a filter in awhile, although I do plan on ordering replacement filters.  It's a nice option to have but the coffeemaker works just fine without them too.  "
kitchen & housewares,33 of 34,5.0,"Beautiful, powerful and quiet!","I received this processor in remarkably short time and have been exceptionally impressed by the quality and performance.  It is a large machine.  I was surprised by the size and weight, but it still manages to fit on the counter under the cabinets and looks wonderful."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Best fondue pot I've used,"I used 6 different styles of fondue pot.  This one is definately the best.  Because it's made of cast iron, scorching is minimized.  Chocolates and cheeses melt wonderfuly.  Controlling the heat works better than others I've used."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Nice for the price,"Very nice blanket.  Soft and warm.  My only complaint:  I bought two (for two twin beds) both in China blue,and there was a slight color varitation. Doesn't affect quality but it would have been nice to have the same color. If you are only buying one, or buying for separate rooms, I recommend this blanket"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Excellent Boner!,This is by far the best boner I've ever had. The handle fits me perfectly & the blade is the perfect length/shape. The metal is excellent quality & keeps an edge very well. This knife is very easy to control & manuver with any kind of cooked or raw meat. Will replace w/same if lost/stolen
kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,5.0,Love it.,"I looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one.  I chose the Flip-It for the price which was much lower and for the size.  This unit if very light weight and easy to store and tote around.  I felt like the larger cleaner would be too much trouble to drag in and out. I have wood floors in the kitchen, nook, and foyer and I can clean the entire area with one tank and still have a little left over. It's not any faster than mopping but it's much easier.  My floors really clean and who wouldn't love that"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 10,1.0,"Lousy, threw mine out","I love their wine saver product, and use that all the time; what a great gadget! And I drink a lot more coffee than wine, and am at least as sensitive to the quality, so this sounded pretty promising.  Unfortunately, I found it didn't work worth a darn. I was never able to get it to hold a seal satisfactorily, and so the whole effort of using this became a waste. Almost any container (ziploc, tupperware, mason jar, etc.) would be better.  Sorry to say that, because the idea has promise and I like their other product quite a bit. I would recommend not getting this, based on my experience"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 16,2.0,Deceptive Description,"This item is advertised as having a 5-Cup Blue Chill GLASS Freezer Jar.  It is PLASTIC. Since we were specifically looking for a blender with a glass jar, this does not suit our needs"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great little machine,"I really like this deep fryer, with one exception. It really is quite small for a family of 4. Its pluses though make up for it at times. It is ALL dishwasher friendly including basket and body and the drainer works really easily. A great little machine as long as size isn't the main feature you're looking for"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,5.0,Let me tell you this ...,"Quite frankly, I am one of those guys that will check out the reviews, but not give one.  I have to give a review on this knife.  It is simply incredible.  Wusthof is certainly a well known and established manufacturer of fine cutlery, but this particular knife is the best everyday knife you will ever use.  Go try it.  You will agree and then tell your family and friends about it."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Down Blanket,"This is a beautiful, high-quality down blanket at a very good price. It's light enough for a warm evening, and it's warm on a chilly night. It remains to be seen how it will hold up to washing or dry cleaning, but I have every reason to expect it will be fine."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,1.0,THIS SLOW COOKER IS AWFUL!  COOKS TOO HOT,"Slow Cookers should do just that....slowly cook over a long period of time without the meat/chicken/etc. drying out.  Both times I used it resulted in overly cooked chicken and beef on the LOW setting.  The juices were boiling, which shouldn't be the case on LOW heat.  It will be returned...I'm planning on replacing it with the West Bent 84765"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,5.0,WAITING FOR THE SALE,"I HAVE ONE OF THESE POTS THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT. IT WORKS WELL AND CLEANS VERY EASILY. SMALL 1 QT. CAPACITY IS IDEAL SOR THE SMALLER PORTIONS OF SPECIALIZED FOOD BEING PREPARED. WAITING FOR THIS TO GO ON SALE AGAIN AT UNDER $ 10.00 AND I WILL BUY 5 MORE. IT IS A VERY GOOD, CHEAP, FULLY FUNCTIONAL POT WHEN NOT ABUSED WITH HARSH CLEANING"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Takes care of business.,"It warms your cup and keeps it warm all day long.  Although it does not have an automatic shut off, it's still a great little unit for the money.  Grab one up for a co-worker"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Hamilton Beach water filter,Need the product for coffee pot.  Service from Amazon was excellent.  Ordered item online as I could not find it at any local store even thought various stores carry the coffee pot
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,This is the most economical set anywhere,"I looked everywhere for a matching set of sushi plates and accessories.  This is the one I got.  I checked out other sets, and they really came up in price.  I got 2 of these, along with noodles 2 GO bowls that match"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Ronco knife holder is GREAT!!!,"I purchased the Ronco knife set for my fiance for Christmas (we both love to cook) and he has been wanting them for a long time.  I got them at a discount store but the knife block was not included.  It's a huge knife set so what to do???  I looked on Amazon.com of course and as usual they did NOT let me down.  They had the knife block at the lowest price I could find.  It is a large block that has slots for all the Ronco knives plus several extra slots for other of your ""favorites"".  It came in a ridiculously short period of time (I think like 2 days after I placed the order).  Amazon.com is great.  I can't say enough nice things about the company!!! "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Terrible,"As someone had written before, the lid won't stay on (and we don't have a dishwasher!) In addition, the label on inside bottom was almost impossible to remove."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Not a bad deal,"Like other reviewers have said, the slicing guide makes it easy to cut straight, uniform slices, and I just slice as many as I need at a time.  I think the rest of the loaf stays a little fresher that way.  "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Lovely,"No matter how much you look at something on your computer, it's always a surprise when you actually see it .  The bowls are classy, with clean lines, have a good weight to them, and come with a finish of a combination of a glaze and matte finish, mostly matte. They're so worth the price, and "

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Holds Vacuum on wine for weeks,"I've had this product for 3 or 4 years, adn keep loosing the stoppers, but I keep buying more because it does a great job of sealing a $20 bottle of wine, and keeping a vacuum in the bottle for weeks - ie: no air- no oxidation = continued great wine. This way I can dring a glass of good wine any night, and have the rest whenever I like."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Great feel & balance, nice performance","OK, so [...] is a lot to pay for a cheese knife; but if you are buying a really nice present for someone, especially a cheese lover, this is a good choice.  Right out of the package, the smooth feel and excellent balance of this knife impressed me.  And for the right kind of cheese, in this case the semi-hard cheeses (e.g. Asiago, Jarlesberg, Emmenthaler or Cheddar all work) the performance is very good.  The handle is long enough to give you a good purchase to slice effectively, and to make nice slices without the cheese sticking too much.  It did not work so well on a very hard piece of aged Pecorino Toscano we had, but then, the Parmesan knife is probably a better choice for a hard cheese like that; I would also imagine that it would not be great bfor soft sheeses either, and again, they have another [...] knife for that too.  But I suspect this one has the most uses of the series"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 19,5.0,Works as advertised.,"I use this pan for bacon and eggs, just for the two of us.  I let it preheat a little so that the pan is completely hot.  I put bacon on one end and eggs on the other.  I put a big round glass lid over the bacon so that it doesn't splatter.  It's perfect for cooking up bacon for a crowd if we have company.  It sits perfectly flat against the stove top, which is my ceramic stove top requires.  It's great for breakfast, grilled sandwiches, hamburgers for a crowd, etc.  I've owned a number of griddles over the years and the Calphalon griddle is my favorite"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,5.0,Great Coffee!,"This coffee system makes great coffee and good sense.  Brew only what you want, tastes wonderful, and no wasted coffee.  I would highly recommend both the coffee system and the seller"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A great way to make a sandwich,"This kitchen gadget adds a new twist to making sandwiches.  It's so easy to be creative.  Even if you just make a grilled cheese, it's better tasting then on the stovetop. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,I would purchase again,"I used my moms, and I was sold....so I purchased mine.  I then loved it so much more, I came back and purchased 3 more for gifts.  Its a great idea and very handy.  I have to admit, I am one of those that used a stationary until the blade got nasty (you can only keep it clean so long) then I would throw it away and buy another $10 one....not a problem any longer with this...the blade comes right off...not worries"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,NOT WORTH IT!,"I bought this sifter and washed before I used it. The bottom strainer part came undone, so I pushed it back into place, except it wouldn't go back in the right spot, so everytime I shook it side to side, it wouldn't sift, because the metal piece that slides back and forth to sift wasn't touching the bottom strainer part anymore. Needless to say, it went back and I got the old fashioned kind with the squeeze handle"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,review of velocity Blizzard Fran,It was really hot the day it arrived and I wasn't optimistic that it would be strong enough to make a difference in my sweltering apartment. I turned it on and it really was a blizzard of air and I felt so relieved I could have cried. Great great fan
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Very nice little pan,"I'm very pleased with both the quality and size of this pan. The handles are easy to grasp. The lid fits snugly. I have used it to hard-boil eggs and to heat spaghetti sauce. It performed well each time I used it. The price was outstanding, making this an affordable way to try out the Farberware Cuisine series"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A Must Read!,"We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners.  They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking.  We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet.  We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews.  I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America.  I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together.  We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack.  I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job.  Ok...our Hoover came.  My husband put it together and it leaked all over.  I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them.  By then we had already taken it to the repair center.  After a week they had not touched it.  My husband picked the machine up  and brought it home.  We decided to start from square one and put it together again.  He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!!  Yeah!  My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman.  So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,2.0,Watch out for that non-stick coating!,I purchased this slow cooker because it has such a good review from flylady.com.  
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,You can mix cement with this.,This blender is amazing.  First it will blend anything in under 5 seconds.  Second it is so easy to clean up.  The design lends itself to truly a swipe of a damp cloth gets it done.  The lid is perfect for keeping everything in.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,An extra bowl is so handy!,Having this extra bowl really comes in handy. No more mid-prep cleanup of your bowl so you can mix up the second element of your confection or meal.
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Love this bowl in white,"I own this bowl in white and use it strictly for a fruit bowl. The pedestal isn't too high and suits my casual kitchen perfectly. I could possibly see this as a serving piece but it is a bit shallow and personally I would not use it for that. I am looking to other Fiesta pieces, specifically bowls, to use as serving pieces.   "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Quality travel iron,"I bought this iron hesitantly because I wanted one that was also a vertical steamer, but since I have been here in Spain for three weeks I cannot complain.  The iron with the adaptor works perfectly with the 230 voltage here and the heat is just right.  It is the same quantity of heat that I had in the US and it is sufficent to crease jeans and slacks as well as press dress shirts and other items.  It also serves as a steam and dry iron.  There is a removable steam tank as well as a spray mechanism in the handle,  I recommend it.  It comes with a handy travel pouch and an adaptor with a container to put water in the steam tank"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent knife,"I used to watch my mom use a kife similar to this when I was a kid. I never new what it was for so when I saw it after purchasing other Henkels knives thru the years, I decided to give it a try. I use it for everything, especially peeling and cutting fruit and vegetables. A great knife and now I see why my mom used hers so much so many years ago"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,The Le Crueset 4 1/2 quart Round French Oven,"I've read the other reviews and agree that this is a most useful tool to have in my kitchen.  It washes up beautifully and the cream colored inside is easier to check for spots than the dark non stick ovens.  I like the fact that the oven holds its heat for a good long time after the food is cooked enabling me to use the attractive utensil to serve from at the table and to leave for guests to take seconds from without reheating. I've had no trouble with cracking or chipping, but then I take care not to abuse it.  My son is getting one for Christmas from me, what else can I say"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Fantastic Present for Someone,"I have always loved blue glass and finally went for it. I received the set that was, carefully packed. They are everything I hoped. I am very satisfied. Sturdy without feeling clunky. If this set was sold in a gift shop, it would be $100.00 dollars. Treat them like they are antiques, and someday they will be. Some people have complained about breakage. If they break these, they will break any glass.. Libbey hit a home run with these. Absolutely Beautiful"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Revere Copper Bottom Teakettle,"This is an excellent teakettle. We purchased it as an identical replacement for a Revere Teakettle that we have used for over 50 years. The old Teakettle developed a leak at the seam between the top and bottom, probably as a result of ignoring the manufacturer's instructions to never place it on a burner larger than the teakettle's bottom or on a burner turned on high! It lasted all these years anyway. We have always found the capacity to be just right and ordered online when I couldn't find a replacement in a local store"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,love it love it love it!,i can't say anything bad about this toaster. it has an amazing design and it does the job just like any good toaster. i love it
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,4.0,Very good,I've used this pot a couple of times since I've bought it for both cheese and chocolate fondues.  Overall I'm very pleased.  The food is cooked quickly and the clean up time is very fast and easy.  The magnet holding the heating cord is genius.  When it gets too hot simply remove the cord.  
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Silpat Baking Mat,Works wonderfully.  Nothing sticks and food comes off very easily.  Also use it to roast vegetables which seem to come out moister.  Easy to clean
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Lodge lasts forever,"I'm still using the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet that my mother got for a wedding present in 1954! I give one as as wedding gifts, housewarming gifts, and to those kids stepping out into their own apartments. Cast Iron is ALWAYS a superior value for the money.  Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet and Dutch Oven! She'll hand it down to the next generation. A must have for EVERY kitchen "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Oxo Stainless Small Scoop Colander,"This one Oxo stainless scoop/colander has replaced two old-style mesh strainers, as well as a worn out slotted cooking spoon, in my kitchen cabinets!  It is easy to use and clean (dishwasher safe)and the scoop is long-lasting stainless with the Oxo handle that is comfortable and provides a good grip.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,I'm getting rid of mine,"Even on the lowest setting (""WARM"") this thing boils and thus eventually burns anything you put in it.  I got this as a Christmas Gift last year and I wish I would have used it sooner so I could've returned it.  You cannot touch the lid once the unit is hot or you will get burned.  (By the way, the lid is glass.  How stupid is that?) The outside casing doesn't stay too cool either. I guess for the price you get what you pay for.  So, I'm goiong to give mine away"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,This is used daily in my kitchen,"A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian food for the last 10 years, writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are ""The Professional Chef"" by the Culinary Institute and ""Culinary Artistry.  Cooking is my form of therapy.  I purchased this product when I began using citrus juice in many of my meals.  This product is very useful and has many more applications than just straining juice."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,2.0,"Wonderful product, but needs improvement!","Silicone baking pans are extremely cool.  Light and flexible, they store easily and don't deform even if you accidentally leave something heavy on them, and you can just peel them off your finished baked good.  Since they cool down quickly, you can lift them without potholders after ~5 minutes out of the oven.  Plus, I get that thrilling ""the future is now"" feeling whenever I use them, and sometimes I bake solely in order to be able to use the pan because it's just so cool."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Kuhn Rock-On!,"I am a kitchen gadget snob, not easily impressed.  This product not only impressed me, it changed my life.  I feast on the finest foods from around the world and the ability to passionately lick every last morsel from my cans nary a worry of shrapnel lacerations is enough to send me into a frenetic tribal-like dance!  If the operator has half a brain no metal could ever get into their fetas, hearts of palm or escargot.  The opener cuts to the exterior of food, in the seal area of the can, where the metal is doubled over.  I have never seen a sharp edge anyway, having washed all our cans for recycling.  In more than a year it has yet to show any signs of wear.  The BEST on the market"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 24,5.0,I LOVE this mill!,"I've had this mill for a few months and it's wonderful.  Not a speck of flour on my counter afterward.  It's fast and quieter than my vacuum cleaner.  It really does do SUPER fine flour all the way to cereal grain.  Easy cleanup, easy to store, great capacity.  I debated between the Nutrimill & Whisper Mill, but I'm glad I went with this one"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Waste of time and money,"An avid amateur chef (and gadget freak), deeply in love with my stand-mixer for baking, I thought this seemed like a good idea for our favorite quick salads like grated carrotts and apples etc. Unfortunately I am not impressed. Unless you make copious amounts of shredded veggies I think you are better off using a regular grating iron.  Any time you save cranking stuff through the shredder is quickly lost on clean-up.  Get a good grating iron instead, replace it when it gets dull. Be happy. My set is sitting in the back of a cabinet after only a few uses"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Rival Skillet,"I bought this skillet in March,2006. It worked great at first. It was such a breeze to clean. Last week I was making dinner in it and it completely shut off. Apparantly the motor burned up or something. Because I bought it on line I can not take it back to the store. If I want anything done I have to send it back to Rival in California and prepay all shipping charges plus handleing charges. Which they don't even say how much to send for this. I am very dissappointed with the whole thing and will think twice about ordering online again"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,great pans for the price,"these are very lightweight but a good deal for the price.  would not use high heat when using these.  they look nice and are easy to handle.  i am older and appreciate the light weight.  if you want something for heavy use and a big family, you dont want these unless you want them for small jobs.  would buy them again for the price"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,The perfect cheesecake pan!,"This pan is the best cheesecake pan I've used. My cheesecakes bake evenly and NEVER leak (I bought it to replace one that cost the same amount but leaked all over my oven). Highly recommend. I've never had anything burn on the bottom, so if you have that problem, have your oven calibrated, or make sure you put the pan in the center of the oven - not too close to the heating element. My cheesecakes come out perfectly every time. I will never buy another brand!"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Best Purchase,I keep the stone in my oven all the time.  I have always had a hard time cooking food in my oven because the oven is really old and unpredictable.  The stone has helped keep the temperature in the oven more consistent.  This product is a must have
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Best on the market,"Let me say there are a lot of little problems.  Poor lid, ugly, handles that come loose, and a little slow regaining heat.  But everything is redeemed because West Bend makes the best thermostat is the best on the market.  I've tried competitors like Rival, and Toastmaster.  Even high priced Cuisinart models but this is tops"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Handles my cooking very well.,This pot serves my needs well and is a good cooking pot
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Expected a lot and this grill surpassed my expectations.,"The only thing I would correct is an on/off switch, but I'm getting used to unplugging it as soon as I'm done"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very nice peeler and zester.,"I bought this about a year ago, even though I already own two other peelers. I've just never been happy with our other peelers though. They were both grocery store bought and they're just too skinny and wobbly. My hands would always ache after a short time. Peeling carrots for juice was basically torture. Well, not anymore! This thing is like the Cadillac of peelers. I can zip through a bag of carrots in no time at all. I even use it for peeling potatoes, which I'd always used a knife before. My mom fell in-love with it too, and I wound up buying the set for her for Christmas. The zester is also very nice. I've become very fond of Kitchen Aid's gadgets. They cost a little more, but I have found them to be rugged plus they feel good in your hands"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 12,2.0,Too Good To Be True,"This set does make a great first impression but, before you buy, you should know what you're getting.  I bought these as a gift for my mom and I wouldn't suggest buying these knives as a gift.  They'll embarass you.  The Amazon description is accurate, but what they don't say is substantial.  The knives look great, and really look like a quality forged set.  The packaging is your first hint that it isn't, though.  They're shipped in the actual packaging, which is plain cardboard.  The packaging is pretty good, but the plainness of it is reminiscent of those products bought in bulk quantities by flea market vendors.  The only marking is a reminder that they're made in China.  Inside, you find a pretty nice looking set, but the only documentation is an inkjet-printed, giftcard-style insert showing the Amazon cover-photo, a brief description and contents list.  It also reminds you they're made in China, and that they're exclusive to Amazon (aka generic.)  The actual knives also have the unusual generic-like quality of having no name printed on them.  Even most cheap knives say something."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 12,5.0,I love KITCHENAID!,I bought an eight inch skillet a few months ago and fell in love with it! So I decided to buy this set.  It was the cheapest place I could find it and it had free shipping. CAN'T BEAT THAT! They are the easiest to clean and nothing absolutely nothing sticks to it! Buy them you won't regret it
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,"Pie, maybe. Pastry, no.","This product seemed like it would be the answer to rolling out my delicate pastry doughs. However I didn't find it at all useful for this particular task and only served to add another level of aggravation. Though the pastry board got cool, that was about it. It didn't generate enough cold to keep the dough from softening at it's normal rate on my non-cooled rolling surface. I also had a problem with sticking unless I were to add a significant amount of flour which would have made the dough tough. I can see where this board might be better suited for pie doughs where a more heavily floured rolling surface would not be such a problem, and the measured circles are a handy reference, but for doughs containing a significant amount of butter it didn't meet my needs"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Sticky Sole Plate - Never Again!,"My wife and I both dislike this product.  Although I can manage to fill it, my wife dislikes the little slide-out water fill door.  We both found the ""non-stick"" soleplate problematic.  While it appears to works ok with most fabrics, we always end up with burnt residue on the soleplate (yucchh!).  We try to adjust the temperature, but the temperature dial is not very intuitive either.  We we're disappointed safety-wise as well.  I left the iron on, when we went out, and returned hours later to find it still hot!  Thankfully it was left upright on the ironing board, so no harm done, but could've been tragic.  We didn't pay a lot for the iron (around $30), but I'm sure we could've done better. just sign me ""Looking for a new iron"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,what is there to say?,"they work, they're afforable, and they make the L.A. tap water actually taste good. the only problem is that I go through them so fast because of how awful the tap water is out here... but who cares, it's worth it. much cheaper than buying bottled water"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 24,1.0,Excerpt from Cooks Illustrated,The following is copied from a review found in Cooks Illustrated Equipment Corner:
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Fantastic,Great blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple--only two speeds. Easy clean-up
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,great dishes,"Great set of dishes.  Sturdy, look nice, easy to clean.  Arrived quickly with no breaks. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Best appliance in my kitchen!,"I've got 'em all--kitchen-aid mixer, food processor, salad-spinner, slow-cooker, electric tea kettle. But this rice cooker has quickly become my favorite appliance. Measure water, measure rice, come back later (up to several hours later!) and you've got a perfect meal accompaniment. The softest, most perfectly cooked rice I've ever eaten--including in restaurants. The ease with which I can cook my rice, and then come back to throw some veggies in the steamer tray for 10 minutes while I'm finishing up my fish or meat on the grill, is not only a time saver, but a pot saver. So little to clean up! And, speaking of cleaning, the no-stick surface makes cleaning this little guy a snap."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,excellent pan and even better service,"My wife and I received the pans in this set for our wedding over 3 years ago.  They have been excellent despite very heavy use from us.  The non-stick still doesn't stick and there is almost no discoloration.  They are very easy to clean because the entire pan is non-stick, not just the inside.  The silicon on the handle does an excellent job of protecting your hand from being burnt even at high temperatures."
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,Don't touch,"Yeah, the bowls are pretty, but as fragile as an egg shell. My 8-inch diameter bowl was just broken and these piece-of-crap bowls are too expensive to replace. Good frickin luck with them"
kitchen & housewares,42 of 42,5.0,Back to the future...,"I'm not saying there isn't a place for bagless cleaners, but I got tired of the mess.  So I ordered this upright with bags and I love it!  The bags are much easier to change now - a snap -, it's light, cleans great. Best of all- I can store it in my clothes closet because it is so clean (the dirt is IN the bag, not on the cleaner). The bags and hepa filter are cheap.  When I figured it would cost me about $18 to get a new belt for my old vac - I thought I might as well buy a new one. So glad I did.  A great bonus is the POWER PAW...what a maniac that attachment is - the brush roller is great for pet hair and stairs. "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 15,5.0,Cadillac of cutting boards!,"This rectangular, end-grain cutting board by Calphalon is the best cutting board I have ever used.  It is super thick, easy on our expensive knives, totally non-slip, and easy to pick up and move.  The only thing about it that gave me a bit of trouble, was the first time I washed it before I used it, I got carried away and got too much water on it for too long.  Even though I dried it off, it bowed up pretty badly.  I turned it over so the board was resting on the bowed part, and left it alone, and in about one week it had dried back out and returned to it's original, level, beautiful condition.  Since then I have oiled it several times, and each time it gets prettier.  I have another, older and smaller wooden board that I use only for meats, fish, and poultry, and use the Calphalon board for veggies and breads and cheeses...in other words, for things that don't have the capability of transmitting bacteria as easily so I won't feel the need to wash it quite as vigorously as that first time.  It is pretty enough that it has a permanent place on the kitchen counter, and could certainly double as a serving platter at a casual party.  While the price might be a little steep, I don't foresee ever needing another cutting board again"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,Mine broke after limited use,"I must agree with the other negative reviewer. I used mine only to inject flavorings into CAKES-not a harder substance like raw beef or chicken-and it broke in 2 places after only 3 uses. And if you are using a thinner liquid as opposed to a thick marinade or sauce, the liquid simply pours out of the holes before you have a chance to inject it. Don't waste your money"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Super quality and love this cookware!  ,"As an ordinary person who only cooked to eat, not for pleasure, I am amazed at how this cookware has me actually loving to cook! I now can't wait to get out the cookware and try a new recipe. I am very pleased with the quality as well and the difference in the overall cooking and baking experience with this brand.  Food seems to have more flavor, cleanup is a breeze, even having to handwash the cookware.  Having bought those average Wal Mart brand pots and pans for almost thirty years having these to cook with everyday is a new pleasure!  This set and the bakeware set were my 28th wedding anniversary present and I am glad our daughter suggested them to me from seeing them on the cooking channel.  I was just about to buy anothe T Fal set from Wal Mart and am now glad I spent the extra money! "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 27,5.0,"This appliance reduced the mess in my kitchen, & @ the hotel","Keep it out of the sink!  But, with a careful hosing this will come clean and limit the shock value that comes with wet innards. My advice: clean it right after using it... don't let it sit too long or you'll have a chore in front of you. Nice 'tuff teflon finish to the grittles. A breeze to use, no splatter. I take it where ever I go (I'm a road warrior playing bass in a kickin' jazz/blues, R&B touring band). I used to cook soup in hotel coffee makers and at one point duct taped two chairs together with the complementary clothes iron wedged face up in between. Covered the iron with alum foil and lived off of whitebread toast & velveeta sandwiches. Then I was into the apples and peanut butter phase, grapes, cheetoes, canned tuna (straight, no chaser) and it went down hill after that. Hotels with continental breakfasts are above the self imposed budget and we're never in one spot long enough to rent kitchenette accomodations. I still cook soup in the coffee makers, but I do clean up my messes with real dishwashing liquid and green 3M pads"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Very pleased!,I purchased this mixer for my wife.  Below are her comments:
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,"Good design, BAD engineering",The fan is lovely and silent. Until you click on the top to make it oscillate. Within minutes.... click click click click.... the sound of two gears stripping instead of meshing.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Same quality as the cookware,"In fact, these cups are made in tri-ply with cast stainless handles just like the cookware.  They are much heftier than ordinary stamped stainless cups and in their way, beautiful; so should display very well if you wanted to hang them for convenience. They seem equally immune to our dishwasher and grandkids"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,These tongs are nice...,"Constructed of one piece of nylon bent into an open shape. The design prevents one half of the tong from eventually not meeting up with its counterpart (twisting or racking), or falling apart from frequen use (like metal tongs made of 2 tongs and a spring)."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Silicone bakeware ROCKS!,"Need to bake something sticky and gooey? This bakeware will make your life easier! Nothing sticks to it! And, also a wonderful thing, storage is easy because you can cram it into a smaller space due to its flexibility"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Great chopsticks for money,"I bought this after moving into a new apartment and needing household items.  While generic chopsticks are good, this set is worth the money.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great gift idea,I gave this dish to 2 friends for Christmas and got rave reviews. It's perfect for serving hot appetizer dips or for side dishes at dinner.  The color is great- vibrant but not too bright
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,great value,Quality product.  Better than you would expect for the price.  Fit and finish well above average
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Great Glasses!,"These glasses are great!  I bought them in the store, and unfortunately the first two sets I got had broken/chipped glasses.  But once I got a good set, I have been so happy with my purchase!  It totally outweighs the bad luck I had with the first two sets.  These glasses are a great size, and surprisingly durable.  They've been dropped, banged up, went through the dishwasher numerous times, and are still in great shape.  I've even bought this set as a gift for my dad!  He loves them too"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,LOVE IT. Works great. Highly recommend.,"We have had this about six months. Already own a burr grinder..but heck waking up to a fresh pot, not having to measure bean (just fill and it grinds what it wants. What is not to like?"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Rice Cooker,We had a Salton rice cooker for about 5 years and the heating element burned a hole right thru the aluminum rice pot.  In looking for a new rice cooker we had a few criteria: 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Love The Sheets,These sheets are soft and comfortable.  My only regret is that I did not but more than one set while they were on such a great sale!
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,BARGAIN HUNTERS,THIS PEELER WORKS FINE. JUST AFTER ORDERING IT FROM AMAZON I SAW IT AT WALGREENS FOR 4.99....THE EVERYDAY PRICE. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT COULD BE FOUND EVEN CHEAPER THAN 4.99 AT DISCOUNT STORES.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent machine,"This is the second portable-type carpet cleaner i've had and it's by far the best. I like the ability to turn it on, walk away and come back to a clean spot. But i probably use the manual handheld feature more often because it doesn't leave the telltale perfectly clean round patch"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,"Too Small, Too Cool, and Other Reasons to Avoid",Just used this fryer for the first time last night.  I was extremely disappointed.  My daughter and her family were coming for a casual dinner and I planned to deep fry frozen breaded shrimp.  I wanted to have the oil nice and hot when they arrived so that frying the shrimp would take only a matter of minutes.  
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,The Rabbit is a Swift Wine Opener,"This wine opener is very easy to use. You don't wrestle with the bottle screwing in the opener into the cork, the cork does not break off, and it is fast. The accessories are nice also like the bottle corker is nice for when you don't drink the whole bottle and the drip rim is also a nice way to keep the wine from dripping down the side of the bottle. A great gift for that wine lover in your life or yourself"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Good Balance, easy to sharpen, ugly as sin.",I originally bought this knife because one of the chefs at the restaurant I work at had one. I picked it up one day and the lightness and balance blew my mind. A couple weeks later I bought my own as well as a ceramic water sharpener. 
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,2.0,has no insulation,"I was disappointed in this item because it has no insulation.  For me the greater need is to keep a bottle cool thruout the meal.   This will do that OK, but then don't expect it to cool down that second bottle you had not planned on drinking.  I'm planning to keep my eye out for one of those foam covers people use on beer bottles, but in a size big enough for wine bottles"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,great peeler,"Nice handle, zippy sharp blade with enough of a gap so thick peels don't get stuck and get annoying. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Replaced my old chef's knife...,"I reserve 5-stars for items that are mind-blowing in quality. This knife has replaced my original Chef's knife in the kitchen so I would say it comes pretty close to 5-stars. It is surprisingly light and balanced, but the weight seems mainly in the grip area. It is so sharp that my wife lopped off one of her fingernail tips accidentally. She has a greater respect for it now! The santoku has just enough curve in it to rock back and forth for finely mincing garlic if needed. Since the blade is so light, an experienced wielder can perform those rapid chopping motions with ease. I would say that my skills are not good enough to utilize this knife to its full potential. :)"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Wonderfuly Flexible Steamer,From the unpacking to the eating - great experience. The 2 containers of different size alows a large choice of quantity to steam. The control panel is natural to operate and the dispaly size very comfortable. I like the feature allowing adding water during steaming. The weight of the unit is surprisingly light. I can't think of any feature that is missing.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Great Idea but weak implementation...does not save work in the long run,I have owned two of these...the first was replaced for free by Walmart where I purchased it for the same price as here.  They are complex structures and I cannot imagine anyone who is not a handy man owning one for long.  I am and I find it a very poor implementation of a good design idea.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,A Real Comfort.,"The pillow top sits fine atop the bed and raises the level about 4 inches. It's very comfortable and fluffy like a really large pillow. I am warmer as I am using it. I really just wish I had a good bed cover to give my bed a stricter apperance of form. I will most likely purchase a cover and new sheets from a department or specialty store. The baffling is just fine for my frame, it does not bother me, I am 6'2'' and my body lays differently then others, so I can not clearly comment on that issue. I imagine my belt buckle might tear the pillow so I do not lay in my bed without changing clothes to bed attire. Even after a long day/night out. My mattress is only a few years (3-3 1/2) old and I will be purchasing a new bed this next year, but until then, this pillow top is a great buy. It retails for $268.00 in some stores, for obvious high retail market reasons. I do have trouble buying anything I can test, but this pillow top is a real comfort to my bones"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,best stoneware for baking,My loving and kind boyfriend surprised me on my birthday with this Le Creuset stoneware. I used this dish for the very first time to bake lasagna. I was so impressed how the food was evenly baked.I highly recommend this product
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Best Coffee maker in the world,"There is no better coffeemaker than Farberware.  My last one stayed with me for 15 years before I replaced it.  Now that I have a new one, I love the smell and taste of fresh perked coffee once again... "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Farberware Percolator is Great,"My wife and I have used the Mr. Coffee type of drip coffeemakers for several years but have always yearned for a more robust, pure coffee flavor.  We got that with this percolator and without any sediment in the bottom of the cup.  It percolates a clear, really tasty cup of coffee.  Farberware has made a very high quality product with the FCP512S.  The cordless feature really puts it over the top along with the 2 hour automatic shutoff"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,4.0,No frills and no complaints,"The title pretty much covers it.  No spout screen to catch leaves, no fancy sure-loc lid, just a really cute, but not cutesy teapot in a stonewear material that looks like it will NOT break easily.  A hard working everyday teapot in a bunch of cheery colors - what else could you want"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Add a little time and you'll have great hard boiled eggs,"I bought this on a whim for $5, and it has been handy to have.  I add time to both the cooking time and the waiting time, and the eggs come out great.  They were a little bit undercooked at the recommended times.  I do find that the water is quite hot when I take the cooker out of the microwave, but nothing that rubber gloves can't handle with ease.  I've only made hard boiled eggs with it that are cooled before eating, but I've been happy with how this little contraption works"

kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Groovy Bed,"Bought this about a month ago as a spare bed and something to travel with. This bed is amazingly comfortable! I expected a lot less! If you travel or sleep away from home often, this is what you need! I took a recommendation to spend the extra money on Aero products and I would recommend them in return now. Stays inflated all night, is not over or under-inflated, very comfortable, seems very durable, quick and easy to deflate and pack up when done in the morning, takes almost no space when rolled up, awesome bed! That's my 2 cents"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Perfect performance,"Like all of the tools in the line, this one does it's job amazingly well. I bought four tools from this line to cover various jobs, and they all outperform anything I have ever used before. Get one or two,and you will understand"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Pizza slicer,The slicing ability and ease of use makes this a welcome addition to by kitchen utensils
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Doorstop,"On my Counter there are 3 appliances: A 50s era streamlined chrome GE Toaster, still works like the day it was new; a 70s GE Toaster Oven with fake wood grain, not as cool looking but still works perfect; and last this Krups espresso machine, it never worked right, agonizingly slow, I thought perhaps it was just my inexperience, I did all the  cleaning, descaling as advised, now after barely a year the pump makes groaning noises and nothing comes out, I'm thinking with its rubber feet and ample weight it may make a good doorstop"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,1.0,Warped after first use,I was so excited to see this in my gold box and bought it immediately. After the first use it warped rather severely. I bet the warp will hold about one half cup of water. I used it to bake a chicken at 350 degrees. I'll be calling All-Clad to see what can be done. Otherwise it's a nice shiny pan
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best peeler ever!,"I decided to get a new peeler after suffering through a horrible evening of peeling a butternut squash with an inferior peeler.  I bought the oxo peeler and it has been great.  I don't know if it has a sharper blade than most or what exactly it is about the peeler, but it makes peeling everything a breeze.  Peel potatoes and apples by staying close to the skin and peeling off long pieces of skin at a time instead of small spots, a waste of energy.  The only thing about this peeler I don't like is that the design doesn't allow for a sharp end, which would be helpfull when pulling out the ""eyes"" of potatoes"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,It lifts and separates,"The 9 by 11 1/2 inch Roasting Rack fits perfectly in the Le Creuset 7 3/4 by 14 inch rectangular baker. Its simple design lifts your roast up from the bottom of the pan separating your roast from a pool of grease. This makes the skin of the chicken crisp all over, and reduces grease laden soggy roasts. "
kitchen & housewares,8 of 18,2.0,Don't let your wife use it,"This is the second Vac-u-vin I have purchased - the last one at a winery in California. The first one worked great for a couple of months then one day, my wife was using it and it froze up. You couldn't pull it or push it - like it had gasket slip loose inside or something. You can't take them apart to see so we just bought a new one thinking it was defective. This one lasted less than 2 weeks. Worked great, the wife tried it one day and POOF, it wouldnt push or pull. I won't be buying them again (at least not with this wife)."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Can't live without this tumbler!,"Keeps hot stuff hot, cold stuff cold.  Simple - this product does what it is supposed to.  Thank you!!  My coffee stays hot until I finish it, thank you!!  The other hot and humid day here in NY, I made iced coffee in this tumbler.  Used ice cubes and did not put the top on the tumbler.  The iced coffee was made at 1 pm... it was still cold with ice cubes unmelted at 8 pm.  Thank you!!  HIGHLY recommend to all travelers and lovers of hot stuff hot, and cold stuff cold :-"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,indispensable,"I have had a Hot Shot for approximately 20 years.  I hope I never find it impossible to purchase another.  I keep a spare one in the pantry.  They are sometimes very hard to purchase.  Sunbeam direct does not sell them, so many times I have had to hunt a supplier.  I have bought it many times for friends and relatives. I use it daily for one thing or another. Love it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love them!!!,"My husband and I got two sets for our wedding, we're going on 4 years and only one of them has been broken, that was because he dropped it.  I love the fact that they are so simple, and classic but they are that beautiful blue.  I definately recommend these to anyone that likes their look"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 10-Inch Stir-Fry Pan Review,"I've purchased a few of these pans over the years. While I generally prefer cookware from Calphalon's competitor (Company A), this pan is a terrific value."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Works fine - glad I have one,"I bought a less expensive model (w/o the extra space for roll storage) but mine functions just like this one.  I have used it for about 2 months and it is working very well.  Yes, that little nozzle gizmo on the sealer requires a few extra seconds sometimes, but for the most part it doesn't give me any trouble.  Here are a few tips for successful use of ANY type of vacuum sealer:"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,How Good Does It Get?,"Hey, its a Gravy/Fat separator how good does it get? Well suprisingly its great. It is shaped so that the mouth fits the shape of the pan eliminating spills, it has its own strainer and it holds alot. Cooks Illustrated also recommended it, but was not crazy about the larger holes in the strainer, I disagree. I think smaller holes would clog it. If you want to strain it more, which I have not needed to, just put it through a finer strainer. Its as good as it gets"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Absolutely ingenious!,"I have known other fine openers for wine bottles, but this one beats them all. Whether it's cork or synthetic material, it works almost like magic. This holds for removing the cork from the opener as well. What a joy to operate this fine tool. Sorry if I sound a bit too ecxited. But practical items that come so close to to a job the perfect way really get my admiration. The only drawback: this tool is a bit bulky and thus requires more storage room than a ""screw-pull"" type. But I am amazed every time. And it looks like it is really built to last. It comes with two spare spirals too. And the foil cutter is perfect as well!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works Great!,It does exactly what it says it will do: chills your drinks quickly
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,sometimes the simple things work best,"this is a piece of plastic that is cut to fit the Kitchenaid food processor discs.  So, it holds them perfectly, on the wall or in the cabinet"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Worth your money,"I am not a water tasting pro, but the difference btwn Brita filtered water and tap water is highly noticeable.  Brita filtred water taste great for me and my 3 rooommates."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Bissell Quickstreamer Carpet Cleaner,"I was amazed at how well this worked, considering how light and inexpensive it was.  Required a lot of water changing, but that's really not a big problem.  If it had bigger tanks, it would be heavier and more difficult to handle.  I was very pleased and would recommend it for anyone who has carpeting that needs occasional cleaning"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Knives,I've had these knives since about August of this year (about 3 months)... they came straight out of the box with a great edge... very sharp. I've used them quite a bit and i couldn't be any more satisfied with these. They are definitely a great purchase
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Still going after 15 years,"Great machine for all your mixing from bread dough to whipped cream. Never a problem in the 15 years I've been using it. Recommend pouring shield.  Grinder attachment works well but the pasta plates get too warm so the pasta doesn't turn out well.  Also, if you plan on storing the mixer on your counter, measure the space.  Some cabinets are too low and the mixer won't fit under the cabinets. It's heavy so it's hard to lug around. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Citrus Squeezer,This is an excellent citrus squeezer. I got rid of my reemers after receiving this. The handles are very comfortable and it is very easy to use
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Highly recommended,"I never thought a thing about cookware and bought the cheapest stainless sets I could find. Then I bought a Calphalon pan and was just amazed at the difference. When people write about their food heating evenly, they mean it. You only have to heat to ""medium"" to have what ""high"" would be on a cheap pan. The whole bottom of the pan stays hot--even the parts that aren't directly on the eye. But using them will spoil you and it will be hard to use anything else. This fryer is a nice, big size (and remember, the whole bottom stays hot)--perfect for almost any food. I agree with the person who wrote that it was limiting for them to call it a ""chicken fryer"". You will use it for a lot more than that. Well worth the money."
kitchen & housewares,48 of 50,5.0,The blender,"This blender sets itself apart from other blenders in a couple of important ways.  Its glass is shorter and wider than other blenders, and this in combination with the shape of the blades makes it very difficult for stuff to hand about and not get blended.  Also, it is a powerhouse.  It has a fat motor and just will not let you down.  But, and this is possibly my favorite, the cord wraps up neatly in the base for clutter free storage"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Great for those that are not easily organized,"Before this, I had the traditional, plastic organizer, that I had in pantry draw, it always seemed to get disorganized.  I know keep this displayed on pantry shelve, when I have company (often buffet style).  I carry this out to the table.  Displays my flatware beautifully.  (This is not meant to be used as a dryer).  I just bought another for my twin sister as she not very organized eithe"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Oster is a better product,"As always the item was delivered in a timely manner, however it is not nearly as user friendly as the Oster Egg Cooker which was out of stock. On the plus side, the eggs do not stick to the poaching part, the cooker itself cleans up nicely."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Nice wash cloth, but beware, price is for 'one' wash cloth only!","I just ordered two of these cloths on July 21, 2006, thought I was getting 2 2-packs of the wash cloths, when the package arrived it contained just 2 single wash cloths."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,4.0,Grand Prix 2 handle not as comfortable as old Grand Prix,"I bought this knife to complement my set of Grand Prix knives because I wanted something that was mid-way between a chef's knife and a cleaver and this fit the bill.  The knife is very useful, well designed and well made (as expected of a Wusthof).  I would prefer the knife to be a little heavier as it feels somewhat lighter to me than my 8 inch Grand Prix Chef's knife.  But it cuts through meat and veggies very well without any ""clinging"" to the blade.  It also makes short work of tough fruits like melons, canteloupes, etc.  I also find the Grand Prix 2 handle not as comfortable as my Grand Prixs.  I prefer the straight-backed handle of the older model to the new humped-back ergonomic handles on the Grand Prix 2's but that is just my preference.  Otherwise, I am pleased with the knife. "
kitchen & housewares,8 of 12,1.0,Animal Cruelty,Imagine living in a hallway about three feet wide. It's no different than that for the fish for their entire lives in the frame. Please don't purchase items like this. It isn't a suitable home for even a single betta
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"Nice backup to 8""chef's knife","Now that I have the kids helping me cook dinner/chop vegetables etc. I needed another ""chef"" knife. Rather than duplicate the chef's knife, I got this one and am very pleased. It's narrower blade makes slicing easier, the curve of the blade has a nice rocker motion to it. I think of the two styles I prefer the French Chef's over this one but as a second knife this one is great"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Nonstick Surface Comes Off - Don't waste your money!,"You would think that for nearly $100, this pan would be indescructable - not so! We've had this pan for under 2 years, and first the surface lost its non-stick characteristics. Then, it started to peel off - first on the outside top edges of the pan. We NEVER used harsh cleaning products or rough sponges, yet the surface just came off! And don't think you can just contact All-Clad for a replacement under warranty - I've tried to get in touch with them twice and they've never responded back to me. Save your money and buy a cheaper pan - even if you have to buy a new one every year, you'll still make out in the end."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,I never knew what a difference it could make,"Had I known what a difference this would make with my cooking, I would have bought one a long time ago. Everything is faster, now, and everything I mix, from potatoes to icing, comes out smoother, too. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Get giant store bought-type muffins at home!,"After wanting a jumbo muffin pan for years, I finally received one as a wedding shower gift, and I love it!  You can use this pan with standard muffin recipes that make a dozen small muffins; you'll just get six large muffins instead.  With a bit longer cooking time than for smaller muffins, this muffin pan cooked my jumbo muffins to perfection:  golden brown and evenly cooked throughout.  Plus, it was completely non-stick, so getting the muffins out of the pan--even sticky blueberry-packed ones--wasn't a problem, and clean up was a breeze.  A highly recommended item"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,OXO Salad Spinner,"I have put off buying this item as I felt it was a ""fad.""  Well, how wrong can person be.  I am above retirement age and I have always struggled with keeping lettuce fresh for any period of time.  This system with washing the lettuce in cold water, spinning it in the OXO and then using the other top to make the spinner a storage unit is the best ever.  My lettuce stays crisp (sometimes crisper than originally) for as long as it takes two of us to eat a head of Romaine.  Great product"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,No bottlecap is a match for this,"This is probably the sturdiest bottle opener I've ever used. It opens pretty much any bottle with ease, and leverage is easy due to its bulk and size. You probably won't ever lose it, either, since it's so big. It's definitely not for travel because of its weight, so you'll want something else if you plan to bring a bottle opener to picnics or camping trips"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,2.0,Looks Better Than It Is,"I purchased this coffeemaker because of the stainless steel carafe. The problem is when you pour coffee into a cup, it goes all over, I have to pour off the kitchen sink. No matter how slow or fast, it makes a mess. The second problem is when the coffee sits on the warmer, it starts to boil. This may be a problem with just this one. I would not purchase this item again"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Orange Juice Lover,"Somewhat disappointing. It wastes too much juice and pulp and is not stable when pressing. Fortunately I am right-handed. Good only for occasional use on short runs of one or two, at most three, glasses, otherwise other squeezers are more appropriate. It works better with small oranges"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Wonderful!,"For years I've been fed up with lousy ice cream scoops and vowed to someday find a really good one. When I saw this one I thought, ""Wholly cow, how can someone justify spending [such an amount] on an ice cream scoop?"" Well, I bought it anyway and I do not regret it. It is wonderful; even better than I had hoped. It cuts hard ice cream like butter and is beyond sturdy; it should last generations. Negatives are that it can't go in the dishwasher and high price"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,4.0,Beautiful but flawed,"My wife and I bought 3 complete sets of this dinnerware plus all the accessories.  We really like them except for two problems.  As previously stated the dinner plate is oversized and I had to make some modifications to make them fit in our cabinets. Also, they don't fit our dishwasher very well.  We end up using the salad plates which are almost as big as a normal dinner plate.  My biggest complaint is that these dishes are NOT microwave safe.  Three minutes on high and you'd BETTER use a potholder.  Don't even think about making a cup of coffee or tea, you'll end up with a blister! If you can deal with these problems as we have, you can set a beautiful table"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Very nice shiny pan...,I also have the 1.5 Q and they are beautiful pans. Non stick pans are not suitable for all situations. I lucked out at the $10 price.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Outstanding Value,"What a bargain, this is a great thermometer and the push button power switch is so easy to use; my other one had a tiny little switch that was so hard to work"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,2.0,How is this an helpful item?,"I bought two of these, first two times using them, everything stuck to them. In both cases I was making cookies (with a lot of butter). I didn't add any additional spray/lube/butter to the mat, because I thought that was the point of using them. Theoretically cleanable in a dishwasher, but they're so floppy and large that it's impractical. I left them soak in the sink and the dough did come right off after a few minutes of soaking. But... how is this better than a regular cookie sheet? I can put that in the dishwasher. A cooking salesperson today told me she had the silpat (or similar) and they worked great. I told her mine stuck and she said, ""Oh, you must have the Kitchenaid ones."""

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,The best food processor ever!,"Kitchenaid does it again!  My husband bought this wonderful food processor for me for, well, just because and I love it. It chops foods so quickly that you seldom need to do anything more than pulsate. Because the motor is so powerful, you can add more to chop and it gets it done without the few chunks that were always left over with my old food processor.  The 4-cup Mini Bowl makes it perfect for choping onions, garlic or anything that you only need a little of.  I highly recommend this to anyone serious about cooking, always taking your time when washing and drying the blades as they are truly extra, extra sharp"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Product,I have been using one for 15 years.  Holds 7 of 8 heads.  I love the large capacity. Saves energy by avoiding multiple roastings. It is tough and  roasts evenly. The glazed base makes for easy cleaning.
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,poor battery-expensive to replace,"We have had the shark for 6-12 months when the battery died.  The replacement was $25.00 to include shipping.  The new one didn't work.  When I called to check on the replacement battery I was told I should have had a professional install it.  Great product when it works, poor customer service and parts are expensive"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 19,1.0,Lodge Pro-Logic Pan,"This product did not live up to its description in terms of being pre-seasoned and therefore almost non-stick.  I only used it twice.  Both times the food stuck to the pan and was quite a chore to clean up, especially when detergent or other cleaners were not to be used on it.  I would not buy any of their similar products based on this experience"

But when it came in, there were 2 things that surprised me - Like another reviewer had mentioned, this came with a sticker saying ""Thanks for buying $300 worth Analon Products"". The same sticker was also stuck to the pot. Also the pacaking was damaged(the packaging was torn, and the shipment was not even taped right) I have been buying things with amazon for a really long time and I this is my first bad experience. "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,An Asset To Those Who Love To Cook!,"I love Pyrex products anyway, so when we received this set as one of our wedding gifts over two years ago it truly was a godsend! I love it, and so does my husband! The bowls are perfect sizes for all of your needs. The smaller bowls are just right for leftovers and one-serving-meals. The lids hold up in the microwave as well as clean up in the dishwasher -- especially after spaghetti sauce has been in it! Much better than that plasticeware sold at the grocers.  The idea of a steam release lid is wonderful. Holds up well in the microwave.  No mishaped lids.  Cleans up nicely after being in the dishwasher. The steam release lid is great.  Although you do need to be careful pulling the lid the rest of way off because not ALL of the steam goes out. It's just common sense. It just came out of a microwave ... of course it's going to be hot and steaming! They also keep your food nice and hot for a good period of time. Bravo to Pyrex"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Quite Pleased With This Blender,"I recieved this a few days ago and yesterday I used it for the first time. I put in some vanilla ice cream, some milk, some ice and a couple good sized spoons of peanut butter. This blender worked great and made a very delicious and tasty peanut butter milkshake with no fuss at all. I had wondered if I would have to turn it on and off and keep checking to see if the ice was fully crushed like the older model I had but this really did the trick! I also love the feature of the spout where you just press and it comes right out. Im sure I will be using this often"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Sturdy, easy to inflate and deflate, pretty comfy","I easily inflated the Aerobed when I received it. I like how you can just plug the inflater into the wall. My old one required big heavy batteries. The pillow that inflates is a good height - I had worried that it would be too high.  It inflates into a real sized tall bed! And doesn't topple over because there are two inflated support tubes on the bottom of each side. I haven't slept on it yet, but I did recline on it, and it was very comfortable. I certainly recommend it."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Repeat Buyer,"We have been using the same, Revere 3 1/2 quart Copper Bottom Teakettles for the past fifty years.  The recent purchase, the fourth one, was purchased to set up housekeeping in at a summer camp in Massachusetts.  It was the first thing that we bought after four folding chairs!"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 13,5.0,Pyrex Prepware Cobalt 3-piece mixing bowl set,This is a cobalt blue Pyrex translucent mixing bowl set with a lip around the rims.  The color matches my kitchen decor and I'm very pleased with it
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good juicer.,My wife has been using this for about 3 months and it's working great.  
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Deal and Well Worth it .,Wow what a great price and comfortable.Yes they pile after washing but hey their cotton and I also expected it .They are soft not rough feeling compared to some sets I paid alot more for.I own 2 sets now and plan to continue to save money and order more for the rest of my family.
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Not Worth The Money,"I purchased this can opener on July 3, 2006. I wish I had waited and been able to read Wilson's comment that was posted July 23. At first the thing worked great...for about 4 weeks! Soon thereafter it would nolonger hug the can, then the handle broke. I would send it back, but it's not worth the return shipping. I've tossed it into the trash instead!"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,Excellent grater,I've purchased this and other Cuisipro graters and really appreciate the quality and sharpness of their blades. I've given these graters as gifts for friends and family and everyone loves them. I use this flat grater for parmesan and citrus zests and have used it recently for ginger. This is an essential tool in my kitchen
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,easy to use and easy on the eyes,This hip juicer works amazingly fast. We have been on a lemon martini craze lately and it makes it so much easier than the old plastic juicer. Easy to clean- easy to use. I highly reccommend it!!!!! Plus looks great on your kitchen counter
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Farberware Fabulous Electric Perk,This is such a wonderful product.  We can actually have a hot cup of coffee.  I was serving a cup to a dear friend and she made so much of it that I had to give it to her.  Now I need to buy another for myself.  Great product for making those two to four cups of coffee when you are retired.  You cannot believe how fast the coffee is done
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,did not do what I wanted it to do,"I purchased this timer to time an exercise program--the alarm is so faint that I cannot hear it even from 3 feet away - otherwise, it is fine--I just cannot use it and it was too expensive to return such an inexpensive ite"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Quality @ Great Price,"I'm a guy, 47 professional ... and cook well ... so I want quality tools in my kitchen, same as I want in my horse barn, or work shop, and I hate poor quality things that don't work well."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Love it,This is a wonderful machine.  I have owned 2 other mixers in my married life but this is the best.  It's quiet & gets the job done
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great addition to the Four Star collection,Purchased this knife to complete my knife collection.  I'm not a serious (or even a great) cook but I love Henckels Four Star knives and have used them for over 20 years.  This knife (as well as the others in the Four Star Collection) is well balanced and very sharp.  It makes me want to take cooking lessons so my meager skills can match the knife's potential.  My efforts in the kitchen may not taste gourmet but I feel like a chef with this knife in my hand.  Maria
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,excellent quality and performance..,"I have owned many knives over the years, and decided to upgrade to a solid forged set a while back. After much deliberation, I decided on the Wusthofs. From the moment you pick up the chef's knife in your hand, you can sense the heft and know that using it will be enjoyable. They are like a precision race car, in the sense that you have unbelievable control over the blade thanks to their incredible balance. I find myself using the bread knife, the chefs knife, and the paring knife the most, and could do without the sandwich knife, as it is the same blade as the utility and the carving, just in between. The utility can do everything the  sandwich can, and is only marginally larger. I would much rather have a trimming knife or boning knife instead. I now look forward to chopping vegetables and enjoy carving roasts because I am able to exert such control over these knives.      For those who may have owned cutco over the years, and think they are the greatest knives ever, I laugh at myself when I think about how much i paid for them. They are stamped steel, and are incomparable to Wusthof, Henckels, Global, Kershaw, etc. I prefer the feel of Wusthof to others, yet they are all amazing knives. Head to a local store that carries high end cutlery and choose a set that feels right in your hand."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Onion Chopper,"Unit works just fine for what it was designed to do. It chops onions. Not much else, except perhaps apples."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Someday a Collectible,"   Le Creuset has a good reputation,and no wonder."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This is good,"I like this product as one of my friend recommended it to me.  I like the design the quality and the product.  When it accidentally got slipped on the ground, it was still fine, no cracks."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Love my FryDaddy,"I should have bought this years ago. Yeah, it splatters some, but so does using a frying pan. I find that if I put frozen foods (french fries, etc.) in a collander and rinse the ice crystals off with hot water a few minutes before I put them in the hot oil, they don't splatter as much."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,No fingerprints!,"This bread box is the 3rd one I have purchased in 5 years.  The first 2 were hard to keep clean and were oversized in height.  When you have a lot of bread to store, there is always toast on the menu.  Where there is toast, there is butter.  This low-profile brushed chrome box holds 2 full sized loaves of bread and leaves NO FINGERPRINTS like some of the stainless steel or glass front boxes.  I also found this to be the most aesthetically appealing bread box since it coordinated with my toaster and coffee maker.  So far, my bread likes its new home"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,good for my needs,"this vacuum is great for my apartment because it's mostly one big room loft.  it get's the job done.  though i haven't been able to get it to work on its schedule.  i set the scheduler remote, but it won't send the info to the robot, so it's pointless.  i just start the vacuum when i'm leaving the apartment. keep cords and things off the floor or it will get stuck and don't be surprised if it doesn't always make it back to its home base"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 16,2.0,"Handles not comfortable, high price","I shopped between the Tri-Ply and the Simply Calphalon Stainless product lines... tried them out in a local store.  I recommend the Simply Calphalon set which has a much more comfortable handle.  The Tri-Ply is quite a bit heavier; the handles are very uncomfortable with the Tri-Ply especially with the additional weight, even when empty;  it might have slightly better heat distribution than the Simply line, however the Simply line does have pretty good heat distribution; the Tri-Ply is quite a bit more expensive."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Nice Design!!,This is very lovely set! Especially the bowls!! They come with a nice delicate row of flowers design outside the bowls which you normally don't found in other corelle sets!! I am still looking for matching platter and large serving bowl!! Unforunately Amazon doesn't carry them!! You can get same set of 48 pieces in Walmart as well!!. Also try the bake-serve set available on amazon which matches this one
kitchen & housewares,2 of 42,5.0,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i'm making this review for my old teacher. it is yellow. CASE CLOSED THANKS!!!!!!!!!!
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Makes Cookies Fast!,"I bought this to make cookies, and also for when I make matzoh balls, and it is alittle too large for that, so I also bought the medium sized one.  Both work the same, and both work very well, and really do cut down on your time.  I also like to make things like cookies in uniform size, and this does that.  I have very small hands, but I had no problem using this, and it did not hurt my hands, at all"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,excellent,"I bought this based on reviews here.  I bought it for use in a commerical environment, as I was worried about people getting cut on sharp edges caused by the existing can opener. This OXO one works like a charm, and everyone thinks it's such a cool gadget. "
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,"defective, poorly manufactured machine","Our machine worked well for the first week, but after that began to demonstrate the same problems others described.  And yes, we did read the instructions.  The lid appears to be poorly designed so that overflow is inevitable on some machines.  Also, the button you  press to open the valve for pouring was broken from the start.  A very expensive piece of junk. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Great pan!,This sturdy pan is great for heating up soups and I also use it to stir fry veggies. The nonstick coating works well and I haven't seen any scratches yet. Heats up quickly and evenly. Just make sure you use wood or nylon utensils and keep it medium heat or lower.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Not satisfied at all,I use a fine grind to make coffee with. The fine setting of this grinder wasn't close to the fine grind that I get from the grinders at my local supermarket. I have a Krups 203B which does a much better job even if I have to guestimate when it is done. I am not satisfied at all with this product and consider it a waste of money
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,2.0,Save your money.,"My white KitchenAid coffee maker was looking nasty and old so instead of waiting for the new model, I bought this Cuisinart. I used it for four days. It's now in the garage.  It absolutely drove me nuts. The lid for pouring in the water doesn't open far enough to clear the carafe so I ended up spilling half the water. And the basket thingie won't close if the basket is off a millimeter.  And besides, I don't think the coffee was all that great for $70.  So now I'm back to my 4-Cup blue KitchenAid and saving my dough for another big KitchenAid"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,As always  THE BEST !!!,"I have the long handled and a short handled  and am  about to purchase another one. As always Kitchen Aid has made another great product! They do not deteriorate like the cheaper products, are able to withstand high temps, keep their color"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Thrilled,"I can't believe that I finally found just what I was looking for!  I also bought the rest of the pieces and I couldn't be happier with the quality and the looks of them.  They make a beautiful table setting, casual and yet elegant.  You can mix them with other square pieces you have in any color and they look great.  I wish they came with a completer set, I would buy them in a minute"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 38,5.0,My recent order,"Although I have not used the DrinkMaster as yet, I am sure that it will work fine.  It looks like brand new, and just from the looks of it, I am certain that I made the correct joice."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,So far so good,"So far so good with this blender. My only gripe is that is doesn't seem to crush all the ice. There's always a little piece left in the bottom. I jiggle the container, turn up the speed then back down but that ice sliver won't blend."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Make your own coffee pod......,The product is very innovative and useful.  I have often used it to brew tea in my Senseo.  It should be included as a standard part of the Sensea coffee brewer.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent fan and cool looking to boot!,"We're very happy with the VF20 in my house:  #1 It's a great fan really moving a lot of air even at the lower settings.  #2 It's got great 40's styling and is very solid, not like the typical break-after-one-season types I typically find at local stores"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Makes nice taco shells for taco salads,"The taco shells come out nice and crispy and the cinnamon/sugar recipe suggested on the box is delicious.  I wish it had come in a 4-pack set instead of only two, though...gets expensive having to order two sets.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price which I found a bit excessive considering this is only a pressed metal form that can literally be stamped out for a dime a dozen at the manufactoring plant where they are made"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good gravy!,"Well, I never thought I'd own a gravy boat, but here I am! Owning a gravy boat. As gravy boats go, it just sits in the cupboard and takes up space unless it's Thanksgiving or Christmas or I feel like cooking a turkey (Ha!). But it's very nice, easy to hold even when it's filled with hot gravy, and it holds a lot. Much easier to clean than any of those fancy metal ones"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,The previous reviewer's facts are correct,"And it's cheap, & it's perfect for me; why would I want to spend a bunch of money for an electric one that would wear out?  My Amazon-bought Zojirushi electric rice cooker is worth it - there's more to cooking rice than boiling an egg.  You gotta find a pot with 9"" inside diameter and a lid. I use an old spaghetti pot. No more bland boiled eggs -- add vinegar, butter, sauces while the egg poaches"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Durable and Beautiful,I bought this set about 7 months ago and use it everyday. The quality is excellent. We don't have a dishwasher here and the dishes get jammed around a lot in the cupboard and sink and NO CHIPS so far--even tho' I've cringed when they've been banged together a few times. We use these in the microwave too--no problems. The color is beautiful and all the same. No fading or difference between each piece. I also have the teapot set--that came separately and the color of the set exactly matches the dishes! If your a fan of lovely tableware and want great quality-this set is it. I have received many compliments on this  beautiful set
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,awesome,"Simply the safest, simplest, step ladder for use around the inside of the house...I love this stool.!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Leaks like a kid with a runny nose!,"I purchased the All Terrain after much research. I read reviews about the previous model in which several users had issues with broken and leaking clean water tanks. Since this was a new model, I had hoped -- a wrongly bet -- that Hoover would have addressed such issues. I even found an email posted by a Hoover representative assuring that ""yes, the All Terrain will have a new tank""."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Near Flawless,"I've been using this model for a little over a year and it is by far the sturdiest and easiest of the lever wine openers I've tried.  Cheaper models tend to break, especially when used incorrectly but this one can take a licking and keep on pulling. No problems with wax corks either.  Still, I recommend you understand the instructions before trying to use any lever wine opener."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,fantastic,"Fiestaware items are objects of beauty that I have found to be virtually indestructible.  I have them at my house, and I worked for an upscale wine bar and restaurant that used them for everything...any pretty plate that survives heavy restaurant use is great in my book!  And what fantastic colors for food presentation.."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,5.0,Great Game Center for Children,"I purchased this gaming/entertainment center for my son when he was only 3.  He has a 13"" TV/VCR and an original Nintendo system with lots of games.  I thought this item would be a great addition to his room because it is sturdy plastic, easy to put together or move, and holds everything I needed it to.  This item is not something an adult would want to have in his/her living area, like one of the reviews I read.  I mean Step2 is a company that makes a lot of products for kids.  Anyway, my son loves this product, and so does his 2 year old brother"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 7,1.0,"Disappointed, very poor performance, wonder how these others are happy with it...","I bought this blender because I liked its retro design, and I thought it would function well.  Well, every single time I've tried to use it has been a disaster.  Even for very simple tasks, like blending soft avocado, the blender has not worked. The blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything... It's horrible.  And I even threw away my old, ugly blender when I bought this one... and the other worked just fine. : "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,Bad Description,"If you are truly looking for a loaf dish that is 9 X 5, do not order this one!! I did, and I am so disappointed at Amazon for describing this as such. The measurements are actually 8.5 X 4.5!! I know Pyrex has made a 9 X 5 dish, and I was hoping this was it. Oh well, live and learn. But I will say that the $3.99 price is a good deal for an 8.5 X 4.5 dish - cheaper than Walmart."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Five stars!,"I highly recommend this set. I love the mixing bowls and the 4 smaller bowls I have used for dips for parties, it's a perfect size! I only use Pyrex measuring cups, so this one is perfect. I also love the pie pan and the covers that come with the set. It really is a nice addition to any kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,Self propelled problems,"I have the U6433-900 which I believe is the same basic model as this.  It works good for me for the most part.  I have no suction problems or anything.  I bought it 2.5 years ago maybe and the cable connector broke for the self propelled feature.  I self diagnosed this problem, I could see that there is a cable when I fold the handle back and it is held on by a black PLASTIC doo-hickie that is broken... I don't even want to know how much it is going to cost for a new black plastic doo-hickie when the machine will have to be taken apart for repairing."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Pretty and well-designed, but watch for additional shipping charge","This is a nice quality set for the price.  The color is pretty (sorta like celadon with a bluish tinge), the weight is good (not too heavy, not too light), the cups are nice-sized, and the bowls are the perfect size for cereal (not too shallow, not too small).  But note: they add on an additional $5 shipping charge without notifying you first, IN ADDITION to the shipping charges listed above"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,"Good price, good construction","Searched around for a reasonably priced set of mini-springforms and this was a good price for a set of four. Good construction and a slightly large size for a single person. But it is only 1 inch high, a regular slice would be 2 or 2 1/2. It could easily be shared. Have no plans to use the stencils--really just wanted the springforms. When I make a cheescake if the batter runs a bit large (often depending upon how well I whip and fold the egg whites) I'll use the extra batter in these guys"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Great Review and Long lasting,When the person got the flowers she really liked them. She talked and talked about them. She also was suprised in a good way how long the flowers lasted (roses). I ordered flowers from them for Mother's Day because of my experince. Great job
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Hot coffee all day,"I can make coffee at 7AM, have a cup at 9, one mid-afternoon, and  by 7PM it's still too hot to drink straight out of the bottle.  I've never tried anything cold, but I'm sure the results would be comparable.  I've made morning coffee, filled the thermos, and forgot it at home while I went to work.  The next morning out of necessity I had a cup.  Still plenty warm to drink when there's nothing else."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Big improvement over the round containers,"I initially purchased these because I thought they would fit better in the refrigerator since they were not round, which they do.   I also appreciate the fact that you have to turn a dial to release the vacuum so that it cannot happen by accident.  However, because the dial is not recessed, the containers do not stack well on top of each other without using something as a shim between them.  I wad up a clean kitchen towel into a snake and place it on the top of the lid before placing another container on top of it.  This method seems to work fine for holding things in place."
kitchen & housewares,16 of 18,1.0,Not good for brown rice!,"Browse through the reviews, and you will see i am not the only person with this problem. I failed to look at the bad reviews before purchasing this unit. I am now returning it to Amazon."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Bodum Pavina double wall thermo,The Bodum Pavina double wall thermo glasses are beautiful. We got the nine ounce size to use primarily for hot tea and we really enjoy them. It's nice to be able to see the tea (floating) in the inner glass. It adds to the enjoyment. True they are no doubt more fragile than the typical glass but with some care I think they will hold up quite well. Defintely recommend them
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,great for making sauce or pie,"I had mine for 20 years and it recently broke. But heck, that's pretty good lifetime for this sort of gadget. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,What a pan!!,"I ordered this pan with my family of 5 in mind!!  To go from stove to oven is great!!  I did burn cheese in it, and it came off in a whole piece!!  No more scrubbing burnt or caked on foods anymore.  I love this pan so much I ordered the 3 1/2 quart also"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,1.0,Problem Probe,"Very limited use of this product before it failed.  Used on grill last and probe failed.  ""high"" Temp reading and will not reset.  Would not suggest you using or buying this product.  Might be a great timer though!"

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Absolutely the best I've ever owned,"Most of the reviews on this mixer seem to be more about the seller than the machine, mine is on the mixer."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Saucepan at Super Price ,"I purchased both the Cuisinart Hard-Anodized 1-1/2 quart and 2 quart saucepans and am very impressed with the build quality, performance, styling, looks, and value.  I have used both several times and find that they distribute heat evenly and work very well on low to medium electric stove burner settings. Clean-up is a snap; hot soapy water makes these saucepans look like they came right from the box.  The handles do not get too hot and the non-stick interior shows no sign of deterioration. The glass lids -- nice feature -- fit just right, however, their handles do get hot so a hotpad is a must.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Beautiful,"i love the sleek and streamlined design, and the stainless steel handles are so pretty.  this is my first knife set.  you definitely have to handwash, but they're worth the trouble.  i've used them for 2-3 wks and haven't sharpened the chef's knife yet, but i think it's time.."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,Delightful to bring to the table,This beautiful casserole is great for cooking the side veg for dinner and it comes to the table (perhaps with soup) and is very attractive. It also is nice for oatmeal in the morning.
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,5.0,If you love rice get this gadget........,"Rice has always been something I liked, white rice that is.  Now that I'm on southbeach diet white rice is out but brown and wild rice is in for phase two and three.  If you've ever tried to cook wild rice from scratch you know it takes a loooooonnnnggg time to cook properly.  I like a mix of rices with the wild rice so what I do is put the wild in here first cook it for a half hour then put the brown rice in the same pot with it, add more water (one to one according to book directions but note that one mark in the cooker is more like a cup and a half in the measuring cup) and cook for the full 45 minutes recommended for the brown rice, I've made several batches this way always comes out great.  I like a splash of olive oil and salt in with mine too, makes it taste even better.  I love this cooker, rice on the stove or in the microwave cookers can be a little hit and miss sometimes, this toy is worth the sixteen bucks and comes with a veggie steamer basket too...don't know if I'll ever use it but it's nice to know it's there"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 16,1.0,don't be fooled by the price or previous reviews,I ordered this toaster based on a combination of previous reviews and price. After more than a week of frustration I discovered the only 4-slice toasters which received good reviews cost a great deal of money (Dualit) or were backordered for weeks.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,"Underpowered, leaves sharp edge on can, slow","I was expecting a device that cut the roll-seam of the lid, but this one cuts the can just below the lid.  The resulting edge, while not razor sharp, is hazardous--in point of fact, the instructions warn, ""Note: The cut edge of the can may be sharp and shoud be treated with care."" contradicting the prominent ""NO SHARP EDGES"" claim on the packaging."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 18,5.0,A Dream Skillet,"The Creuset Skillet Grill with a press exceeded my expectations.  Frankly, I wasn't planning to use it as a hot sandwich maker, but as a grill for steaks and chicken, and it worked out wonderfully.  It's somewhat pricey, but so are all the Le Creuset products.  Hopefully, it will serve for a long time"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Terrible,"I was very disappointed,  The coffee had a burnt taste. The machine always shut off before it brewed a full cup. It fell apart after six months."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,A low quality peel,The peel warped and broke after I hand washed it for the very first time. I had just taken it out of the box and had not even used it. The wood appeared soft as other reviewers had noticed
kitchen & housewares,31 of 38,4.0,Great...but expensive,"Just a clue in here, this is a great product... but you can get the exact same thing, but at a cheaper price.  The Mirro Non Stick Double Burner Griddle is actually the same thing, with a little bigger grease runnoff area"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Doodie Pans,"What's there to say, these doodie pans fit in the electric self scooping cat boxes that I bought.  They're too expensive, but that's what I get for wanting house cats with no doodie smell.  Sure I could emply the cat boxes five times a day by hand, but someone's got to work to buy all of the cat food right"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"very ""European""","This dinner set reminds me of the colors of the pottery I saw in the hills of Italy - beautiful and vibrant colors setting an abundant, country casual table - the quality is Pfaltzgraff - excellent as always - the feeling is Viva Italia!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,"A crowd pleaser, but it needs an On/Off switch","This product produces a good cup of coffee and keeps it warm (not burnt) for hours.  My only concern is that there is no On/Off switch.  That means that you have to make sure to fill the water and add the coffee grounds and close the top before plugging it in.  Not a big deal, though.  Great product for the cost"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,design slightly changed from photos,"I ordered this in April 2006 because I've been looking for an all-metal unit. Based on the photos and description supplied by Amazon, I thought I'd take a chance."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,good wok,"I've been desperately looking for a durable, non-stick wok and never found one satisfying my need until this. I tried various brands such as Circulon(sp?) and Analon. Circulon is good but not very durable because residues are easily trapped in the grooves and not get cleaned, therefore the Teflon layer would peel off over years. And Analon is not really non-stick. So far this Calphalon works well for me; I don't know how long it can last though. The only cons are the heavy weight and the bottom are too narrow.It'd be better if they can reshape it to have wider bottom and offer a 13""-er"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,great bargain!,"This set is remarkable for the money.  cups AND saucers rather than just mugs, and the quality of the fiesta label indicates how beautifully made the dishes are.  and--cheaper at amazon than macy's"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love this ice cream spade,"My husband was skeptical when I bought this tool - how could it possibly be better than a regular ice cream scoop? This handy tool changed his mind. Now we both use the spade every time we get ice cream. The spade is especially useful for getting ice cream out of the edge of the carton, and hard ice cream isn't a challenge any more."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Shapen the blades and it will work fine,"I bought one of these the first time I saw it because my wife and I had such a good service from or KA Stand Mixer for many years. It looked so well built and sturdy. The noise level was so low, easy to clean, we liked it very much until we tried to make a banana smoothie, the result was banana chunks even after long periods of pulse or different speeds. I called KA service and the lady suggested to try riper bananas or even to puree the banana first in the KA food processor!"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,Aesthetically pleasing,this product is awesome!  it works great and it goes great with all my kitchen supplies. the stainless steel is smooth and easy to grip and it is a great conversation starter. it is very new age looking and compliments rod iron greatly. this is a wonderful product. it should be in your kitchen
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Does what it's supposed to do and looks good doing it.,"I bought this oven primarily for toast and light baking (potatos, frozen entres, etc.) but it has been deceptively versatile once you catch on to it's capabilities.  Just about anything that can be baked or gratineed in a full size oven can be handled in smaller serving sizes in the Sanyo Convection Oven."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Wonderful set, but cup handles not large enough...","I ordered two sets, one in green and one is white, because I like the mixed and matched look.  The cups are large, but the handles are very small even for small hands.  The rest of the set is great...very sturdy and large.    "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,It works great,"    This is my first coffee press and I am very pleased with the coffee I can brew with it.  It is well worth the price and the quality is very good. Your results will be good as long as you follow the directions and use coarse ground coffee. It is rated as a 4-cup unit with 6 oz. cups, but with the coffee mugs we use here in the midwest it is only a 2 cup unit. So, if you really want a 4 cup unit get the 8 cup press. If you want to try a press for coffee this is an excellent way to begin"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Senseo Extra Large Water Tank - Great,We have purchased several Senseo Pod Coffee Machines and they all came with the small water tank except for one which came with the extra large water tank.  The convenience of not having to refill the tank so often is worth spending the extra $$ to purchase the extra large tank. We have now replaced the tank on all our other machines with the extra large tank.

kitchen & housewares,10 of 27,2.0,Results OK,"I live in Brooklyn, and artisinal breads could not be hotter now.  I do all of my cooking from scratch, including hand rolling pastas, whipping cream with a wisk, etc.  I thought this clay would make up for my non ""professional"" oven.  You can make better baguettes (which I thought was French Bread) by turning your oven up to 500 degrees with a metal pan in the bottom and letting it get hot.  Then mold dough into shape and score dough to put on rack over heated pan.  Fill this pan with hot water and mist the sides of your oven, every two minutes for ten minutes.  Take water pan out and reduce temperature to 400 for 15-25 minutes depending on preference/altitude etc.  This pan makes the final rise easy, and the bread is decent; but you won't be wearing a barret and whistling ""Gigi"" since the result is a crispy bread which looks more like something from a California kitchen"

They were right. It is. "

kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,THE BEST EVER FOR RV'S,We travel in a RV 6-7 months a year.  Both of us love to cook.  This is one of my most valuable items.  I can blacken fish or slow cook a roast.  No hot spots like other electric pans. Perfectly even heat.  The non-stick surface does not have a mark on it.  I can use it on the picnic table in hot weather. Temperature controls are accurate.   I LOVE IT.  
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,it works...just not so well,The holes in this grater are set too far apart and make it very difficult to grate something as simple as a carrot.  It gets the job done...eventually but it's definately not easy.  No real complaints for the cheese grating quality though...it seems to work ok for that area
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Looks good Feels bad,"It is a great looking set. My grandson loves it, however, he slept over last night, first time since I bought it, and he would not sleep on the sheets. He said they were stiff and scratchy. He wasn't to happy with the feel of the comforter either. I had washed both and used Downey...and I will try again. If this does not help, then I am out $50+ because he cannot sleep on them. I will look for a new set, but this itme I will buy from a store...so I can feel the fabric. WHY would a company make such a nice product out of inferior material?? "

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Pleasantly surprised,"I purchased this set more than a year ago, without reading any reviews on it. When I came back to purchase a second set, I was amazed by all the negative feedback on this item. My set looks as new as the day I bought it, in spite of heavy use and abuse by two teenagers and repeated washing. Well.. the fact that I returned to purchase a second set says a lot, I think"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great product at an excellent price!,"Found this on amazon when they had one of their sales and it has been a great product, the non stick surface is excellent. I have used it over ten times in the past few months and it has stood up to the challenge. It doesn't have any fancy buttons and alarms and the like but delivers a great waffle every time. for less than 20 bucks I doubht you can find anything better"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Great - when the unit still works,"I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,"Amazon, 5 stars; Elite Home, 0","This order was for four standard pillowcases (2 pkgs of 2 each) made by somebody called Elite Home, but which Amazon sent free of charge. Some time before, I had ordered and received a king-size flat sheet, king-size fitted, and four stdrd cases, at a sale price. After three washings, the stitching in the pillow cases began unravelling. I contacted Amazon -- not to have Amazon correct the problem, but to give me contact information for Elite Home.  The first customer service rep could find NOTHING on file about Elite Home, causing me to send an E-mail to Amazon about why Amazon doesn't have on file contact information with a supplier whose goods Amazon sells.  I received back from Amazon an address and phone number for Elite Home -- right here in my hometown of Cincinnati.  But when I called the number, it had been disconnected; when I checked telephone Information (411), they gave me the same number and address.  I E-mailed all that to Amazon; in response, I received an E-mail saying Amazon was going to check into Elite Home, and telling me Amazon was sending me the four free pillowcases because of my troubles.  That is this order. After 1 washing, the stitching started to unravel.  I called Amazon -- not to complain, but to advise Amazon that Elite Home may supply inferior merchandise.  I note, however, that Amazon still carries the label."
kitchen & housewares,40 of 40,5.0,These things rock,"The previous reviewer seemed to have mistaken a baking mat - replaces parchment paper or grease on a baking sheet - with a baking sheet.  What it does is provide a surface to which almost no baked products adhere.  Why you'd do a roast or pizza on top of it is beyond me.  I've used it for cookies, various candied desserts, and a number of things where you'd otherwise have to line or grease the baking pan.  In each case it performed superbly.  It's also incredibly easy to clean (unless, apparently, you do something ridiculous like puncture it)"

Brews great coffee and having the clock and time on TOP is a major plus if you are someone who sometimes overflows the pot. ( the older I get the more I do this ha ha) It is also quiet which is nice. No moaning, groaning, or spitting with this coffemaker.  Enjoy"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Chef's Pan is Great!,"I like this pan and find that I use it more than I thought.  When you first start out using it, things sometimes stick if there isn't enough liquid added.  But as the pan seasons, that problem goes away.  Clean it well after each use, preferably by hand.  This 3 quart size is a convenient size to use for a family of six.  Happy to add it to my set"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,"Osterizer 4125 6 Piece Kitchen Center, Chrome",I purchased this for my brother in Nevada who currently has not been able to eat solid food for some time now. I felt nutritionally that he was deprived due to his status and that this blender/food processor would allow him to eat balanced meals at a consistency he could tolerate.  So far it has and he is experimenting more and more with it and states he is enjoying the ability to eat more variety and normal.

I avoided spending the money on this product for a long time and when it was in my gold box I could not pass it up! Everything I bakeg on it was better, and I was a great baker to start with! This is a great product for a work space if rolling out dough too!"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Buyer Beware,"Anyone needing assistance to open jars. need not waste their money on the oxo. The jars do not stay secure and slip, from the simplest relish jar to a large mayonaisse jar. In short, it is worse than useless - unless you need a pooper-scooper when you walk your dog. It does do that fairly well"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Top pick,"I had the fortune to tune in the KitchenAid online forum last week where the authors of the Mixer Bible were the panelists. It was so informative. It was great to hear that we share the same favorite attachment, the pasta roller. I honestly don't know how I got along without it for so many years. It really is easy enough to make fresh pasta on a Tuesday night, just like they said. Thank you, thank you, thank you for writing such a great book that spells out how to use all the attachments. I will definitely try to get the more of them in the near future as they will make cooking fun and fast. In the meantime, I'm working my way through all the pasta recipes in The Mixer Bible and none have disappointed so far"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Sharp Buy!,"I know my way around the kitchen & demand a lot from my tools. If you can get these on sale, then just do it.  They are sturdy, ez to separate & clean (just by opening the blades all the way-dishwasher safe) and they feel good in the hand AND in the handling. I know about the ""demande de le chef"" shears out there, but these are strong, reliable, handy and cut a rose stem cleanly. Great buy at $20 and lives up to Wusthof quality and simplicity."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"heavy, as expected.  Has flanges to cover lid well.","As far as I know (I have the 8"" and 10"" equivalents of this lid as well), this lid is the only one that has little flanges (?) that cover the spout portion of the corresponding skillet.  So less steam will escape.  If you want some steam to escape, just rotate it on the pan so that the spout is uncovered.  Also, this is the only lid in which it will be dust/flies free, as there is no resulting hole."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 16,2.0,"Sorry, don't like it","Yes, the stainless steel is good, it performs well, but the pan is awful to use. It has no pouring lip for sauces so they slosh everywhere, and what's with that ghastly handle?  I am very strong, yet I find the pan very heavy to carry when full.  The handle is uncomfortable and very long (to keep it less hot), which makes it awkward on the stove and to hold.  I do use a potholder. I have been able to get other brands which have far better handles (Fissler, Spring) and perform as well or better.  I find I use these before my All-Clad.  All-Clad has the market in the US, but there are better pans out there.  Shop around"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Brew 'n Go is a Keeper,"This coffeemaker is the perfect size for travel.  It saved us on a 7 day cruise we just took.  We knew the coffee onboard would be terrible and my husband HAS to have his coffee in the morning.  The coffee brewed quickly and we even used it to make hot water for tea.  My husband uses ""to-go"" styrofoam cups with lids instead of the travel mug that comes with the coffeemaker to avoid that ""plastic"" taste that might occur with hot coffee going into the mug.  You don't have to use the travel cup to brew the coffee.  My suggestions to B&D:  supply #1 filters with the coffeemaker to use in conjunction with the mesh filter already provided.  It ensures a better tasting cup of coffee. Include a carry case with the coffee maker.  We found a really inexpensive nylon Protege padded carry case at Walmart that we used. The coffeemaker fits in it perfectly and even has room for a container of coffee and a box of filters.  If you don't use the travel mug at all when brewing coffee, you have even more room in the carry case.  I would recommend this coffeemaker to anyone who travels extensively and wants the luxury of their own coffee while on the road or on vacation"

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Love it!,"I purchased the 5.5 qt. LeCreuset oven after recommendations from Cooking Light, Cooks Illustrated and reading others' reviews.  I only wish that I would have purchased this great product sooner! I have been inspired to cook more and try new recipes.

kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,EVERYTHING  AND MORE............,"This is my Third Foodsaver unit. First one was purchased over 15 years ago, and it still works. I gave it to my daughter when I bought my Foodsaver Professional II model. Through my own fault ( NOT THE MACHINES ) I managed to damage the strip of tape covering the heating element. Well, now it burns holes in the middle of the bags, and I lose the vacuum. Talia doesnt repair or replace the tape ( no one repairs anything anymore...silly me), but Talia offered to send me a refurbished Pro II for $50.00, and I didnt have to mail in my old one.....well.....before I called Talia, I bought their new Professional III unit. Anyway, the representative said she would keep my name on file, and I can get that refurbished unit at any time.  The reason I bought the Pro III, was the fact I didnt want to be without a vacuum sealer in my kitchen...........period."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Simply great,"Perfect for baking bread--I never again will need to scrape flour off my wooden table after kneading. I've never used it for pie crusts, since I always use two layers of  plastic wrap for that, but I honestly can't imagine that _anything_ would stick to this. My bread dough has gotten much better since I don't need to use so much extra flour when I knead and shape it"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,I love the towels,"The towel is thick and super-soft.  For its price, this is a very good buy.  I bought two, and even after washing, they are even softer and I love the towel.  The color (Blue Mist) is pretty and want to buy some more. "

kitchen & housewares,22 of 26,2.0,Can't really recommend this machine,"This model has been well received by others but I can't recommend it to you. I had a Krups Novo Espresso for 15 years, which was a great machine, and made fantastic espresso quickly with no fuss. The Carezza 35004 is just a pain in the neck and does not make good espresso. It needs to be ""primed,"" which takes heat-up time and a whole process, just to get the machine ready to make coffee. With my machine, not only did the pump not work predictably, but the espresso, when it did brew, was bitter and watery. I've been making espresso for 15 years and know what it takes -- this machine simply does not make good espresso. Perhaps the more expensive Carezza machines work properly, but this one is a dud. In addition to an annoying startup process and watery coffee, the machine is also hard to clean once a cup has been made; the coffee grounds are so wet, instead of coming out in the filter basked for disposal, they adhere to the ""shower screen"" and drip like tar onto everything when you try to manually clean it. All in all, a mess, and one additional annoyance you don't need in the morning. I read that the newer Krups' were not as good as the old ones, so I can't recommend those from personal experience. But maybe $199 is too little for a decent espresso machine; you might have to pay more for a reasonable experience. "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Split within a year,"I purchased this block in Dec. 2002.  We moved into our new home in January 2003 and this block split in two places by the end of 2003.  We treated it exactly as it says - lots of mineral oil and only occasional washing.  Disappointing, now I am inclined to buy a thinner cutting board"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,2.0,Works but low quality,"I purchased two because the price was great.  However, the quality is low due to large manufacturing tolerances.  On one unit, the top did not fit the base, making the spinning difficult.  Oddly, by swaping the top on one unit with the base on the 2nd unit, both could be made to work adequatly.  However, once you have spun your greens, there is no way to remove the snapped on top because there is nothing to grab on to.  You have to pull up on the spinning knob, which means the unit will not last long.  I would not purchase again because it is so difficult to use.  Perhaps the unit you buy will fit better.  Good luck"

Pile them high with you favorite fillings, and this panini maker with an adjustable top press, keeps them altogether. Heats fast, makes nice crunchy crusts, and is easy to clean. It also stores on its side, which makes it possible to leave on the counter. I haven't tried others but I'd surely buy this one again."

At first I was thrown off by the humongous un-aesthetically pleasing lid, but I bought it anyway at Linens 'n Things (for $60) cuz it was a much cheaper option than Calphalon or Emerilware woks.  To my surprise, this wok works great and was definitely worth the money.   The huge lid is great for steaming, and if you have the storage space for it, go ahead this item wouldn't disappoint yo"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,This itty bitty book light is an itty bitty wonder.,"I am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product. I purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and AC adapter about 5 years ago and I am still using it. I replaced the light bulb for the first time (replacement comes in the set I bought) last year when it started flickering and died. The book light has been used a great deal and I have accidently left it on for full nights before. I am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about 30 mins of usage...This is the only down side I can think of. The battery pack has its advantages... you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive. I prefer using the AC adapter. This might be why I never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time. It fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks. You can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want. Over the last year, my boyfriend has bought at least 3 LED booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them. He has been stealing my booklight to read with and I am force to use the poor night stand lighting. The funny thing is... I had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a LED book light. Now I am on this page again to buy another one for myself"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,1.0,I wouldnt buy this again,"Received this for a wedding present. 1 year later it began leaking water all over the counter when you filled it up. Triedto contact Cuisinart- they would never reply. So we had to stop setting it up at nite, or else we would have all of that water on teh counter/floor. For a while we just put in more water than needed for the pot and hoped it wentfast. finallygave up and bought a $30 machine which is still working great 1.5 years later.. I googled this problem and lots ofother people have had it and had no luck getting Cuisinart to do anything."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,The name says it all !,"Calphalon a name that brings to mind heavy duty pans and heavy price tags.  Well I sprung for these pans and cannot be more delighted.  The pans do not stick at all, I can go from stove to oven with no worries.  The pans are heavy also they are not something that is going to let food burns in an instant I get consistant heating in the whole pan.  The lids are something to be desired as you they are not glass and you cannot see through them, but oh well.  This is a great set and worth every single dollar!"

kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Don't buy this one!,"This steamer worked for about a week and then starter to work intermintently. HOT water was condensing in the hose and spilling out of the unit. The hot water burned my wife. I sent the unit back to CONAIR, they refunded my money, but said that this was normal operation and that their engineers found no problems with the unit. I seems that they think a unit that spills boiling hot water on you is normal. I have since replaced it with a different brand and have had no propblems. Pass this one by"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Best Grater Yet,"I loooove cheese, so I need a grater that can handle a pound or two with ease.  The hand graters may take up less space, but take a lot more energy to use and are not versatile.  Plus the box grater's flat sides make for much better grating surfaces than the curved hand graters usually have."

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Highest recommendation.,"I've enjoyed mine for 15 years, my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years, not sure how old my grandma's is, all still run great. Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Best cornbread I have ever had!,"This pan makes the best cornbread I have ever had! These cornsticks have a crispy crust all over, much better than cornbread squares or wedges, which have crust only on a few sides. Plus, my four-year-old son loves the cute shape of the cornbread. I was initially afraid the cornsticks would not release well from the pan, but I had no problems at all. I think people who have experienced sticking with this pan must not have seasoned it properly. Before the first use, I followed the manufacturer's instructions for seasoning the pan -- this is crucial! Then, to bake, you preheat the pan with a little bit of shortening in it for ten minutes in a preheated oven. Take the pan out to fill with cornbread batter, and put it right back in the oven to bake for about 15 minutes. The cornsticks don't simply fall out if you turn the pan upside down; rather, you have to take a fork or knife or spatula and lift them out. I find the non-stick properties of this pan just get better with each use, as the carbonization on the surface develops. I am so glad I got this pan"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 20,2.0,Set doesn't live up to KitchenAid standards.,"I got a set just like this as a Christmas gift two years ago. I'm a fan of KitchenAid, and I have a lot of appliances and gadgets from them, but this particular set was a disappointment... maybe I just got a ""lemon""."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Great for small batches of baby food!,"I would give this mixer 5 stars, except that I need to buy my third mixer in 11 years. Its nice to have one tool that is a mixer, can make healthy fruit smoothies, AND can make small batches of homemade baby food. I used this small chopper to make baby food for all 4 of my kids, the mixer to make cakes and other things, and the blender for smoothies for the kids. If you have babies, or plan on having them, this is great to have. The bad thing, is that the motor burns out. I don't feel I abuse it, or overuse it, but my first mixer burned out in about 5 years, my second in another 5 years. This is not a long term appliance. My current multimix is a 280 watt, but my first one was smaller wattage I believe"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,4.0,Not for for the meek of range (or weak of arm),"I should go to the gym more and I am reminded of this every time I use this pot.  It is an excellent pot, but when filled, it is heavy.  It also puts your range to the test.  That's a lot of water to heat.  As long as you plan in advance, it's not a problem."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 7,2.0,I got what I paid for! Fiestaware 1-qt pasta bowls,"While seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $4.99, I didn't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago. What a great price! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day. The packing is nice and secure. The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,A wonderful surprise!,"I have to 2nd the reviewer who said these were MUCH nicer than expected for the price -- extremely well made, stand up to any heat, sturdy thick stainless steel handles, silicone part is not floppy, and BIG.  A real bargain at $13"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,it cracked after using it for 2 wks !!!!,This cutting board was ok only for 2 wks. One day I found a huge crack across the board. I never dropped or did anything to make that huge crack. This one is simply not worth the money. I will never buy this brand again. Paying $50 for a cutting board that only last 2 wks? It was a huge mistake!!
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Not  Your Mother's Magnalite!,"I own five pieces of this cookware branded Magnalite. Four pieces were my mother's. She had them for over thirty years. They were made and marked by General Housewares Corp (GHC), an Indiana company, at their plant in Sidney, Ohio. The fifth piece was made there too but not by GHC and that's the problem. GHC made Magnalite up until 1995 when they sold the name Magnalite and the plant. The fourth piece I own was made in Ohio after 1995 by another company. Though it looks similiar in design, it is measurably half the thickness and weight of my mother's pieces. There is also another company that is using the name Magnalite that is making them in China. Replacement parts for the new Magnalite will not fit the original old pieces. So todays Magnalite is not the same as your mother's. Be advised"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great deal for just $9.99,A great deal for just $9.  Just a few thoughts on this item;
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"Good, basic pitcher",I make a latte every morning and this pitcher works well.  It's big enough to allow me to put enough milk in it for my tall latte without the foam overflowing.  The handle sticks out far enough from the body of the pitcher to make it easy to turn the pitcher while I'm steaming the milk.  The only drawback is the somewhat wide bottom which can bump against my machine when I'm steaming. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,One Awesomd Fondue Pot,"This is all you could ever want in a Fondue pot.  So much so, I bought two of them!  It heats up quickly, cools down quickly and absolutely nothing sticks.  As another reviewer stated, ""Goodbye Sterno!""  Works equally well with cheese, meats and seafood"

Also, after 6 months of use the insides rusted and became unuseabl"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,Bad...bad.... bad,This rice cooker makes poor rice.  The inner pot is too thin and the rice gets burned on the bottom.  If you really want a good rice cooker buy a Micom unit like Sanyo.   You'll pay a little more but atleast you'll have good rice
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Works like a dream,"This knife works really well, am pleased with the purchase.  It's been working great for cleaning fish fillets, just feels like a dream not having to use a traditional knife for that part of it, and much faster.  I plan on purchasing another one just like it, so my wife can have hers back in the kitchen."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Good value, nice vac","This little vacuum has a good bit of suction power compared to others in its price range.  A single charge gets me a long running time.  However, my wife puts the vacuum back on the charger after she uses it for 1 minute... so, the battery has now established a memory.... so it only last about 5 minutes per charge now.  Like anything with a Ni-Cad battery, the power must be full drained before recharging.  I wish manufacturers would start using Ni-Mh or Li-Ion batteries.. or a smart charging system... I digress..."

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,"Love the board, hate the packaging!","I absolutely love this cutting board.  It works well with most knives (don't use the serrated knives with tiny teeth).  The board is very forgiving with repeated cutting.  They are very heavy and very attractive.  The only complaint I have is the paper packaging stuck to the board.  I've bought 3 of these and I couldn't get all of the ""glue"" off any of the boards.  I eventually just put the oil on the boards to protect them and that somehow helped get most of the sticky residue off.  MIU France really needs to use something that will not permanently stick to the boards.  I'd give it a 5 star if the sticky residue and paper came off easily"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Bowls - Poor packing,"I ordered a set and the handle was broken on one bowl. Contacted amazon for a replacement and received it in two days. None broke. Amazon paid postage to return the broken ones. These are super bowls, hold a nice serving and the handles are not big and bulky. Amazon's packing is fine, Sango's packing is inadequate for shipping. However, a few hoops to go through to get a whole set but worth it. Amazon is pretty great to return an item through"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,farberware review,A fine product providing even heating for all recipes that I cook with it.  The three quart saucepan is especially handy for preparing side dishes for a family of 7 as it holds a quantity that provides for more than enough servings for this family.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Nonstick Skillet,"I bought this Farberware Millennium Soft Touch Stainless Steel 10-inch Nonstick Skillet because I had recently bought Farberware Millennium Soft Touch Stainless Steel 12-Inch Nonstick Skillet and was very happy and completely satisfied with it.  It is sturdy, heavy duty, and easy to clean -- I would recommend it highly. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Good for the price.,"I only gave it 4 stars because I have had it for less than a month. I usually wait longer to review a product because sometimes defects take two or three months to show up. So far this little vacuum has been a good investment. I use it only for crumbs, some cat hair in the carpets or sofas, and any small clean up between vacuuming. This little machine works really well for all that. The house looks better, I have to get the big vacuum out less often (once a week instead of two) and things are really tidier. Also I love how easy it is to clean up. It was definitely a very good purchase"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,great pan,This was my first calaphalon purchase and I am so impressed that I plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future. This pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1/2 qt pans.The unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food. Hand washing the pan is easy. I love this pan !!
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,It does what it does perfectly,I love this thing.  I've had mine now for 2 months.  I bought it as a replacement for the toaster/egg poacher combo unit that never did work right.  This works perfectly every time.  I use it most often for 1 soft boiled egg. I use a whiskey jigger (that I just keep under the dome when not in use) that holds the exact amount of water.  I use this thing every day and it never fails me. 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Why I love this pan and Calphalon...,"    When I first got this pan I thought it was a little heavy, but after using it...love it.  I have been able to saute onions and potatoes to a flavorful brown, scramble eggs to perfection, cook pork chops and the pan still cleans up so easy. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect,I love this spatula. At first I thought it was an odd and bulky item to have in my kitchen but when I used it for wipping down the side of my KA stand mixer (I have an Accolade) it worked perfectly! It is a bit big for putting in the drawer so I have it hung up but I love the fact that KA made it so it works just perfectly with their KA stand bowls

kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,4.0,Butter comes in different sizes!,"I bought the fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living in Arizona.  The butter sold there is packaged in shorter, wider, and higher sized sticks.  So, it didn't fit into the butter dish unless I trimmed it!!  Couldn't figure it out, why would they make a butter dish that a stick of butter won't fit into??!!  So....have just moved to the Houston area, and guess what, the butter here is sized just right for the dish.  Maybe they need to make two different sizes for west and east coast butter??  Crazy!  Nice butter dish, though"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Delicious honey muffins,"I have used this only once and it outperformed my standard metal muffin pans.  This was tested by creating a batch of honey muffin batter, oiling two metal pans and this silicone pan, filling them each with the batter.  After visually inspecting and taste testing the muffins, the dozen baked in the silicone pan were far better in appearance and taste than their metal counterparts.  I will gladly amend this review should it not perform equally well with a cake batter"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Warning: Steam is hot.,"There is actually a warning to that effect included with this product.  If you're the type of person that needs that warning, you probably shouldn't buy any product with a heat source.  "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Best so far!,"So far I have been very happy with my Zo. I agree with others about the low baking temp...on med., my bread was much lighter than expected, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the loaf was undercooked. It was well formed and airy, just looked like I had baked it on a lower setting. "
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Better Butter Dish,"Fiestaware ROCKS.  A few years back, I started my Fiestaware collection. The butter dish, in turquoise, was a recent addition.  I like the vibrant colors available which allow for a cheerful, eclectic mix or a more coordinated theme. It is of the highest quality and very durable in the oven as well.  I am going to put glass doors on my cabinets to showcase my Fiestaware because not only is it practical and beautiful, they are individual pieces of art! "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,2.0,Are you kidding me?!?,"I just received this item as a gift, so I can't attest to its durability. I will tell you this, though....get ready for the fight of a life, just to use this cutting board. Kitchenaid, a company manufacturing products for food preparation use, has stumbled upon the most chemically-impervious substance in the known universe, and used it to attach their labels to this item - not just on 1 side, but on BOTH. After attempting to remove the glue residue with lighter fluid then nail polish remover, and ruining a brand new sponge trying to power through it, I think it's ALMOST gone."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice pot for gumbo,"I made a very large batch of shrimp gumbo in this pot yesterday that nearly filled the pot.  The pot gets used often and has held up well.  Fortunately for me I paid 1/3 of the Amazon price with free shipping and no tax.  Should have bought more than one.  I am amazed that Amazon sells this for virtually the same price as Williams-Sonoma, the price-gougers of cookware suppliers. I love Amazon but this price is too high"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Mike McNally,"Pros: it sits on top of the receptacle instead of hanging into it, like many other food mills do (including many priced much higher); the bowl and disks are all stainless and don't rust like my old one; it's made of metal and not plastic (again, old one)"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,It's Saved My Relationship!,"I was always lazy when it came to scooping the cat box.  I was so bad that I would go several days without cleaning and would have to clean not only the entire box, but the surrounding areas.  It was nasty and I was definitely not earning any brownie points with my spousal unit."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Breaks every 2-3 months. Only used by one cat.,"After 2-3 months of use by our cat, it broke (the rake mechanism won't move). So we sent a part back and the receipt as told by their service dept along with $10 and they sent a new one. Now about 3 months later that one is broken. So, I'm assuming we won't be able to get one again since we sent in the receipt the first time. Sometimes it got stuck and kept going back and forth because the rake got stuff stuck on it. I would recommend either buying a sturdier/more powerful box (maybe that would work) or a different brand. When it works it is awesome though"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Very useful kitchen appliance,I bought a large slow cooker from amazon and ordered this smaller  model about a week later -- it's a handy size for smaller dishes. It's an ideal design. And it turns out incredible oatmeal! Among many other dishes. It's the perfect size for a three- or four-pound chicken.

kitchen & housewares,37 of 38,1.0,Displeased,"The 45-piece Finlandia dinnerware set is NOT made in England but in COLUMBIA and is a poor knock-off of the REAL Enlish made Churchill China Finandia dinnerware. The colors were faded on all of the salad plates, some of the dinner plates did not have the pattern completely printed on them, and the platter did not have the flower emblem centered in the middle of the platter. There were also glazing drips on the back of some of the plates. NOT THE REAL CHURCHILL CHINA. I am returning the entire 45-piece set and ordering the 20 pc. set that IS made in England. "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Extremely Happy With Pie Pan,"I used my Cuisinart pie pan to make a pecan pie for Christmas.  This particular pie always gave me sticking problems with my old Pyrex pie dish.  The pecan pie was beautiful in the new pan, and each piece came out neat and clean.  Cleanup was very easy.  I made a quiche for New Years with equally great results.  Neither the pie nor the quiche was ""deep-dish"", but the crust was easy to roll into an attractive edge about an inch below the top of the pan.  I couildn't be happier"

MY PANCAKES AND FRENCH TOAST COME OUT PERFECT. THE GRIDDLE CLEANS EASILY. ON THE CON SIDE, IT SEEMS TO TAKE A BIT LONG FOR THE AREA NOT OVER A BURNER TO HEAT UP BUT ONCE THAT AREA DOES HEAT UP, IT, TOO, PRODUCES A NICE, GOLDEN BROWN.  MY GREATEST COMPLAINT IS THE WEIGHT OF THE GRIDDLE/GRILL. IT IS QUITE HEAVY THUS MAKING IT HARD TO HANDLE WHEN CLEANING AND STORING, ESPECIALLY FOR ME AS I STORE IT ON A SHELF THAT IS OVER MY HEAD SO LIFTING IT TO THE SHELF TAKES A GOOD BIT OF STRENGTH.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Not just a pot,"Hey, I know it sounds weird to review a pot (I mean it's a pot, right?) but it is a good one.  Nothing sticks, we can clean it and still have time to have a life and it boils water turned to medium because, well, who knows? but it somehow conducts heat and works great to get the job done FAST.  That's important because I work as a professor and a therapist and a mom of a teen who runs cross country (and eats more pasta than a stereotype) and a toddler (who eats and throws more pasta than his brother) so fast and efficient get high scores at our house.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,OUTSTANDING,"I have gone thru over a dozen coffee grindrs in the past. Sams Club now sells Starbucks French Roast BEANS in 3 pound bags and it takes an hour standing at their grinder to get espresso grind. What a pain. I couldn't afford a commercial one like they have at Starbucks outlets so I went to DeLonghi on the internet whre I bought several things and there was this Retro Burr Grinder. I couldn't resist and the price was more than reasonable. Got it home and read the instructions which were very simple. Filled up the hopper and...voila! I couldn't be happier. So simple top use and you can leave the ground coffee in the lower hopper to last the week. no more having to grind each morning before getting to make the coffee. I couldn't be happier! Did I already say that? Anyway, it is nowhere near as loud as my little one that will be in the bag for the Big Brothers & Sisters collection"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,So far so good.,"I used it once, and it worked fine.  No smoke as mentioned by another reviewer.  I found that it cleaned up just as well as a non-stick metal pan.  I just hope they don't come out in a few years and say all this silicone is poison like teflon! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,A Great Little Pot!,"This is a great little pot for sauteeing onions before adding a 28 oz. can of Italian tomatoes, or for risotto for 1 to 4 people. Don't be put off by the small size; if you cook for one or two people and appreciate QUALITY cookware then this is the pot for you. Worth every penny."

They are molded in one piece of clear acrylic with the super-jumbo olive on a &quot;toothpick&quot; in the drink part. Because the glass and the drink are not separate layers, the olive is highly enlarged by the sides. It still will look faboo with your scale figures. Just snip off the pick and file the bottom of the glass until it sits flat. It is not molded flat, for mold release reasons, so this will take about a half hour each with a needle file.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,4.0,Can't do it all but what did you expect...,"After reading the negative reviews I felt I had to put my 2 cents worth in. For what it's worth, I've owned a mini-prep for about 8 or 9 years and have been extremely happy with it. While I acknowledge that it does not do the best job of chunk chopping, it does do a great job on emulsions, spices and (especially) garlic butter for garlic bread. By processing in small batches and pulsing on low, you can get acceptable chopping for salsa ingredients, etc. The one thing I do stay away from is grating cheese. I tried it once and thought I was going to kill my mini-prep, I grate by hand. As far as clean-up goes, you need to use a glove, dish rag, or (my personal favorite) sponge to remove the blade from the shaft so you don't get cut by the blade. "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great Crate,"I bought this to house train my Landseer Newfie.  Well constructed, easy to assemble and large enough for my puppy to grow.  His expected size is 150 lbs.  If you are purchasing this for house training a puppy, I suggest you get one with a divider, or you could just use a box inside it"
kitchen & housewares,20 of 23,2.0,Battery cover broke after a couple of months,"For [money] I'd expect a little more quality.  I've had to tape the cover back on.  Overall the thermometer was a little disappointing.  It takes about 5-10 seconds to get a stable reading.  It's not exactly instant read, but it seems accurate.  The min and max memory is useful, but they are a little tedious to reset.  On the plus side, the auto-off feature is nice since it save batteries"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Excellent digital oven thermometer,"I've owned this unit for several years and have used it countless times for foods cooked in the oven, on the stovetop and in my Weber grill. To those who say it fails I would say it is almost certainly the probe that has failed. The probes are not indestructible and should be considered a consumable item. However, if you are very careful, a probe can last two years or more. I went through about 3 or so probes a year in the first couple of years I had the device, but I've been using the same probe now for 2 years or more."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,perfect for sphynx cats,"I have been looking for a product like this for ages!!! My sphynx (hairless) cat loves to sleep on the {snuggle safe} disc while I am at work, and I don't have to worry about it catching on fire like a heating pad or some other electronically controlled device"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Don't Waste Your Money and Your Time,"This nutmeg grinder looks nice, but only works about 5% of the time.  You can grind until you're blue in the face and nothing happens.  Unless you want to spend your day taking the nutmeg out, readjusting it and hoping something will happen, buy something else."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,4.0,Great Vacuum,"I purchased A Hoover Foldaway two years ago. I was dissatisfied with it. However, I purchased this vacuum about a month ago, and I am extremely satsified with it. This one seems to have more power than my old one. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone who asked. I love the suction that this vacuum has!!!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 11,4.0,professional 600 6-quart stand mixer,"I have been wanting this product for a long time. As a chef I can only say, I only want the best and biggest! I had to cater a wedding for my girlfriends son. I made 200 stuffed little red potatoes. So, for a first test it held up real well. I filled the bowl to full capacity, three times. The machine held up well! Not bad for a first test. The the only reason I gave it 4 stars, was because I have only used it once! I had read some negative reviews, so I was hesitant to buy it at first! The only thing I didn't care for, was the fact that it has a slight delay when turning it on. I know this is a built in safety feature, but Im used to a 1950's model. That 50's model is still in use today. That's why I bought this in the first place!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,good for the $,Nice and sturdy silicon spatula. Scrapes great in any situation. Recommended
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,4.0,Excellent Value For The Price,I am sure you can spend a lot more on a cheese grater -- but why? This cheese grater works just fine and my friends are blown away when I whip it out and a block of fresh romano or parmesan. That little green can from Kraft can't compare and fresh cheese is actually cheaper!
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Hated I didn't try it sooner,"I've probably had this disc for a year.  I just used it for the first time last week.  I hate I waited so long.  I've been using it on potatoes to make hashbrowns and it is wonderful.  (If you love Waffle House hashbrowns, this gets you closer to their texture.) "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Great for large families - where 1 coffee maker doesn't fill the need,"We have a large (extended) family living in one household and we go through 4-5 pots of coffee in a day.  This urn is an inexpensive way for us to meet the demands of all the coffee drinkers here.  And everyone likes the coffee it makes.  The only thing I miss that I have on the drip machine is the timer (we have a couple of very early risers) and easy on/off.  We attached ours to a timer so that it will start brewing early enough.  One other thing - not a complaint, but a note about how it works, since it is a percolater, it takes longer to brew.  Expect about 20 minutes for a full pot."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Excellent timer!,"It counts up!  It counts down!  It counts in seconds and minutes, and in minutes and hours!  It vibrates, flashes, and beeps!  It stands up, clips to things, or hangs by the sheer power of magnetism!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Better than you think,"I can't believe how much more juice I get from limes than I used to using my old green hand lime squeezer. With the cost of limes this machine may actually pay for itself at some point. It is easy to use, easy to clean and doesn't move on the counter when operating. I'd buy another one if I needed more than one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,My new best knife friend,Such a great bargain for such a sharp and practical knife. This outshines several older and more expensive cooking knives in our kitchen.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Kitchenaid stand mixer,"I had wanted this product for years, and it's every bit as wonderful as I had imagined. The cost of the item had always put me off,but when I saw it at Amazon.com ,refurbished, I bought it. It should last me for the rest of my life"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,Great Easy Cleaning,"I had bought my first George Foreman grill at Walmart and it made my food taste exactly like a charcoal grill, but the cleaning was horrible and lengthy."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,great grater,"First, the grater in the above picture is not the one that showed up at my doorstep.  The grater I received has a black handle, a fine grate, and does not have anything to catch food when it falls.  However, it still works great!  I like it most for hard cheeses and it is very sharp- watch your fingers- not a good tool for a kid to use helping out his/her mom in the kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,The Perfect Pyrex Set,"I recently recieved this starter set as a housewarming gift! It is so practical! I don't know how I survived so long without owning Pyrex. It's great for cooking in, as well as storing food. Tomorrow I will cook a casserole in the rectangular container and then put the lid on it to store the leftovers after dinner. It's easier than having to transfer food from the pan to a storage container. :)  "
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,classy mission style furniture,"I have 4 of these in my home and I love them. The shelves are adjustable and the unit is easy to assemble. The instructions are pictures only and the pictures so closely match the subtle differences in each piece, the only way you will mess up assembly is if you try to do it without referring to the schematic. Using the proper tools and not over-tightening the screws, the shelves should theoretically last forever as long as you are only loading books & not bricks in the shelves. I accent my shelves with knick-knacks along with the books. The simple style is beautiful without being boring and the color is rich. If you can't afford custom and/or raw furniture, this is the next best thing - and it doesn't look like cheesy laminate stuff like those O'Sullivan kits"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Outstanding Value!,"For the price, we expected an ""ok"" knife, but instead found this knife to be superior to many others we own, including Cutco. We are glad we made the purchase. Delivery was very timely"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Best Knife in Kitchen,"My brother made a salsa with this knife while I was visiting and I asked about the knife. He let me try it and I fell in love. Every member of my family now owns this knife and is it the favorite among all the henckels I own. The heft, balance, edge and handle are perfect. It moves like part of your hand. This knife is worth 120 dollars at least. Buy it and never look back"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Circulon Lid,This product was a wonderful accessory for my toss and turn pan. The handle is always cool and there is no steam buildup. A definate must accessory
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great little stockpot,"Stands up to the Cuisinart brand name.  Great little pot for a pan full of chilli, soups or stew.  Heats evenly without any hotspots, clean-up is a breeze, and the price is great.  What more could you wan"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Corningware cover,"I love the cover, it fits an open casserole that I already had and has been used several times since I bought it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,Doesn't heat oil to correct temperature,"This is the second fryer we have purchased, and we are sorry we did.  We had a DeLonghi that we really liked, but got tired of the clean up, so decided to give this one a try.  Even after preheating for over 15 minutes at the highest temperature, the temperature of the oil never gets high enough to correctly fry the food. (I used a cooking thermometer to test the temperature on several different occasions; even after the 15 minute preheat, the temp. was at least 20 degrees too low. As every good fryer knows, correct temperature is key to great fried foods.)  Everything comes out a bit soggy, and just doesn't have that great ""fried flavor.""  We have used this fryer 5 or 6 times, and now it's headed for the trash can."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love My Sango Concepts Avocado!!!,"This is a great looking set of tableware!  I love the shape of the large plates! The bowls are just the right size and the coffee cups are shaped so you can get a good grip on that morning cup of coffee! The soft green color with brown accents is so pleasing to the eye and can be dressed up or down. It does great in the microwave too!  I am trying to find additional serving pieces which I heard were going to be out anytime, but cannot find any photos."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great small skillet,"I'm a fan of Caphalon and when I decided to replace my 7"" skillet with an 8"" one I immediately looked to the Professional series of Calphalon with a non-stick interior. I have not been disappointed. This is a nice size for two people whether it be an omelette or using it for prep work for another dish. It has a heavy gauge body and conducts the heat well. The non-stick surface is great for easy clean-up. The sides are high enough so stirring food is not an issue. I was slightly concerned about the configuration of the handle--my other ones are solid and this one is turned metal and open on the bottom. The edges near where it is attached to the pan seemed like they might be sharp but now that I've used the pan for a month or more this is not a problem.The handle does not get hot. I would highly recommend this omelette pan if you are looking for the 8"" size"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love it!,"This product is almost totally nonstick and cleans wonderfully. The corners of this turner fit the curve of my skillets and pull every bit of food around as I stir. Also is very strong and can lift a real load. One person commented on the weight of the handle, but the joy of this product is that you can lay it against the skillet lip without hurting it at all.  All in all, I am very pleased with this product and intend on checking out the slotted model next as well as the spoon/spatula"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Pretty neat,"I really liked the set of silicone bakeware I received for Christmas. Mine do not leave a funny taste, like some have complained, and they are a snap to clean up. Ease of clean up is the sole reason I wanted them. I eventually would like to get rid of all my bakeware that is metal, except cookie sheets"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Pfalzgraff Sedona 4-piecedinnerware place setting,Those that are into southwestern decor will love this dinnerware set.  It is unfortunate additional matching pieces are too expensive
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Worked for a while...,"I purchased this ice cream scoop after I ruined one of the antifreeze scoops by washing it in the dishwasher. The scoop works well. However, although it was advertised as dishwasher safe, the inside of the scoop has begun to pit. Also, the handle collects water in the dishwasher, which slowly leaks out in the drawer. I'm tossing it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great product,"I bought an entire stainless steel calphalon cookware set, and it is the best purchase for the kitchen I have made.  Food cooks evenly and quickly, without burning.  Clean up is very quick and easy, even with the pots and pans without non-stick coating.  So, I don't know why you would need to waste dishwasher space when clean up is so easy.  Even when my husband burned soup in a saucepan, after letting it cool, then putting hot water in it, it was very easy to clean, and without any ""scars"" from the incident. I'm very pleased"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Not a very useful chopper,I was very disappointed in this item.  The first time I used it was to chop a selection of fresh herbs.  The blades were very dull and struck the herbs a number of times without cutting them.  The result was a mess of pulverized oregano.  Perhaps I got a defective item but it was not at all useful
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,Light Iron does wonderful job!,I purchased this item based on the reviews.  It really is very very light.  I was suprised at how quickly its heated up and ready to go and how quickly it cools down and can be easily stored.  Its design allows the heated part of the iron not to touch when you set it down and it also acts as a wrap for the cord.  The steam is great and powerful.  It comes with it's own water pouring cup for steam too.  Very satisfied
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,1.0,one star henckles breakable knife~,"after reading reviews of this knife and others, my husband came to the conclusion that this knife would be the best christmas present for me.  and it was for about 5 days.  it cut wonderfully and felt perfect in my hand.  after i was washing the knife off after cutting an onion, i noticed a crack in the blade!!  so i sent it back for another one, and that one was defective.  the divits that are on the sides of the blades (to keep food from sticking to the knife) were off centered and went off the blade's edge instead of running above it.  so i sent that back for another one.  then amazon said lots of other people were having problems, too, so they did not have any more in stock.  i gave up then.  i am using my refund money towards a trip to california..."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,Rusted Solid,This was a great can opener...until it rusted. The gears ceased turning. But I liked it enough to replace it with the stainless version
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,What a waste of time!!!,"My new hubby and I recently registered for this product and soon after we got it for our shower gift!  After waiting months until after the wedding, we were so happy to open the items.  Well, that was our mistake!  We ended up having ugly, dirt, rusty looking spots all over the set after washing them only a few times.  After a month or so, I was fed up.  I tried different detergents in the dishwasher and such, but that didn't help.  I spoke with the company themselves about a cash refund, due to the fact that the boxes have been discarded, but the best they could do was send me a new set.  Well, that set did the same thing!  After spending money and time I am fed up with this product and Cambridge Silversmiths.  I am going to throw  both of the sets away and hopefully have some more luck with another company!!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 11,4.0,Sharp but not cutting edge...,"I was expecting to create a knife edge that I could shave with. Well, maybe not that sharp, but sharp enough to cut a piece of paper like butter. Maybe I've seen too many movies. Anyway, the sharpener is easy to use but the full verdict is not out yet. Thus far, thus good"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,beautiful and functional,"If you haven't seen one yourself, be advised they are more beautiful in person than photographed.  They keep a hot beverage hot longer than a cup with a lid and are much more convenient."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Indoor Grill,"What a great product!  My husband and I both love it.  We put dinner on the grill, set the timer and wait for it to ring.  Since it cooks on both sides, there is no turning to do.  If we have guests, the grill opens out flat and cooks even more food.  We have a natural gas grill outside, but this is great when it is just the two of us or it is raining"
kitchen & housewares,22 of 22,1.0,Me Too!,"My cobalt pyrex baking dish, too, exploded in the oven, today while cooking a normal dinner. Do not use cobalt pyrex dishes. I have never heard of a clear dish doing this but see that many reviewers have had this happen with the cobalt."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,Beautiful but not long lasting," I bought this cutting board I thought by a great price. The first one that arrived had a crack, I returned and asked for a new one. Very promptly Amazon sent a replacement without any crack. I was very happy for about one month until one day when I'm taking the board to use it, I see several cracks in the bamboo... Careful about this product, you can be wasting your money"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Terrific pot for the price,"This pan is excellent for sauces, soups and vegetables and the 3-qt. size is very versatile. The handles stay relatively cool on the stove and takes up less space than most single-handled pans when storing it in the refrigerator. Cleanup is quite easy. Overall, a handsome and utilitarian pan and well worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great deal,It was a great deal for the price. Looks very nice in my guest room. Will buy it again
kitchen & housewares,0 of 2,2.0,spend a little more to get something nicer....,"I was surprised when I opened the package for this product -- it wasn't anything like how I'd imagined it. This cookie sheet is very flimsy and cheap feeling, almost like a one-time use product. Plus, everything sticks to it relentlessly. I'm not sure I'm going to get much use out of it, and I wish I'd spent a few dollars more to get something more substantial"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 18,5.0,Not Aluminium Core,"I have this pan and the box says solid Stainless Steel. So, be aware that you aren't getting a aluminium.  I think dealers don't realize that not all All-Clad products are aluminium.  It's a nice pan anyways"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,fiestaware at Amazon,"I hadn't used Amazon before and did so at the suggestion of my sister.  Amazon had the products that I wanted, at good prices, and the ordering process was easy.  I did have the need to return an item, due to an error on my part.  I followed the return procedure and it went smoothly, without a hitch.  Very convenient. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Compare With Other Stoneware...,"If you already own the Sango Splash dinnerware set and are interested in purchasing a couple of baking pieces you can't go wrong with the Square Baker, Lasagna, Casserole or Au Gratin pieces in this line.  Not only do these pieces coordinate with the Splash pattern but they can go from oven (500 degrees) or microwave, to tabletop, into the fridge with the leftovers, and then on to the dishwasher.  These pieces offer versatility and style at a great price.  Genuine value"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,I love that whisk!,"Wow, after seeing the one bad review, I just had to add my five cents.  I absolutely love that whisk.  It gets into the hard-to-each corners of any pot and won't harm the surface of non-stick cookware that's metal utensil-safe.  I think it's gentler on anything non-stick because the balls at the ends simply do not scratch.  I use this whisk when making sauces that start with a flour base because I will not have a single lump, period.  Regular whisks tend to splash a lot more and simply do not work as well.  The first time you use it it will feel a bit strange, but if the previous reviewer had used it a little longer than 20 seconds she might have come to appreciate its ingenious design.  Cleanup is a snap because nothing can get trapped within the open design.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED, VERY NICE!","I've owned this set for a few months now, replacing a cheaper set of Farberware, and am highly-satisfied. They are attractive, well-made, have a nice heft, and continue to cut well without sharpening (which is one of the primary reasons I purchased them). Though dishwasher-safe, I have chosen to wash them by hand to both preserve the edge and eliminate any possibility of corrosion. Another tip I picked up is to place the knives in the block upside-down, so that you're not pulling the blade across wood every time you remove them. I don't do this with all of them, as it didn't look very aesthetic, but do with the three in the middle (utility knives) which get used the most. A very nice set, well worth the money, just what I was looking for."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Great Pastry Brush!,This is a great pastry brush.  It is the perfect size for pastry.  It doesn't have the natural bristles described by Amazon but I have to say the nylon bristles it has are very easy to clean and work just as well.  I actually prefer the nylon bristles because I think they are much easier to clean and are much more sanitary than the natural bristles.  Well worth the $.  Highly recommended
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Sturdy Ramp but Difficult and Ackward to Fold,Good sturdy ramp supports a lot of weight and gives great traction to the animal but it is difficult and ackward to fold up and takes up a lot of room in the car.  I would love this product if it came in a telescoping version
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,loving it,"A bit weighty at 10lbs, but how can you go wrong with cast iron? I love it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,No need for review,"Anyone who knows Pyrex knows its products need no review. I grew up using my mom's pyrex measuring cups, so I didn't hesitate to buy these when I needed some of my own. The prices are always reasonable, and they are the most durable products. I received a gift certificate to Amazon from my brother, and I bought this cup, the 3-pc set and the Black & Decker 3-cup food chopper. I love them!!"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,"Not perfect, but not horrible.","I looked at a couple of dozen T/Os before selecting this one. My selection was based primarily on the size, the fact that it had two rack positions, four really, since the rack position can be changed by turning it over, four heating elements, and made the pretense of being able to make toast in addition to performing ovenly duties."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Bed sheets,I enjoy the silky feeling of the sheet.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love it!,"This is a great purchase. We use this toaster oven for roasting peppers, baking bread, cakes, fish and chicken dishes and, yes, for toasting bread. It performs all tasks to perfection. My husband thinks that it could take less time toasting bread, but I think the end result is worth the couple of minutes."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Works great,Did exactly what it was supposed to do and comes with different sized parts for smaller or larger fruit
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,most convienent scale I ever owned,"I love this scale.  Especially how I can put a bowl, measuring cup or whatever and on it and then hit the zero button. Then when I add ingredients I don't have to subtract the container weight.  I can add successive ingredients and hit the zero button each time. The large surface area handles most containers.  It is smaller and lighter than I expected and stores easily in the cupboard on it's side.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I am not sure of the accuracy for low weights.  Sometimes when I am adding(or subtracting) small increments the addition will not register and I am sure I have added enough.  Still, I am very pleased with this scale and wish I would have bought it a long time ago"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Dishwasher safe?,These are wonderful shears. I would never put ANY of my good knives in the dishwasher - including these shears. Handwashing is always recommended for good quality knives because it helps preseve the edge of the blade. (No matter WHAT brand they are!
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0, T-fal is the number one product pot,"I recommend this pot to every one wheather is professional or housewifes, is the greastest pot that I've used."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,BRING ON THE WAFFLES,"After shopping for over 2 years for a waffle baker and purchasing many $50 ones I decided to invest in one that would last and make restaurant type waffles.  After receiving this waffle iron and using it a couple of times we have decided we can make even better waffles than our favorite weekend restaurant.  Using a waffle mix and adding about a Tsp of lemon and lime juice, egg, milk, vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, setting the waffle baker at 3:30 the perfect waffle is baked.  This baker is heavy, bakes two at once, and never have I had a waffle stick.  We purchased our baker about 1 year ago.  Even our neighbors will call and ask if they can come over for breakfast now, and their request is a waffle.  Clean up is so easy, just wipe with a damp cloth.  I only wish I had invested in this waffle baker 15 years ago!!!  Next will be the pro line toaster!  If you have doubts, please do not, this baker is well worth the money, you will not regret the purchase"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Andrei Kolodovski,"The product works as it supposed to work, without any headaches, and I definitely save time planning my diet. Also, I think it's beautiful - looks nice in the kitchen, and the user interface is intuitive - it took me less than 5 minutes to learn how to use it. Overall, I feel I got good value for my money."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Better than expected,"Just received these dishes today and they are even more beautiful than pictured.  They are heavy and have the look and feel of much more expensive stoneware.  Had my first cup of coffee in the mug - great look and feel - but, better yet, when I microwaved the coffee the mug did not heat up.  It's hard to find dishes that don't heat up in the microwave.  You can't go wrong with this beautiful, understated set of dishes"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,This Frother is Great!,I bought two of these frothers. One for here in the U.S. and one for Family in Costa Rica. They are both working great! You have to follow directions when assembling. You also need to keep the units clean. I will buy this again
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Good for small batches of baby food,"I used this item to make homemade babyfood for my twins.  It was awesome, even though I wish it had a larger capacity.  For the price, it was well worth it.  Ours broke though because my husband decided to use it to crush ice (not smart) while I was out one day."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,4.0,Cuisinart Blades,"I don't yet own this specialty set, but am delighted to find it here on line after searching in stores.  One of my family recipes are Polish-style potatoe pancakes made with grated raw potatoes, flour, egg and seasonings.  What a chore to grate the potatoes by hand!  If the fine grated does this job, my family will enjoy this treat that they love more often, and my knuckles won't need to be included in the dish"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,So far so good,I love to julienne a lot of my vegetables but it can be a pain.  This makes it a LOT easier and my fingers don't hurt after I'm done (when I used the knife). It's a nifty little tool and it's affordable

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"quality, but heavy & tough to clean","the griddle works great, I have used it a ton. My only cautions are that it is super heavy and b/c it is cast iron, you need to clean and dry it thoroughly or it will rust. Overall, for the price it is well worth it"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Stir fry for one?  You got it!,"I'm a big Calphalon fan, so when I saw this pan for $19.99, I jumped at the opportunity to own it!  It's the most uniquely-shaped pan in my kitchen, making it versatile for a number of uses."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great wall mount!,We ordered this wall mount system for our mud room to hang coats and back packs (our daughter is in preschool so the back pack does not have a lot of heavy books).  This system was VERY easy to hang and came with all materials necessary for installation.  It looks great in our mud room and does not take up a lot of wall space
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,Useless,"I purchased 2 of these products and both were no good. the material they are made of chips off in small pieces, until the product begins to leak coffee all over the place. I feel this a manufacturing problem which the company needs to  correct. With the price being what it is I cannot feel justified in buying another. I have stored the coffee maker. I cannot use it"

Not only were your instructions (from 2004-10-30) clear and simple, but they actually worked. With your guidance, I have turned my Bionaire fan into a Porsche. Well, not exactly a Porsche, but at least it is now a somewhat accurate thermometer as well as a top-notch, incredibly quiet, window fan."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Can Opener,"I do not write many reviews but I wanted to express my opinion on this can opener. I have had so many problems with other openers in the past and I have finally found one that is not only durable but works GREAT! I had the OXO opener for the past year and it was ok but it it wore out quick. This can opener is much more durable and the ease of use is way better than the OXO. The price is definately worth it, in fact I am thinking of getting some of these for family members"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,OXO Salad Spinner,"I have put off buying this item as I felt it was a ""fad.""  Well, how wrong can person be.  I am above retirement age and I have always struggled with keeping lettuce fresh for any period of time.  This system with washing the lettuce in cold water, spinning it in the OXO and then using the other top to make the spinner a storage unit is the best ever.  My lettuce stays crisp (sometimes crisper than originally) for as long as it takes two of us to eat a head of Romaine.  Great product"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Excellent, easy to use product","After using the Fresh Flow Cat Fountain for a few months, my cats have adjusted to it well and it seems to be working perfectly. My vet recommended a fountain for one of my cats due to a slight kidney problem and this really seemed to do the trick to get her to drink more water from her bowl instead of from the sink faucets. The entire fountain comes apart easily for cleaning with soap and water (about once a week will keep it running smoothly without clogs) and the adjustable pump works great"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Read the Directions,"I got this flatware set for my birthday and so far I really like it. I was very hesitent about buying it because of all the reviews about how their sets rusted and pitted. Well inside the box you get a little brochure. This brochure explains how to take care of your flatware set to keep it from rusting and pitting. For example you can wash your flatware in the dish washer, but they recomend drying them by hand. All you have to do is read that brochure."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,1.0,"Loud, poorly made, waste of money, 1 star is too much","I don't normally review items, but this was such a waste of money I had to warn people.  First of all, the cheap plastic container is not dishwasher safe...something that should be made clear on the box.  When the motor is running, the plastic cannister vibrates, even when it is locked in correctly, this is REALLY loud.  The spout leaked, and the smoothie itself was not mixed well at all.  My cheap $15 blender from Wal-Mart was far superior to this piece of junk!  This was my first and last Villaware product"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,West Bend 58002 12-42 Cup Automatic Party Perk,"Coffee maker does the job and that's really all that needs to be said.  It's used every Sunday for our mid-morning break between church services, it's very dependable and clean-up is a snap."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,2.0,Wouldn't buy again,We are disappointed in this grinder.  The plastic cover has a ridge around the top that the coffee gets stuck in.  This prevents the grinder from working until you clean out the ridge.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,4.0,All Mixed Up,"Great machine!  And, it is gorgeous left out on the kitchen counter.  We put off buying one of these for years - that was a mistake"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,we use them all the time,"I never thought that I would prefer a food processor over a sharp knife, but here we are.  These discs all do exactly what they are supposed to, processing large volumes of food very promptly"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Beautiful Sea Mist Pitcher,"I decided to add this pitcher to my Sea Mist collection since Fiestaware is discontinuing the color (much to my dismay).  I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the pitcher is.  Sea Mist is much more beautiful in person, and so is the pitcher.  It not only matches my other Fiestaware pieces, but is an item that I can use in any room of the house.  I can see it displayed on the mantle, in a bedroom, the bathroom, as well as the kitchen.  If only Fiestaware would continue Sea Mist....I could order all the sizes of the pitcher and have a really nice display"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great mini bundt cakes,"I really enjoy the miniature bundt cakes this pan makes. They are great for parties. The pan itself is very durable, and the non-stick coating is great for the baking and cleaning"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"I use these everyday, multiple times per day","An avid home cook that is a collector of both cookbooks and cooking gadgets writes this review.  I have to say I love these tongs.  After purchasing the first pair, I found that I used them everyday and I bought a second pair. This product is now a must have in my kitchen.  I have summarized my observations of this product below:"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Excellent cookie press!!,"I received this press two nights ago and immediately made a batch of spritz cookies...they were the easiest, least frustrating spritz I have ever made!!  This cookie press works absolutely perfectly.  It is made entirely of plastic with a notched metal shaft.  Each press of the lever pushes the ""press"" down another notch, dispersing the precise amount of dough needed per cookie.  Clean-up is easy with warm soapy water.  It does not come with a recipe, but I used the Butter Snow Flakes from Allrecipes, and the dough was the perfect consistancy.  Again, wonderful cookie press.  Skip the Wiltons, the metal one and especially the battery-operated one, and get this instead.  You won't regret it!! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,I love Fiestaware ,"I got the turquoise 70-ounce casserole (with lid) as a gift for my sister in law and she loves it. We all love the Fiestaware dishes - they are beautiful and hold up well! We have yet to break one and whenever anyone brings a dish to the home, we joke about misplacing that one so that it stays there! It's a wonderful dish. I'd highly recommend any Fiestaware product."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,dinnerware,Item exactly as promised. Price was higher than local store that had same pattern but was no longer carrying item. Most items we order on internet ship within 48 hours so we thought a 7 to 10 day wait was a bit long
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,1.0,very dissapointed with this unit,I purchased this unit because of the high reviews that it has.  I was very disapointed.  It does not seem to clean nearly as well as units I have used in the past.  It left my carpet very wet and looking the same as the carpet did before cleaning.  The unit has a narrow cleaning path.  The tanks are cumbersom and not user friendly to refill.  
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,4.0,Great for young/college kitchen,"This is the first new pan I owned, given to me as a gift by a boyfriend who was sick of eating teflon out of my ragged hand-me-down pans.  Five years later, the pan has only minor blemishes, which do not interfere with the nonstick qualities, and trust me, I've abused it.  The only disappointment was that it did not like the dishwasher as well as I'd hoped. :"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,A few comments about cups and mugs...,"Back in 1970, when Corelle was first introduced (and Corning Packaging still made its boxes so that breakage during shipping would have been unheard of), the introductory sets included cups and saucers.  The cups were rather unique, because (1) they were actually made of Corelle, (2) they had what appeared to be half-handles, which (2a) allowed them to be stacked straight up, just like the rest of the dishes, and (3) were microwaveable.  To us engineers, it appeared to be a perfect cup, albeit a little small, but customer surveys seem to tell a different story:  people had problems holding the handle properly, resulting in reports of scalding, while others seemed to keep mistaking them for creamers or sugar bowls.  While this seemed silly to some of us (we found that they also made cute parfait cups), marketing decided that we needed to use real, full handles."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love Lock & Lock,"I ordered several different sizes of this product. We seem to have a problem in our household of getting zip lock bags to close, thereby ending up with chucks of rock hard ruined cheese and spoiled food.  These containers are easy for everyone to use, hold things like cheese without air drying them.  I use them for lunches, no leaks in the tote bag. We use two large ones for breads. The food can be seen through the containers and they stack nicely.  I'm delighted with them"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,5.0,The best knives you can buy,"It might seem like a lot to spend for a set of knives, especially with the infomercials that show people sawing bricks in half with their product, then micro cutting a tomato all for $19.95.  But this is a lifetime purchase.  The knives are balanced and have a great weight and feel in your hands.  A quick honing with the steel each use and they stay frighteningly sharp.  Like everything else, if you have the right tools, the job is infinitely easier, safer and more pleasurable.  I've had my set for over a year and they seem as new as the day they arrived.  One note of practicality is that I don't really need all the knives in the set and regularly use only four.  If really pressed or confined in a budget you could get along nicely with just two; the 8 inch cooks knife and the 3 1/2 inch paring knife, and of course a steel.  Don't be tempted to put them in the dish washer. They clean very easily with a soapy sponge.  Intense heat will change the steel in the blade and can be nicked and damaged.  Just a final note that Consumer reports rated Wusthof as the best in their tests as well.  There are several handle designs, but personally I like the Classic. The Culinar Premiere is beautiful and has all metal handles which are seemingly more durable.  But at twice the price  are for the very well heeled only. Highly recommended; you won't regret your purchase"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Suction? ,"I am very disappointed in this product.  I think it should be renamed the Dirt Devil Snail.  It has very little suction power, and the hole for the debris to go through is as equally little.  I bought this vac to sit next to the cat litter box, just to pick up the litter that dropped out, and it can't even do that.  It takes less time to walk down the hall, get the regular vacuum out of the closet, drag it back to the cat room, lift it over the child gate, plug it in, etc., than it does to use the Dirt Devil Snail cordless vacuum.  On that note, it is also difficult to replace it on the charger, it feels like it is going to break every time I try.  "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,Great idea whose time has not yet come,"I use silicone a lot -- thought this was the ideal replacement to twine (or dental floss). I'll stick with the floss. If you are using the loops on a piece of meat with any kind of fat -- pork loin or other, the grip is not there. wound up using them to tie a not -- then when I washed them after use, one broke in half. Keep working on it..."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Neat, sturdy and inexpensive","We wanted a sauce pan (with a lid) sufficient enough for our family and also to be useful when we have some visitors. So we considered this Faberware 3 quart stainless steel saucepan to be appropriate. We were a little doubtful about its steel handles getting hot while cooking. But after the first use this doubt vanished. We are happy with its material which is quite thick, weight and also simple design. It does not have any unwanted fancy attachments and obtrusive handles and the flat base gives stability and fits well on the stove."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,2.0,Dissapointed,"The thermotmeter failed the second tiem I used it, the pointing needle got stuck and it did not give a reading.  For ten bucks I would not go through the hassle of returning it so I disassemble it and unstuck the needle, but it got stuck again the next time I used it.  Definitly  not a good experience from such a simple product, which appeared to be very reliable, but wasn't"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent pans even better service,"My wife and I received the pans in this set for our wedding over 3 years ago.  They have been excellent despite very heavy use from us.  The non-stick still doesn't stick and there is almost no discoloration.  They are very easy to clean because the entire pan is non-stick, not just the inside.  The silicon on the handle does an excellent job of protecting your hand from being burnt even at high temperatures."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Nice blender,"It's very hard to find a nice dough blender and this one is really nice.  The grip is wonderful and it cuts down that pie crust making time in half. This is a real Godsend during the holidays when you're making all those cookies and cutting in the butter, as well as all your pies. My only complaint is that one of the tines bent a little but other than that, I have no problems with it and use it quite frequently.  I became quite weary of using a fork to cut in my dough and actually got lazy and tossed it all into my Kitchenaid mixer before I bought this blender.  It washes up beautifully in the dishwasher and is basically something EVERYONE needs to have in their kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"Nice shams, but color described incorrectly.","I ordered these shams because the description indicated that they were a ""subtle soft white stripe.""  That would have been perfect with my bedding, but the actual solid yellow-gold color doesn't work for me.  The shams seem to be a soft fabric with a high thread count, though the count is not indicated on the package.  I would be very happy with the shams if the color were as described"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,4.0,Great water not enough quantity,"This Brita Slim Pitcher is great for the price. The quality of the water can't get much better after running it through the filter. Size is the only constraint that this pitcher has. After filling 2 empty bottled waters (500mls) you have to wait and fill it up again. The time to fill up and filter is long, and to a person who likes to hydrate themselves, this can become tedious. This Brita Slim Pitcher can save you money on water."
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,stiff sheets,"good size, good color but way too stiff .I washed these 5 TIMES with no change"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Fabulous Fondue Pot!,"I received two of these fondue pots for Christmas.  They are wonderful.  We used one for Super Bowl to have a cheese fondue at the start of the game and a classic meat fondue at the end.  The temperature control worked perfectly for both and maintained the temperature well.  The cord is short, but fortunately I have a plug in just the right spot on the end of my kitchen counter.  I have a feeling they made the cord that way to try and avoid tripping incidents."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,KitchenAid Refurbished 5 Qt. Mixer in Empire Red,"I bought the refurbished model of this stand mixer in August 2005. I had heard a lot about KitchenAid mixers and I wanted to buy it for kneading dough for Indian rotis. It does a great job! The dough comes out as good as I could do it, except its a lot faster and ofcourse easier. For rotis, I use about 2 cups flour and approximately 1+1/4 cup water. The dough comes out better if you use water at room temperature rather than cold. I have tried breads too from the recipe book that came with this mixer and they turned out great! Love this machine"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,2.0,Don't immerse in water!,"I agree with the other posters about the balance issues, but I have a problem with the handles holding water and flowing out when it is turned right-side-up (my cookies got soaked!)Definitely keep looking."
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Whisper Quiet and powerful food processor,"For years now, I have had my eye on KitchenAid products, namely their prominent stand mixers.  So when the need for a GOOD food processor became a reality for me, I first looked at KitchenAid, and not much further.  In comparison to other professional-styled food processor, the KitchenAid has a solid feel, the base is weighted nicely and the components fit together very well.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Wonder-ful,"I had been wondering why no one had made something like this before and then the folks from Lodge did...It is perfect for making cheese sandwiches or really, any type of sandwich, as the bread fits in it perfectly...But what I wanted it for was, I make a mean sausage ,egg and cheese sandwich and was always flustered cause I could not get all of the egg on the bread without some hanging out all over....Well this little beauty changed all that for me cause when I make the eggs now in this pan, they fit the bread perfectly...I would recommend this pan to any one who does sandwiches or the like.."

kitchen & housewares,14 of 16,1.0,PLASTIC BLADE ASSEMBLY??????,Of course it cracked. Stupid design. What were they thinking. AND I can't seem to find a replacement part. WORST $60 spent. Get an oster
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love them!,I bought a similar one from W-S that was marketed as being for pancakes. Well the red one with the short handle is almost the same spatula.  Great for turning over pancakes.  The larger one with the longer handle is great for crepes.  They clean up beautifully in dishwasher.  Will probably buy more
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,4.0,Excellent for Home Use,"I bought these to use at home, where I cook 4-5 nights per week.  I have had my set for over a year now, and am very pleased with them.  All the knives have stayed so sharp that I did not need to sharpen them.  I like the versatility of having so many different knives and they look great in the block on my counter.  I am very pleased with my purchase!"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 24,1.0,Received wrong one THREE times,"I ordered the Pro 5 Plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times.  They kept sending the ""Commercial 5 mixer.""  In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods.  I have ordered many  ""cookie"" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer.  This has been going on since the beginning of December.  But no mixer!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Fantastic,This garlic press is the best!  You can press several cloves at a time without peeling.  Cleaning is a breeze.  I am as excited as a person can be about a garlic press
kitchen & housewares,24 of 26,5.0,A fantastic set!,"This is the best set I have seen so far.  The glass insert makes it easy and quick to change from oil to cheese or chocolate.  Clean up couldn't be easier because everything is dishwasher safe.  The review states that cheese fondue is best prepared on the stove and then poured into the glass insert, but I have melted it in the glass every time and it has always been perfect"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Lovely,"I love this pot its so roomy and solid. It has a good weight to it which I love, it keeps the heat constant and the cooking even. The only thing I don't like is that the knob get so hot, I have to keep a pot holder on it so no one gets burned again. That's the only thing I would change other than that its great and the Persimmon color is gorgeous"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Product,"I absolutely love this Dish. What I find the most appealing, besides the fact that it looks really nice, is that it is incredibly easy to clean. The food and stains will come right off with almost no effort. I definitely recommend it."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,TOB-165 Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven,I've had my TOB-165 Cuisinart Oven for a couple of months now and I really like it.  I use it for baking/roasting mostly.  It's a nice enough size and it does a nice job.  I have no problem using some of my bakeware in it.  
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,What should I say?,"If you already have the ice cream maker, this will allow you to make more in the same day.  I will say that occasionally it will come as a free bonus when you buy the ice cream maker, so look out for a good deal like that before you rush into purchasing this"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Forever Corelle ,"My mother had Corelle dishes about 25 years ago for a family of 9 and never a broken, cracked, or stained dish.  Fast forward to my own life and many sets of stoneware...I have happily returned to Corelle.  These are lovely dishes.  The colors are little more muted than in they appear in the picture but still very attractive.  Plus, they take about 1/3 of storage as my former set. I agree with the other reviewer, the bowls are shallow but I like that.  The coffee mugs are very nice but these are stoneware.  I bought 2 sets and am considering a third...I like them that much!!"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Worth the price without a doubt,"I have been using my current Circulon pots and pans for the last 11 years (possibly 13yrs - I cant remember). I just bought a new set cuz after 11+ years they just needed to be replaced. They have put in their time and performed admirably. I did have a problem with food sticking to one of the frying pans about a month or so after I got them so I called the compnay and they sent me a brand new one free of charge as per their warranty. I wash them by hand and also in the dishwasher (on the top shelf). I have found them to be strong and durable. They provided me with over a decade of even cooking, browning and non-stick service. Considering almost everything these days is disposable, or out of date a year after you purchase it, to find something that lasted 11+ years is a nice change"
kitchen & housewares,35 of 35,5.0,Great for stir-fry!,"I picked this one up at the local Macy's, for a little more than what Amazon is selling this for, and have been pleasantly surprised. This may look odd from the picture - it'll look even more so when you get it - but once you start stir frying in this, you'll see how much better this is compared to the regular pan."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,2.0,Lot different to the Actual photographs shown on site,I was really impressed by looking at the pictures but when i recieved the product it was totally different. The material looks different and it was a used product
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,4.0,Ease of use and cleaning,"Not only does my processor chop difficult items (e.g. baking chocolate) with ease, but it is wonderfully easy to dismantle, clean and reassemble.  It is also good looking on the counter, quieter than my previous machine and appears to have a more powerful motor"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"Really solid, well made, a joy to use","This pizza cutter will be the last one you'll ever need if you treat it well.  The design is deceptively simple - it's just a pizza cutter - right?  Well, I've used mine for pastry, pasta, and other doughs.  It screams through the thickess or thiness pizza crust - actually cutting the crust rather than just hacking at it like some less well made models.  My only warning - keep your fingers out of the way"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Highest recommendation.,"I've enjoyed mine for 15 years, my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years, not sure how old my grandma's is, all still run great. Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 10,5.0,Works Great!,So far we have only used one of the attachments and it works great.  We have used the shredder and it is perfect for making things like slaw..
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Great heavy lasagna pan,"This is a great looking 9x13 pan with good proportions.  It is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna.  It is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna.  Its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven, but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done.  I have made many other things in this pan with great results.  It is fairly non-stick and has not stained even after several lasagnas.  The enamel is fairly bulletproof.  "
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,Good enough for the money,"I think this oven is really pretty good for the price. It's quick and gets the job done. So far, I've got no complaints"

kitchen & housewares,14 of 17,1.0,Defective Control Master Heat Control,"I bought this frying pan as a gift for my Mother and had it shipped to California where she is taking care of my 99 year old grandfather. The packaging and papers were accidently thrown away. She tried to use the pan for a roast on Jan. 12th. and set the dial to 220 to roast slowly.  When she checked it in a short time, the water was boiling rapidly and could not be reduced to a simmer. No matter what setting, it just plain got scortching hot."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Thanksgiving Here I Come!,"Now, when I prepare collard greens for the family holiday gathering, I have a pot large enough to feed the entire family.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 5,5.0,Good sharpner!,It is a small and useful sharpener. Good features: Fast sharpen knifes; Easily stored; considerable price
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Not for ALL 5 Quart Stand Mixers - Make sure it fits yours!,"I bought this for my wife as a gift. We have a KG25H7X 5 Quart Professional HD Mixer, purchased (and probably only sold) at a major warehouse club where things generally don't Cost too much. Because it was summer and we weren't doing much baking, it sat in the cupboard for the better part of six months. When we finally did have a need for a second bowl, we were shocked to find that it didn't fit our particular model of mixer. It comes close, but it is obviously a slightly different diameter. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,"Good, not great..","Pros: moves a lot of air, cool retro look is appealing, nice low frequency sound for those that like the white noise of a fan while they sleep, modestly priced for a product with a lot of steel content. "

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Calphalon Contemporary Stainless 2 Quart Chef's Pan,"This pan caught my eye because it's so attractive and it had a great price.  The glass lid is a plus, too.  It's wondeful, I used it to cook rice the first time I used it and the water boiled so quickly, a fraction of the time it takes with the other pans we have.  Cleaning the pan was very simple, didn't have the use an SOS.  The only complaint I have is that the bottom was already discolored after one use with a blue-green pattern"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,4.0,fun and useful,"Even though we rarely use the &quot;dial-a-drink&quot; feature, it's a fun item and works quite well no matter what you're mixing.  (Lately I've been using it to whip cream for tiramisu. &lt;g&gt;)  My only complaint is that  it takes me forever to get the lid off, but maybe I'm just a wimp.  I agree  that it's big enough to mix three drinks at a whack, and the stainless  steel seems to be of decent quality"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product!,"This is a perfect way to spruce up plain old corn bread, by making it look like perfect ears of corn!  My kids love it and it looks very nice when serving guests.  I have one that was passed down to me and I am ordering this pre-seasoned one also because one pan is never enough!  I wish they offered a pan that cooked more at one time.  This is a great investment and works better than products that cost three times as much"

I called Euro-Pro and was told that I need to buy a new ""battery pack"" for $25.90 (cost+shipping).  I don't know how much this vac cost at purchase since it was a gift but I doubt it was much more than $29.00.  Anyway, I don't want this brand of product any more.  Also, years ago I had a dust buster (don't remember the brand but it was also a cordless vac), that lasted for at least 5 years.  I do not recommend this SHARK product at all!.  An"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,2.0,Horrible little thing!!!,"After much thought and research we decided to buy this particular iron. The first few months with it were alrite. The automatic stop went off every ten minutes after beeping for several annoying minutes. You then have to unplug the appliance for atleast a minute before you can turn it on and use it again. After six months, it started having problems with the steam generator. This after cleaning out the water after every use. THere were mineral deposits all over my clothes and I completely stopped ironing them unless required. Thank god most of my husbands shirts didn't need to be ironed always and I am a scientist...noone at the lab really cares if your top is well pressed or not. Its been a year and a half and the thing will not work with water in it. I need to have something else with which to sprinkle water on the clothes. To iron a single shirt now takes over 10 minutes. Do not bother getting this one. I am right now eyeing a rowenta. Will keep u updated on that purchase"

The battery cover was not made well and doesn't stay on.  I got a new battery, but I must say that after taping the thing together, it just makes me mad to look at it...

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Cool Kitchen Gadget!! ,"I purchased this product mainly for making soups.  I hated having to put soup into the blender in bathces to puree it.  Not only was this time consuming but I usually made a huge mess in the process.  Well this product solved that problem for me.  I made a soup the other day and used this product to blend the soup right in the pot!  While I was nervous about ""only"" being able to run the blender continuously for 50 seconds, I learned that 50 seconds is more than enough time for this item to blend a whole pot of soup, in fact it only took about 15-20 seconds.

These are the most fabulous little pans ever.. I baking cheesecakes using the water bath method.. I still wrap the bottom in foil, a little water bubbled in to the foil but they did not leak water into the cheesecake. My full size doesn't seal as tightly as these. It sometimes leaks even though I wrap in foil, which can cause the crust to become soggy... These little pan are also good for the left over batter when making a full size"

I had it for years, but I finally wore it out. I have searched the web for prices on the bags and Amazon had the best price..with the free shipping it is a non brainer. I have had two other brands of sealers and they were terrible. Nowhere near the suction power of the tilia. These bags are great..they seal well, and last for a long time. If you are not storing raw meat in them...you can wash them out and use them again and again. I particulary like it for cheese. You take what you need and then reseal the bag.

kitchen & housewares,22 of 22,5.0,So far so good...Smoke? read the manual,"I bought this crock pot despite the negative reviews. Several of them said the crock smoked and it was returned, only to find the new one smoked too.  Well, read the first page on the manual and it says in bold letters that it will smoke the first few uses.  I guess sort of like new brakes on a car (they stink! and it goes away and the brakes work like a charm). I liked the design of the crock, so I was willing to give it a try with low expectations.  So, I just filled mine with water and turned it on (before cooking a meal) to let it stink away. "
kitchen & housewares,33 of 34,5.0,No one does it better than this,"For a long time, I had a traditional alluminum pressure cooker that was given by my mother. It has the weight thing on top and when the pressure builds up, that thing is just bouncing up and down making all kinds of noise every few seconds. And alluminum is not good for cooking anyway. I looked at several choices including Kuhn Rikon and others that have stainless steel models. Then I chose this one over the Kuhn Rikon (the other final candidate) for the look, quality and easy to clean. It's much cleaner looking than others. The control is concealed and the lid is smooth all around. I was still surprised at how well it is made when I received it. The mirror finish does make it standout in our kitchen in a good way. It's easy to clean especially with that quick release handle. The helper handle is definitely a plus for less strong arms. We have cooked many meals with it and absolutely love it. Also, its rubber seal ring is much heavy duty then some other ones I looked, one less thing to worry I guess. It will take your cooking experience to another easy and joyable level"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Very Disappointed,"When my cookie sheet arrived, it had a product label glued on with some  sticky substance that was   all over it. Getting the glue off has been a nightmare. It was sorta like hard rubber but didn't want to come off the cookie sheet. I've used everything I can think of to remove it from the cookie sheet. It's now scarred from Brillo pads and various implements  to remove the glue. I guess somebody at the factory  must've had a bad day or something and decided to plaster the glue everywhere. I won't be ordering anything from this company again"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,5.0,"Great Knives, Try Them Out Before You Buy Though","I recently purchased the Wustof Classic set after much research between the various Wustof, Henkel and Messermeister models. In general, I felt the Wustof's had a much nicer feel and balance to them. I also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the Wustof. I personally prefer the Classic over the Grand Prix, but it is 100% personal preference as the only real difference is the handles. "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,Super soup mug!,"I love Fiestaware, and I enjoy the cobalt more than any other color.  These Jumbo Cups are lovely and match the rest of my cobalt Fiestaware completely.  They are large enough to hold a great amount of tea.  My only disappointment is that they come just shy of holding an entire standard can of soup.  If you do not remove about four tablespoons worth of soup before cooking in the microwave, the soup will spill.  If the cups had been just a little larger, I wouldn't have to worry about wasting soup.  Otherwise, they are fantastic"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,It's honestly the BEST can opener i've ever used!!!,"This is honestly the very best can opener i've ever used.  I""ve tried plenty of other ""safety"" can openers that claim they cut below the rim of the lid so that there are no sharp edges.  My problems with all these OTHER saftey can openers are as follows: (1) it's hard to line up the cutting wheel with the lid; (2) if/when you do line it up, the turning of the cutting wheel is difficult and labored; (3) you don't know when you've gone all the way around, since there's nothing to indicate you've passed the starting poing (in fact, i think with some of these other safety can openers, i'm re-cutting a whole new line into the can which doesn't line up with the old line b/c there's no guide to keep it perfectly even); and (4) it's nearly impossible to lift off the lid."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Lives up to the hype!,"Okay, to some the idea of using a French press coffee maker is a little too precious, bordering on snobbishness.   I used to be in that boat  until a few hours ago.  Tonight on a whim, I purchased this Bodum French press.  Now I should warn you readers that it is generally NOT a good idea to test out your shiny new french press when you are getting home at 10:30pm on a Monday after spending way too much money at Target when you just ran in to get ""dog food"".  I write this review so heavily caffienated that I will probably stay up until dawn tonight re-organizing my closets or alphabetizing my CD collection or doing some other useless task.  Despite being a daily  coffee drinker (of the muddy variety the office's Bunn machine churns out), one cup from the french press has knocked me into the stratosphere, and that alone is worth giving this product 5 stars."
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Dissapointed,"I bought this stockpot because the coating is supposed to make the aluminum non-reactive with foods that are acidic like tomato sauce.  The first time I used the pot was to make sauce with the tomatoes that I had spent all summer growing in my garden only to have the coating come right off the bottom and sides of the pot and leave me with a bitter tasting sauce.  Not only did the pot not work as advertised, but, it wasted a whole summer's worth of work in the garden, too.  Calphalon said that happens sometimes, but, that it isn't supposed to.  They will replace the pot if I pay to mail it back to them and write an explanation.  Save your money, time, and effort - buy something else instead"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Many years of Great Coffee with a Bunn!!!!!!,"This is our third Bunn. I had one that lasted over 7 years, I replaced it with a newer model we had for 6 years and have now replaced it with this one for the color scheme in our new home... nothing wrong with the old one, in fact I gave it to my in-laws and they are just as happy with it as we are. We make 1-2 pots of coffee a day and we are spoiled by the 3 minute wait for a hot cup of coffee. Bunn is a great company to deal with as well, we had lost the cleaning tool one time and I called to get a new one...they shipped one promptly free of charge no questions asked. As for he machine being ""on"" all the time, this is a misconception, the machine turns on and off when the water temp drops below the set temperature, so it is not constantly on...This is the best feature of the machine because if the power goes out you can still make a hot pot of coffee...So if you want a great fast cup of coffee from a quality machine by makers that stand behind their product...Bunn is the one for you!!!"

We like the clear glass cover so we can see it cooking through the glass.  It cooks fast if that is what you are looking for.  It has a temperature control, which works just fine for us.  It comes apart easily and VERY easy to clean.  It's the best indoor grille we've ever owned and we've tried a few of them.   Would we buy this again?  Oh yeah, in a heartbeat"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great for the Price!,"I love this machine!  Had it a couple months now and it's still working great.  Makes a good cup of espresso for the price.  The wand is usable, it just takes some experimenting to get the timing right.  I have no trouble getting a cup in place to froth milk.  It is sturdy and has a nice well put together look and feel to it.  It's very stylish, but takes up less room on the counter than my old drip machine."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,"If you can be EXTREMELY patient, you might get a slushie","O.K. Nobody out there could have been rooting for this little machine more than me. My husband bought this for me for Christmas (2005). I was thrilled...until we tried to use the thing. First of all, forget any of the recipies in the book. On that day we tried the very first one. All of a sudden, the machine started jumping around and making a loud clicking noise. We stopped it and looked and there was ice frozen all around the outside of the container. We melted that off and tried again. Same thing. Now, 4 months later, we have managed to get the machine to actually make slushies (within 30 minutes) only about 30% of the time. This machine will only make them with very high sugar solutions...even pop takes awhile. (We've been successful at using Kool-Aid with only about 3/4 as much water as it calls for.) The instructions say to keep adding ice/salt until it gets about an inch from the top. NO! We have found through trial and error that any ice/salt more than 1/2 way up the container will cause this finnicky machie to freeze up and stop. The slushies are of a good consistency when they actually work, but our whole family of 6 agrees that this is a better idea than actual product. Takes A LONG time and 32 oz of fluid will only make slushies for 1-2 people unless you give them out in tiny paper cups. Not good for parties, etc. like it says on the box. Kids would be crying all over. Also, the machine is VERY loud. Hard to have a conversation and you need to constantly check it and add tiny bits of ice. A real pain. The pour spout is nice, and it is easy to clean, but the frustration level is so high on this machine. Following their little instruction book to the letter just won't work. Like I said, everyone in our house has tried it, and it is just LOUD and FRUSTRATING...especially since when you crave a slushie, you CRAVE a slushie and want it then...not maybe, if you are lucky, in 30 minutes or so. Machine needs improvements...I'd spend my money on a better machine. Sad to say, but only 2 stars. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Good processor, heavy duty, but a little expensive","This processor has done a great job in the two months that we've had it.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Much better than the original blade,"I like this blade much better than the original slicing blade that came with my machine.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,bd,"Great value.  The knives are very sharp and easy to care for.  The various colored handles make it so easy to reach for the tool you need quickly.  Since the knives are stored in their own block on the counter, I find I reach for these tools rather than opening the untensil drawer and grabbing the tools I had previously used for years.  I generally like a clear, functional counterspace, however, these knives use such a small amount of space and are used several times daily.  The block is a neat and safe way to store them and keep them handy.  The overall design actually adds a little something to the space.  This was an easy fit.  We didn't have to get used to the new tools"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Love it!,"I needed a new blender and the price of this one was very good. Thought the little food processor might be nice to have too. Turns out I've used the processor nearly every day since I got it! I make fresh pesto, grate cheese, shred onions, good thing it's so easy to clean. The blender works great too, I like the ice crushing feature/setting to make summer drinks. I had a little trouble putting the processor together the first time, the instructions weren't very helpful and I didn't want to break anything by forcing it together. Found out it does take some firm pressure to seat it on the base. But after that first frustrating ten minutes I couldn't be happier with it"

LOL  I guess if you have padded carpeting then the bed would be fine but if you are planning on using this bed on hard surfaces then I don't recommend it. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"Tried and True, have used millions of times","I got one of these for a wedding present years ago, and it still is going strong.  I've used it too many times to count, perfect for boiling spaghetti in, or boiling potatoes in, soup, you name it.  It's one of those pots that go on and on and on forever.  A kitchen essential.  Always looks shiny and pretty"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Powerful Battery Operated Fan,Was pleasantly surprised at how powerful the fan was.  Would recommend it to everyone.  Especially those living in hurricane areas
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very nice cup and saucer,"I bought this when it was $18 and it was a good deal then. $13.99 is an incredible price for this.  It's very nice quality, has a very nice glaze.  There is a little scene also inside the teacup on the bottom.  Very nice"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,awesome,I can not express what a difference this steamer made for me! I've been wearing wrinkled clothes to work because I hate ironing that much. So when I had a little extra money I invested in a steamer. This one seemed like the best choice after reading all the reviews & I have to say I agree. 
kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,Love It!,"I've only had my Seal a Meal for a little over a week but I LOVE it!  I purchased mine because I wanted to try freezer cooking (cooking 30+ meals at a time and freezing them) and I wanted something that would protect my food better than a ziplock bag.  It works great!  Plus, you can use the sealing feature to seal any open bags including chip bags and most anything else.  This is wonderful!  No more chip clips!  You do have to be careful though.  When I first got mine I went crazy sealing all my open bags.  I tried sealing about 10 bags in 2 minutes and because of this, some of the bags towards the end started to melt a little.  You just need to give the machine a brief cooldown between each sealing and it works just fine!  The vacuum takes every ounce of air out of the bag which is great.  With that being said, if you are sealing a softer food that you don't want crushed, freeze it first!  Only rigid foods such as fresh vegetables, meat, etc can be vacuum sealed fresh as these hold their shape.  The value of this machine is unbeatable compared to other models out there including the foodsaver which is so expensive!  I got this particular machine for $49.99 plus free shipping AND it comes with the vacuum sealer, 2 11 inch rolls, 2 8 inch rolls, 10 quart bags, 10 gallon bags, 1 vacuum canister, and univeral sealing accessory (for the canisters and mason jars).  The price of the accessories alone would be close to $40 or more!  I have heard complaints that the vacuum canisters do not hold their vacuum.  I have not have this problem and LOVE these canisters for my vegetables.  Keeps them fresher much longer!  Overall great product for the price"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Buy this opener.,"I just got this in the mail this week and used it the first time this evening - WOW!  It works exactly as described - could not be any easier.  One suggestion - just be gentle and patient to get the opener started (you actually twist the knob toward you slowly until the opener ""grabs"" the can) and then you can crank away and off comes the lid."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Satisfied Customer,"After reading previous reviews on the product, I went ahead and ordered a Queen Set in white. Needless to say, I made the right decision. The sheets look great on the bed.  I'm so happy to find a set that actually fits our mattress.  The deep pockets are great. With the elastic all around, it sure makes for a good fit.  By following the washing and drying instructions, I felt it did cut down on some of the wrinkling.  I did not find the decorative edges to curl up.  For those who are a bit more fussy (which I intend to be at times)a touch of the iron is recommended, but really not necessary on the decorative edge. I definitely plan on getting another set in a different color."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,1.0,Difficult to Use,I bought three small ones of these for leftovers.  I've already thrown one out.  I can't get the tops off and I have no problems with my hands.  Not recommended
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Nice whisk,"This whisk has a very comfortable grip, as do all Oxo products, and it does a great job of putting air into the mixture.  It's light weight, but does a fine job"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,"Did the job, while it was working.","This thermometer does the job you can expect from a thermometer-it gives you the temperature whithin whatever you are cooking. If this thing was working I can't see any reason why not giving it a 5, but since mine broke after a few months (like previous reviewer)I can't give it more than 1 star. $20 doesn't seem to be much but for a small piece of electronics I think that you should get more for your money"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 10,5.0,Much better than other vacuum devices,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it!  It works much better and faster than standard vacuum devices.  A few quick pulls and you're done.  My husband was never patient enough to pump 15-20 times with the standard vacuum device.  He really likes this one because it only take 4-5 pumps.  He really enjoys using it and ACTUALLY uses it
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Light, small, and very easy to use",I bought this for my child to use at camp and while traveling.  It's so easy and convenient that she's also using it at home and has taken responsibility for being on time
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Mixer!,"Have been wanting one for along time, and then Amazon had such a great deal that I jumped on it ($309 - $25 plus free shipping and no tax!!).  I bought the nickel pearl 6 quart and it is awesome.  I have made mashed potatoes, bread and cakes in the last month and this thing has some major power.  Can't go wrong with this one.  I look at the Artisan 5 quart in the stores and it looks so little compared to this one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,horrible,"I wonder if I received the same items as the other reviewers. It seems clogged from the beginning, will not keep pressure, so does not work at all right out of the box. HORRIBL"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,What a great grill!,"I love this grill.  After careful research, I chose to purchase this grill because it seemed versatile with all of the different types of grilling plates it came with.  I was NOT disappointed--I have had no problems whatsoever with this grill.  In fact, this is the best grill I have ever owned.  I make paninis and waffles at least once a week and am always pleased with the results.  I look forward to trying other recipes down the road. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Nice alternative if your french press cools faster than you drink,Recommended as an alternative to a second container.  We tried this because our glass Bodum French Press sometimes cools faster than we drink our coffee.  This is a nice alternative to a second container like a thermal carafe or pump pot because you only need to clean one item.  The press function is not as smooth as a glass Bodum French Press but that's because you are using a stainless container and a rubber press.  This press is attractive and will last a long time
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Nice look but needs a fluted spout and is not rust-proof,"The good: this kettle looks very nice, and it's got a rubberized grip so you can pour immediately after taking the kettle off without having to worry about burning yourself."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,1.0,I wanted to like this...,"...really, I did.  I am a loyal Oxo customer and nearly everything in my kitchen is from either the Good Grips or the SteeL product line.  I was really excited to use this on the fresh herbs I grew in my garden...but it just flat out doesn't work.  It pains me to give an Oxo product only one star, but honestly, the thing is worthless.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.  Even apart from the fact that the blades do absolutely nothing, it's also extremely difficult to re-assemble it after you take it apart to clean it.  It's really just a big disappointment on multiple levels and it's currently taking up space in my drawer"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,Very sharp - only missing a sheath,VERY SHARP - do not touch the blade! I sliced a wafer of my skin. Wish it came with a sheath

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Spot lifter review,This product replaces one that I wore out using.  It is very useful for quick pickups from our pet messes
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,2.0,Disappointed with KitchenAid 4 1/2 Quart Mixer,Started using mixer in 2002...in Dec. 2004 had to take it in for service...all the oil had leaked out.  Was told I didn't use it enough!  Nearest authorized service center is 35 miles away.  I threw away a 30 year old GE mixer when I purchased this one...wish I had it back. (I must now order a new cover since the old one is stained on four sides by oil.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This is my second one...it's great.,"I got this for a Christmas gift 4 years ago. I've never had one that worked this well. I use it all the time...it just broke today, and I'm getting another one."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Unbelievable value.,"I've had this knife for nearly about a year, purchased at the same time as a name brand chef's knife, which cost 5x more.  I've used the Komachi much more often--twice daily, and it has kept its sharp edge much better than the other knife!  So I give this 5 stars for function and price.  It has become my favorite knife.  When it finally goes, I won't hesitate to buy another one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,My silpats are over 5 years old and are still going strong!,"I love this things!  I use them for baking everything from cookies to fish sticks without worrying about sticking.  They are still working beautifully after 5 years of serious use and abuse (I wash mine in the dishwasher, cut on them, store them all wadded up under pots and pans, use them under the broiler...etc.) I bake very delicate cookies and have never had an issue with sticking, and my baked products brown beautifully"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Easy to Use....Great Item,"I received my egg rings last week and have used them twice now.  So far I've got to say I think they're terrific.  I make my own McGriddles and Egg McMuffins...saving money on those ""quick"" drive thru runs.  The four rings attach to the handle making it easy to cook several items at one time.  I use the handle to remove the rings and set them aside to turnover the eggs or pancakes.  I'd recommend them...In fact..I'm ordering a set for my son whose the cook at his house"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Nordic Bundt Pan,TOOOO much fun!  Tip:  you don't have to flour on top of spray
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,No Kitchen is Complete Without These!,"I love these dishes!  The proportions, color vibrance, surface wearability and chip-resistance can't be beat for the price!  I suggest buying a few colors to mix and match, these dishes come in so many great colors!  If you're considering a lesser-priced set (I was), spend a little bit more, the extra quality and classic style are definitely worth it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,The grinder DOES make a difference,"I just switched from a blade grinder to this burr grinder and WOW, what a difference that alone can make in your coffee!  I was skeptical but since I was investing in a more expensive pressure espresso maker, I figured I better go all the way.  Well, my grinder got here first and so I decided to use it with my Mr. Coffee steam espresso maker.  I can't believe what a trememdous difference that made, I actually got nice thick espresso out with even a little bit of crema!  I couldn't believe it and can't wait to get my new Breville machine and have some really great espresso!  I highly recommend this grinder!!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Product,This is money well spent. We are very very satisfied with the performance of this unit. Though it is very expensive but it is really worth the money. It is very easy to handle and has a great suction power to it.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good sheets,"Bought these for the upstairs guest bedroom so haven't slept on them myself, but Uncle, who did, thought I did well"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,didn't get what I was told I would,"When I was ordering these items: 18 inchadjustable door rack, there was a buy 2 items which the other is the three tier can rack shelf, and take out the Amazon Visa credit card and receive $30.00 off the order so we did that in the end I NEVER got my discount I was charged full price I will be getting my card and, but no discount, realy sorry this is our 1st time and got taken by Amazon, E-Bay doesn't do that.  How sad !!!!!!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Space saving system!,"I really like the Smart Spin--we've used it in a house of three adults for the last month.  It is very compact for the amount of storage it gives.  The plastic isn't tupperware quality, but it is sufficient.  I don't feel comfortable carrying liquid in it (I pack a lunch and carry it in a backpack.).  It would be nice if they came out with something that allowed large flat things to be stored in it, but we still have our old plasticware.."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Did I ""Chip"" this right","Several commenters have expressed that you have to go easy on Sango because of chipping.  Well, I have owned my 8-piece setting and 5-piece completer set for 4 years and none of them are chipped!  As a matter of fact, they were stored away in boxes for 2 years when I temporarily relocated and was not using them. Perhaps the chipping is due to washing them in the dishwasher rather than by hand.  I used to always wash my dishes by hand and not until recently I began putting them in the dishwasher; still no chipping!  I am so happy with Sango, and the compliments from friends, that I am purchasing the 3-piece bowl set.  Sango really is a fine show and a great buy"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 12,1.0,Re: Arrived with largest bowl broken into fragments,"Do not recommend this item.  Paid 11.00 for shipping and handling.  Paid 15.99 for three bowls.  Very disappointed as there was no visible damage to the carton, and items seemed to be well packaged.  This sours me on Amazon.com"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 8,5.0,Hard to imagine how they could improve it,This is among the best of the OXO tools I've owned. It has exceptional sharpness and is a pleasure to use. Any serious cook who uses zest should strongly consider this tool
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Good Comfort,"The product is Wonderful. However, I am writing concerning the care of the comforter. The description online indicated the item was machine washable. However, the label has clean it professionally. I have small kids and it can be costly to have it clean professionally. Consider before making a purchase"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Outstanding knives!,"I put together a set of the Pro series for our anniversary , after reading reviews, etc & I think these will be a very welcome suprise.  The grips feel terrific & the steel top quality.  My wifes an outstanding cook so I doubt these will improve her but maybe she'll get some extra smiles from an old chore!"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Beautiful Colors,"Whether you choose to gather a rainbow of Fiestaware objects or stick to one color scheme, they all deserve to be on display. These plates are an ideal size for American-size dinners. Darker colors may show cutting marks after extended use, but other than that they wear very well. Now I understand why most of the women in my family are Fiestaware fanatics. It's all classic and beautiful! One tip: before you begin collecting Fiestaware, decide whether you're going to have one of each color, or multiples of four of each color. You'd hate to get halfway into collecting your set before you realize you'd prefer to have it another way"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,CORNING CREATIONS IS GREAT,"I REALLY ENJOY USING THIS BAKEWARE.  WHEN USED PROPERLY AND TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY, IT WILL LAST YOU FOR YEARS AND LOOK GOOD TOO.  CORNING HAS ALWAYS PRODUCED QUALITY PRODUCTS.  I STILL HAVE SOME OF THE PIECES THAT MY MOTHER USED BACK IN THE 60'S AND 70'S.  THANKS FOR OFFERING CORNING CREATIONS AT A GOOD PRICE.  AS ALWAYS, AMAZON ROCKS!!"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 18,5.0,Superb Purchase,"I purchased this slicer for my wife and I to use at home.  The unit is easy to use and a piece of cake to clean... and the price is right, too.  My wife is a chef, and she is extremely pleased with this unit"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,perfect fit,"I use this on my kitchen aid artisan mixer  and it is a perfect fit.  I can put all the attachements like the paddle, dough hook, whisk, and kitchen aid spatula for the mixer, and the cover on the mixer bowl and still be able to put this cover on it. Great way to protect mixer when not in use"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,A Superior Shot Glass!,"The double wall does its job holding in the heat, allowing you to take your time sipping.  It is nice looking and microwave safe in the event you want to preheat it or heat the contents.  My only suggestion is to have the dimensions changed so it is a little lower in height and correspondingly greater in diameter so it can be moved more easily under the espresso filter holder"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 10,1.0,Cruelty to Fish,"I am not worried about the fish getting too hot by the light or the bowl breaking.     What concerns me is the room.    It is a fallacy that they are happy in tiny spaces.    If you look a rice paddy in the dry season it may be very narrow but it is miles long!    I have actually seen pictures of this.    Sometimes they end up in a puddle, yes, but that is not the BEST time in their lives, its the worst!   Why put any pet in an environment that is typical of a bad time in its life?     Our job as pet owners is to recreate the BEST time in our pets' lives.      Please, PLEASE get them at least a ten gallon tank.     At the very minimum get them five gallons to swim in.     You will be surprised at how much happier your supposedly already happy fish is"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,George Foreman Grill,"Product is very good and serves the exact purpose I bought it for, i.e. grill upto 4 patties at a time. It grills 4 quater pounders or 3 half pound patties at a time. Cleaning is no hassle. I have even washed it under running water (ofcourse it wasn't plugged in) and you have to let it dry for a while after that. Advice - Don't trust the bun warmer; the transperant plastic cover just falls of and the buns don't get any warmer"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Good must have kitchen tool,"I like this measuring cup alot.  Comes in really handy to measure thicker consistency items such as mayo, honey, peanut butter, etc.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was that it can be difficult to adjust where you want to have it set when you have taken it apart for cleaning.  If you do a lot of baking, I would highly recommend to have this thing around the kitchen.  And yes, I was attracted to this originally because I am a ""Good Eats"" fan :"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,A Fair Deal,"it was a fair deal for the price I bought. I really like them as a good storage set. easy to clean, but the lids are said to be dishwasher safe. I dont agree with that. They should be hand washed with normal water. If they are washed using the dishwasher they wear out quickly, they loose the elastic behaviour. I am just planning to buy more and more of pyrex storage sets. I would highly recommend this product"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Perfect Small Sized Containers,I like the small size of the containers which allow you to store in your refrigerator without taking up too much space.  The covers fit securely so your foods are kept fresh longer.  Easy to take from refrigerator to micro-wave without having to find an appropriate micro-wave safe container as you do when using plastics.  I am very happy with the assortment of shapes in this grouping
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,1.0,Hole to small - Metal not plastic.,"Can't use this stuffer. First, there was a sharp lip on the stuffer and I could not get the casings over it. When I finally did I had a hard time slidding the casing up because the plastic surface was to rough. The hole size was also to small. In my opinion the part should be made out of metal, which is smother. I ended up using my old hand crank unit"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Big.  Round.  Expensive.  Heavy.  Wonderful.,"This massive, weighty, cast iron, ovenproof pot is a serious cook's dream. Though expensive, like all Le Creuset cookware, it's high value is proven by the stove-top and oven performance."
kitchen & housewares,26 of 29,4.0,works fine but the handle gets hot,This works great to flatten bacon.  I chose this instead of the larger circular one and it fits better in more of my pans.  The only question I have is why they didn't spend an extra 50 cents and put a wooden handle instead of a metal one which gets so hot one has to use an oven mitt just to pick up the press
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Bundt Pan,This pan will last forever regardless of how often it is used

kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,4.0,Packaging -- Apparently No Longer An Issue,"I ordered/received this cookware set in mid-April 2006.  The boxed set arrived inside a second brown shipping box -- there was no exterior indication as to the box's contents.  So, there now seems to be privacy when ordering this product.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,A surprisingly useful kitchen gadget,"I had my doubts, but after several STELLAR slow-cooker recipes I am totally sold, this thing is terrific! So far we've made a few chicken recipes and some barbecue sauce. Next we'll make ribs. And I want to get some beans soaking for tomorrow night. The reason I wanted a slow cooker was to make shredded beef for tacos, and this does a tremendous job!"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 12,5.0,Lodge Cast Iron Scrubber Brush,"Love it, Love it, Love it, very easy to use and great on my cast iron Pans.  I recommend! ="
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Great Garlic Press,"I strongly disagree with the other review; this is the most comfortable garlic press I've ever used, even compared to models by OXO. The handles are large and easy on the hands. Pressing cloves is very easy and requires little effort. The design is very intelligent (the package states it's a German design) - the press comes with two mesh stainless steel screens - one with larger holes and one with smaller holes. They are both removable, so cleanup is easy. The whole thing is solidly built out of stainless steel and has a good heft to it. Very happy with it, overall"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,A Must Have!,"This little pot can do a lot.  It is just the right size for cooking for 2-4 people.  I made about 20 stuffed grapeleaves that were cooked in water, tomato sauce and lemon juice and this little pot cooked them perfectly.  Cleanup was a snap with just soap and water without any hard scrubbing at all.  Don't fool yourself, this Le Creuset pot is a little workhorse...a must have for any kitchen!"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 2,5.0,Wine Saver,"The vacu vin wine saver works great, it keeps wine fresh in the refrigerator for weeks. Also it is very easy to use"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Works As Advertised,"This has been in steady use for about two years now with no troubles.  The metal where the handle and ring connect is thin, but so far ours has shown no signs of failure or fatigue.  It gets used regularly for fine straining applications (like mashing ginger, or straining the ""curd"" out of lemon or lime pie fillings) and has held up perfectly.  Aside from function, it also looks nice hanging from the ceiling rack"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Another fabulous Lodge product,"This is the 2nd and most recent addition to our rapidly-growing family Lodge inventory.  The size is excellent for our family of 5.  Between this and our 14"" deep camp Dutch Oven, I've almost decided to get rid of the RV oven!  I can't believe we've camped for 7 years without a Dutch Oven."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Ownership to Date review,"As I haven't been overly involved in the kitchen recently, my use of the hand blender has been limited.  However, I have been delighted with its performance as a stick blender and used it as a food processor yesterday.  It did that job with great aplomb and the clean-up has been easily accomplished. It's going to have to do something really nasty to fall from my graces.  I'm not holding my breath for that to happen"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,4.0,Great Sharpener for Home Cooks ,"     I have owned both the Chef's Choice 110 and 120 models and have found them overall to be the best practical tool for maintaining knives in good condition. For best results, follow the directions carefully. It is also easy to customize the knife edge for optimal performance by determining the amount of seration left on the edge."

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Substantial,"This ladle holds 6 oz, so it's nice and big.  The stainless makes it nice and weighty.  The long handle feels good in hand.  It's also beautiful enough to bring to the table.  Clean up is easy, hand wash or toss it in the dishwasher to make it sparkle"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Rich, Bright Glaze with Classic Lines",This is a wonderful bowl for a centerpiece and don't hesitate to also use it as a serving bowl. Fiestaware is famous for its excellent glazes and this piece does not disappoint. The cinnabar color is particularly nice to use around Christmas time. I also ordered the sauceboat w/platter to go along with this (although Amazon still hasn't shipped it) and plan on having a killer tablescape this Christmas
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Worth the money,"I purchased the Girmi Ice Cream maker last year and am VERY pleased with it.  It's quite easy to use.  Generally, the 1-quart capacity works well; for the occasional recipe that makes 1.5 quarts, I just adjust the ingredients.  I made some homemade lemon ice cream when my parents visited me and that evening my father ordered the same ice cream maker"
kitchen & housewares,32 of 32,1.0,Look elsewhere...,Like many of the reviews say - the broiler warped ridiculously on the first use
kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,5.0,attractive and handy,"I have two of these, one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color.  They're attractive, of course; this is Fiestaware, after all.  But they're darn functional.  They're long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs, and they're deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you're carrying or serving.  I like wish there was one slightly bigger too; then I'd get two more"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,This Is A Great Bargain!  Thanks Amazon!,"I've wanted a KitchenAid for years, but couldn't talk my thrifty self into the price of a new one.  (This same model sells new in our area for $308 incl. tax).  When I saw the offer on Amazon I couldn't pass it up. I actually saved over $200, plus the shipping was free. I placed the order on Mon. and the box arrived at ll:00 A.M. on Wed. Wow! Opening the box was like Christmas morning.  The mixer was very well packed in its original box. It looks and runs like brand new. The motor is not noisy at all, it purrs. So far I've made zucchini bread, loaded chocolate chip cookies, a double batch of pizza dough, and turkey meatballs...all handled with ease. I luv my new mixer!  If you're trying to make up your mind..grab this deal. You can't go wrong. "
kitchen & housewares,31 of 31,1.0,Don't be fooled into buying this....,"What a terrible quilt. I don't even think it deserves 1 star. The colors are dull and the border of the quilt doesn't even match the rest of the quilt. I could get better quality at a discount store. The worst thing is that even though Amazon allows you to ship back to them with only a label, what they don't tell you is the cost will be deducted from your refund. The picture was false advertising.....DO NOT BUY THIS!! I wish there had been reviews before I bought it"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,These things are fantastic!,"These this are great.  I ordered one, liked it so well, I bought another.  I use them to line baking sheets and to knead or roll out doughs (they have a bit more silicone on the bottom than silpat does, so they don't slide around on the counter and you don't have to spend extra for a second product, ""roul'pat"").  "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Review of Presto 23-qt Pressure Cooker/Canner,"I love this canner. My mother used to can everything from food to rocks and grass it seemed at the time. As a kid,I shelled more peas, snapped more beans and scraped more new potatoes than I ever thought necessary! Now I appreciate what she did and I'm trying to follow suit. This item was a total success. It was very easy to use and worked as advertised. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to bring the country back to their kitchen. Canned goods at the store might be easier but nothing tastes better on a cold winter day than the vegetables you put up yourself out of your own garden in the summer. The bonus to this was buying it online from Amazon, I got it cheaper than I could locally and it came quickly"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,The Iron Wok,"All things considered, the Lodge, Iron Wok, is everything I want in a useful, beautiful, durable, cooking tool. The perfict addition to our pro Garland range. This wok, ""wo(r)ks"" and hasn't left the burner, except for the quick hot water rinse, in the month or so we've had it. Why would we hide it? If I was stranded in our ""tropical desert home"" with only one pan/pot/skillet, this iron wok would more than foot the bill. Thank you for the oppertunity. Mark"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 14,4.0,Classic Style,"Fiestaware is timeless. Classic shape, classic colors, great quality. The finish is lead-free. The looks are from a bygone era but hold a charm that makes the transition to current styles. Great gift... can always be used. The only drawback I would say is the colors. Sometimes it is difficult to match colors to other brands of dishes you may already have"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,2.0,They broke after first use yet oxo hooked me up with new ones ,"I bought these because of their high amazon ratting. My tongs broke...The spring device used to open and close them is now jutting out off the handle and pokes you, and now they are unuseable..I contacted oxo and they sent me knew ones with ease."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,melitta mill and brew,"I have purchased two of these in the past and all i can say is outstanding product""""Its so easy to use and a timesaver.It grinds the coffee and then starts the brewing cycle.Coffee is excellent.Once you use this you will never buy ground coffee again""""The difference between ground coffee in  cans and beans is like night and day.The only thing i found is the latch on the lid where you put the beans in will eventually break if you just close it without holding the button in.All you need to remember is hold the button closed when you close it and then release the button.The latch will last longer if you do it that way.Even so my latch broke after a year of useing it without holding the button so i guess thats pretty good.Buy this product and i swear you will not be disapointed.Also,it doesnt need any filters"""
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Well Worth the cost,"I bought this pan just to make rice but since it's a tri-ply you can do so much more with it. brown meats, onions, garlic anything right in the pan which save you having to use a fry pan. The shallow size works out fine and even better for reducing sauces than the regular size 2 1/2 quart sauce pan. Well worth the the cost, so much you can call it a steal"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",I purchased this for my kids for a Christmas present. I think it is wonderful. It does NOT take two people to run the Arctic Twister unlike the reviews from others. It is easy to put together and easy to clean up. My whole family loves the ice cream that it makes. I guess maybe some of the unhappy people should just go to Dairy Queen..........   
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,4.0,good product,"Its a good blender. We bought it for preparing indian style mixes(dough/batter) and powders.  it serves almost all our purposes. Main difference compared with mixers is that its blades are orinted straight upwards, where as in indian mixers you have two sets at two different horizantal levels. because of its blades orientation it doesnt crush the batter with out lot of water. You can use it as a mixer cum grinder but only disadvantage is you have to dilute the dough/batter a lot"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Lovely and functional,Very useful and very beautiful.  Perfect for serving as well as cooking
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Nice mid sized saucepan,This pan is perfect for me because I am single and don't need to cook up 5 or 6 quarts of anything. It's well made and easy to store. I even bought a second one for potential bigger dinner situations or holiday entertaining
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Nice Set,"I purchased these for comercial use, hesitant about how they would hold up.  After 6 months of daily use through a comercial dish washer, they have far exceeded my expectations.  In fact, I'm back to purchase more"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 7,5.0,What is this thing?,My wife ordered this item and is quite pleased with it.I don't drink coffee so I examined it from the basis of functionality and quality of constuction.On both counts it meets or exceeds the manufacturer'e description.For anyone wanting to make a cup
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Couldn't be better,"Good solid construction.  Looks great.  Easy installation.  Perfect size.  Magnet perfect strength.  Just remember to put the back of the blade to the magnet first, then turn the knife flat onto the magnet.  Otherwise you'll mess up the knife blade"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Let the fiesta begin!,"I just started my Fiestaware collection and was very pleased with Amazon! The prices are unbeatable. My sets were delivered to me in perfect condition and in a timely manner! As for the product itself--I love it! The colors are much more vibrant than they appear on the computer screen! So far, I have Scarlet, Shamrock and Sunflower and I plan on adding to my collection soon"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,2.0,Could be more heat resistant,"Although I thought this product worked well in removing excess fat, it now has several long cracks in it and will have to be replaced in the very near future.  This is really annoying since I've only had it for a couple of months.  I plan on buying a [upgraded]glass separator"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 11,1.0,Do NOT be fooled--these are NOT made of silicone,"I ordered these cutting boards hoping to use them for my hot glue-gun crafting and other high-temperature applications, and was very dismayed when I received them.  These ""cutting boards"" are actually nothing more than flexible plastic sheets with a VERY light smathering of silicone dotting on the bottom.  You could not use these in the oven and they are not ""self-healing"" like many silicone-based mats.  In fact, the first time I used one for the simple act of slicing a cucumber, when I was done it had so many cuts to the surface that it ended up looking like the older, often-used flexible plastic cutting mats I've purchased at a dollar-store or large national discount merchant store for much, much less. It shouldn't have shown that kind of wear after just one use, which tells me the composition of the plastic is even below-average.   "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful measuring cups,This is a wonderful set of measuring cups and spoons.   Looks great in the kitchen and KitchenAid donates 10% of purchase price to breast cancer research

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,CORNING CREATIONS IS GREAT,"I REALLY ENJOY USING THIS BAKEWARE.  WHEN USED PROPERLY AND TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY, IT WILL LAST YOU FOR YEARS AND LOOK GOOD TOO.  CORNING HAS ALWAYS PRODUCED QUALITY PRODUCTS.  I STILL HAVE SOME OF THE PIECES THAT MY MOTHER USED BACK IN THE 60'S AND 70'S.  THANKS FOR OFFERING CORNING CREATIONS AT A GOOD PRICE.  AS ALWAYS, AMAZON ROCKS!!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless Cookware,This is one of the best cookware products I have ever used ... the flavor of your food is just that ... the food's flavor with whatever seasoning you have elected to use ... and clean-up is easy ...I would recommend this product to any one ...
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,One of my favorite purchases of the last year,"I concure with many of the previous reviews that this unit performs very well.  With a long battery life and incredible suction, I have found this Dustbuster far more useful than my old one.  It's ideally suited for typical home and garage cleanup.  Although the noise doesn't bother me (you definitely won't sneak up on anybody while running it), the ventral exhaust tends to scatter the whatever you're trying to vacuum.  I needed a little practice before I could avoid this issue"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,best ice cream scoop till the finish comes off,I also have had the ice cream scoop for around five years and noticed the finish comes off on your hands and ice cream.  It worked better than any other scoop but it worries me about the way it doesn't last. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,10-ounce mug,We have had a set of eight of these in Sea Mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years.  They will sit on Fiestaware saucers just fine.  
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Good Cookware for a Reasonable Price,"We recently bought this cookware to replace our teflon coated set that we received when we got married nine years ago.  After all the hype and scare about the dangers of teflon, we decided to go with stainless steel.  I bought this set mostly because it offered the most pieces for the money and the sizes of the pots and pans are great.  I am also really happy with the look of the Farberware cookware, although the inside of the pots don't stay new and perfect forever.  I really like the handles.  The soft touch handle is very comfortable and easy to hold. I had to get used to using stainless steel after having the non-stick coating all those years.  You definately don't have to use very high heat when cooking because is heats up fast and can burn the food especially when frying.  With a little non-stick cooking spray before use, and some immediate soaking after the cooking is done, this cookware cleans up nicely and remains shiny new on the outside.  Overall, I am very happy with this set.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Small kitchen,"The most compact unit I could find.  Stainless steel looks great on my small counter top.  It heats up very quickly, cutting down on cooking time.  The only thing I don't like is the timer which counts down in five minute increments, making it hard to know when to start cooking something else"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Deal and Well Worth it .,Wow what a great price and comfortable.Yes they pile after washing but hey their cotton and I also expected it .They are soft not rough feeling compared to some sets I paid alot more for.I own 2 sets now and plan to continue to save money and order more for the rest of my family.
kitchen & housewares,21 of 22,5.0,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME,The money tree arrived today on time. It was a gift to me :) I opened the box and couldn't believe how perfect this tree was. I'm going to have to purchase some more of these soon. Especially for the holidays. The roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree. Thanks
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Very unhappy with the product,The comforter is uncomfortable and unsoft. The bedskirt is made of some cheap material between clothes and paper -- very easily to be broken. The original price is so misleading. I think it doesn't worth $30
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Lots of uses,"I use my flipper in the kitchen all the time. It's really nice when breading meats,with flour,then egg and bread crunbs. Your hands don't get a mess and it don't clog up like tongs do. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,4.0,Great !!!,"I bought this oven, thinking it was more like a slow-cooker; but it's definitely not slow!  We cooked a roast w/carrots, onions and potatoes for a family dinner the other night and WOW!  Clean-up was easy too!  The only downside to this oven was that when I opened the box, there was a small nick and scratch inside the cooker part (not the teflon);but this hasn't affected the performance at all.  Infact, my parents want one for themselves"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Perfect for french onion soup!,"I only bought 2 and now wish I'd purchased 8. They are heavy and appear very durable. The lid is fairly thick and has a tight seal, actually much better than expected. Wait for them to reappear on the Friday sale and save a couple of bucks. I assure you you won't be disappointed"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Light, modern, elegant","I just bought this set and love it.  The pieces feel light in the hand, yet substantial.  I'm not sure what the reviewers who had their knives separate are talking about -- the knives in this set are one piece, not two, so either Oneida improved the design or those reviewers are actually talking about a different set.  This silverware is easy to take care of, but FYI, you definitely have to hand dry them to avoid spots"
kitchen & housewares,29 of 30,5.0,The Best Pans,"You will not regret buying these pans.  That is if you buy them at a store that will let you swap out pieces.  The 3qt saute is too small, go for the 4qt.  Or just get whatever suits you best."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Buy this- you'll love it!,  This thing is just fantastic! Nothing scrambles eggs or pushes cake batter like it.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Works Great,First time I used the Roomba I was embarrassed at how much dust was on my floor. I had to run it 3 times to clean my small carpeted studio.
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,dissapointed,loved it from the start...but now the little wires that support the bread and go up and down have bent and are jamming. It's less than a year old...this just should not be happening with a quality product. I won't do this again
kitchen & housewares,19 of 20,5.0,Just love it!,"I saw that my favorite cooks on FoodTV were using a Santoku knife just like this one so I added it to my Christmas Wish List.  All the articles I read said to get a hi-carbon knife like this.  I didn't feel like spending $90+ for just one knife.  So, this Calphalon is a great value!  I love it.  I didn't realize what a difference it would make.  Just a great knife.  Wish the handle were a bit bigger, but no other design flaws"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Simply the best salad spinner out there!,"It's so great, I bought a second one for our weekend house"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,amazing,"I would highly recommend these mixing bowls, they are amazing! Having grown up with my mothers old bulky metal mixing bowls it was so nice to receive a set of these for a wedding gift. They stack very neatly inside of each other and are so easy to use with the pour spout, I use them on a daily basis!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Circulon Rules,"We like everything is their product line. Good heat distribution, great non-stick finish, nice design, metal and glass tops are a nice feature"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Best tea pot ever!,This pot is so wonderful. It holds more than any other teapot I've seen and it stays hot so much longer than a normal teapot--even without a cozy! It's easy to clean and makes an excellent pot of tea! Been using it for two years now
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Cake Plate/Punch Bowl,"I was looking for a simple cake plate and found a great cake plate with a bonus: a great punch bowl, too.  The look is elegant.  The quality is exceptional, especially for the price.  You won't be disappointed.  I love it"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,very nice,Looks exactly like the picture.  Very comfortable.  The sheets could be of better quality but no complaints for the price.  I have been using the product for 6 months now
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Great sheets for short period of time...,These sheets were the softest sheets I've ever slept in... until after a few washings the fitted sheet became pilled. I'd prefer a regular sheet to these now. I don't recommend buying them unless you only need them for a month or two... and that would be odd
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great Rice Cooker,This is my first rice cooker.  I spent a lot of time searching for an affordable rice cooker that could get the job done.  I have found that this cooker meets my needs perfectly.  
kitchen & housewares,5 of 11,1.0,Defective product,"The infuser came broken, inside a perfectly fine cup with lid (no shipping to blame). Please stay away of this item, unless you can purchase it in a store and can check it beforehand."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Big mouth processor is the best,"This is a workhorse.I have prepared almost the whole Thanksgiving meal using this from making all my pie crusts to chopping veggies.You can do egg whites,whipped toppings not to mention the whole vegetable slicing.The huge capacity bowl allowed me to mix up 2 pumpkin pies at once.Cant be without it"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Fantastic product,"When I lived in CA we had very hard water. I purchased a fairly expensive two-stage filtration system that mounted under the sink thinking this would be the greatest tasting water ever. I was wrong. The water still had a metallic taste. When I tried a Brita Pitcher I was extremely impressed. They are the only company that uses silver oxide pellets in the filter, which act as a water softener and work well with hard CA water. I've since moved to GA where the water is much softer, but these filters make such a noticable difference it is incredible. If you change the filter every 5 weeks or so you will be very happy with the results. I've been using the same pitcher for about 7 years now and it is still in great shape"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great looking kettle that's practical too,"I've had this kettle for about a month now and I'm making tea WAY more often than I used to.  :)  The handle does get hot, so you need a pot-holder, but other than that it is pretty much perfect for practical use.  The long spout makes pouring easy.  The hinged handle and the way the lid is constructed makes it easy to open to put in the tea, stir in some milk, etc.  Plus, it looks nice so you can serve with it for casual entertaining, as opposed to having to pour the tea from a kettle into a teapot to serve.  It comfortably makes 4 mugs of tea or 6 smaller tea-cups of tea"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very Good Slushies,"This is only the first time using. I had a very good experience. Very easy to use. Filled it and timed it for 15 minutes. I used Ice Cubes, not crushed, coarse salt, not table salt, as stated above. Made delicious slushies. Does not make enough for parties. Makes only 3 or 4 slushies per batch. For my family, it works out fine. It did make some unusual noises, so I will be looking for those mention problems. Like I said, I only used this once."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Don't waste your money on this piece of JUNK!!!,"The steam cleaner I bought was a reconditioned unit off of E-BAY.  I paid $100.00 for it.  The brushes never worked, but it still cleaned the carpet o.k.  I emptied the bottom tank full of dirty water, rinsed it out and put it back on.  Then I refilled the hot water tank, and added more cleaner to the detergent compartment.  I turned it back on....true to what other's have stated, the upper tank started to leak, not badly but it's not supposed to do that.  Then without warning, the unit started to smell like it was burning....it seems the motor decided to take a DUMP!!!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love this pan!,"I absolutely love this pan. There is no problem with food sticking to the pan because it is such a high quality product. It is 200% better than any non-stick pan that always seems to get scratched and peels. The only thing is, I wish it was a 14 inch pan instead of 12 inch - but regardless, I use it for everything and love it. I will continue to buy All-clad pans in the future"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Elegant & Easy Clean Up,"Very large capacity no stick skillet makes cleaning a breeze!  The DESIGN is very elegant and easily held a whole chicken, cut in half with potatoes, carrots & onions!  Even though the skillet is non-removable, it's still elegant enough to bring to the table.  I'm impressed.  You COULD spend more, but WHY?"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Wok and Roll!!!,I received this yesterday.  They are very sturdy and well made.  I used one piece to stir fry last night and was very pleased.  It also cleaned up easy.  I am very impressed with the weight and quality of each piece.  This particular set (in a clear plastic box) is treated wood.  The price is very much worth what you get.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 12,1.0,broken item,I was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and I needed to send it back for a refund
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Worked great for us!,"We have four dogs, and they're pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking. One of our neighbors ""strongly suggested"" this product as a possible remedy. I did some investigation before purchasing, including talking to the manufacturer. Their sense was that it works for about 50% of dogs, which is in line with what I saw in other on-line reviews at the time (this was about a year and a half ago)."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great,"I have become increasingly fond of glass items in the kitchen.  I have purchased glass lids for many of my pots, etc.  I prefer to see what is happening during mixing and cooking.  Current glass, including Pyrex, is very durable; I have never broken a piece."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,"Never worked well, then fell to pieces","I was very disappointed with this product.  Despite following the directions precisely, the iron never steamed at all.  It did work for dry ironing.  Then a few months later I was packing it for another trip, and found that as I attempted to slip the soleplate cover on just to see if perhaps NOW the steam part would work, it broke into 3 pieces.  I would certainly not purchase this product again"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,An excellent item,"I purchased this item in a four piece set from HSN.com and unfortunately they sold out.  So here I am looking for more.  This is the best utensil we own in our kitchen.  I read the other review and I just have to say that this is a very heavy turner that is able to stir and flip over anything that we have used it on.  For instance when we make a huge pan full of fried rice this is what we now reach for to turn the rice.  Barely anything sticks to the turner and it has the weight to perform the job.  Best of all, it hasn't melted at all not like our cheaper nylon tools.  I would recommend this to anyone"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Wish we would have bought one sooner!,"We have used this rice cooker everyday for the past 5 months, and we absolutely love it!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Product,"This is a great storage set.  The lid is snug, but you get used to it after using it a couple of times.  It doesn't stain at all.  Perfect to use in the microwave and to store food"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 11,1.0,Cuisinart Genuine Replacement Food Processor Blade & Disc Holder # BDH-2,"The product description and item's picture are very misleading.  It appears that you are buying replacement blades (clearly shown in the item's picture) and the blade holder, when in fact it is just the blade holder. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love the glasses,I am thinking about picking up more of these glasses - I love them - love the design! They are absolutely beautiful.
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Clean carpets, but leaky with upholstery attachments.","The Hoover F5914-900 is my first steam cleaner. It got my carpets cleaner than the model I rented from Giant, and even got out some spots that had been in the carpet for years. I did have problems when I tried to use the attachments. Water leaked out under the steam cleaner while the attachments were connected - might be user error. I will have to look for better hook-up instructions"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Pie Plate Image Misleading,"The pie plates are a good value.  However, the picture of the pie plates does not show them as they are.  It shows pie plates with handles and a steeper side.  These pie plates with the handles hold more filling than the pie plates which I received.  I was,therefore, disappointed since I expected the pie plates which were pictured"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,works great never had a problem,"I have cooked maybe 5 cups max so far works great, never burned, and never under done. no foam, and clean up is easy. I always put a little extra water and have used noodles and broth. never had a problem. don't recommend for personal serving, but for two of us its great."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,The BEST!,These are probably the best sheets we have ever slept on in my life. The color is beautiful.
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Amazing!,"This blender is incredible. Expensive, but well worth it. It can blend anything in 20 seconds or less. Ice, frozen fruit, you name it. It has a great modern look with the stainless-steel jar and after use just throw it in the dishwasher. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Oh happy day!,"My family loves old fashioned, real milk shakes. This product works like a dream and I made a perfect milk shake on the first attempt. It is sort of big and I was trying to find a place to store it in my kitchen and my family laughed. Keep it on the counter, they said, it won't be worth your time to put it away! It is worth every penny!!"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Great bowl for teenagers,"This is the best bowl for teenager portions of cereal, ice cream or spaghetti. They also make good fruit or candy bowls to set on your counter. I do want to warn people that the photos colors for persimmon are too light on this website; the actual bowls are a medium red/orange. I knew this before I ordered it... You can't beat the price free with a four piece setting. We love it"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great Blender,"Though definitely a high price point, this blender is industrial and absolutely will blend anything. Fast, sharp blades cut through ice and anything else we have thrown at it with ease. Great buy, worth every cent"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,Cracked!!,"We bought one for Christmas and love the food sealer.  However, all the canisters have cracked.  So far, still holding the seal, but they are getting progressively worse, so it's just a matter of time.  These aren't exactly cheap, so I think it's safe to say that we should expect bettter"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,"Although Imperfect, This Handy Tool is the Best Out There","This `splash guard' has been appropriately named ""Pouring Shield."" Flour will still pouf up a bit when added while the beater is running but the mess is greatly lessened and kept off of you. I wouldn't run the mixer without it. You'll have to toss a bit of flour onto your face yourself so your family will know all the `hard work' you've been up to in the kitchen. "
kitchen & housewares,21 of 22,5.0,Great food mill,We replaced our aluminum food mill with this stainless steel one and really like it. We've canned tomato juice and applesauce using this food mill and it did a great job of preventing the seeds from getting through. The stainless steel also prevents the discoloration to the applesauce that the aluminum food mill caused
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Becoming more popular!,"The problem I have with a typical meat pounder is that it breaks through the wax paper. This pounder is flat and you can put chicken breast between wax paper and pound them flat without a big mess. There are very expensive pounders out there costing over forty dollars, so this is very reasonable. The weight of the pounder helps you do most of the work. This is also called a &quot;battitore de carne.&quot"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Works well.  Worth the money,"I was thinking about purchasing one of these ionic purifiers for a while, since I saw it in sharper image.  But as I knew the technology behind it, I knew that sharper image was just gouging customers by charing $300 for a unit.  Then finally at costco or frys (i don't remember), I picked up the ionic pro (about 2 years ago) and since then it worked well.  I dind't deal with their support.  So I coud not tell how good or bad they are.  But the product is good for the price.  It eliminates the musty smell in the room with ions, and gives the fresh feeling. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,"excellent product, highly recommend",I absolutely love these potholders!!!! I have four sets of them. They are great as potholders but they also have other uses. I place them under cutting boards to keep them from sliding on the counter when I am chopping. I also use them to keep bowls firmly on the counter if I am whipping cream. I also use them as trivets when placing hot pans on my counter top. 
kitchen & housewares,15 of 18,5.0,I'm sold,"I thought I wanted a regular 4 slice toaster but my husband convinced me to try this toaster oven.  So far it is great!  I wasn't able to fit six slices of bread but 4 fit with plenty of room.  It heats fast and cooks well.  Toast was a breeze, our four kids are very excited about cooking their favorite breakfast items in a different way"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,4.0,works great,"I have only had this vacuum for 2 1/2 months, but so far it works great.  I have 3 kids, a cat, and a very large long haired dog. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,5.0,Right up there with the wheel and the mousetrap!,"the bean vac is so cool - we have several and use them for everything in the kitchen where preserving freshness is a priority - have used constantly for a month and no problems whatsoever - perhaps mr husson is doing something wrong, or just got a defective one that was damaged in shipping - i'm sure sharper image would replace it with a new one if he asked - it would be foolish to give up on such a wonderful product - everyone on my christmas list is getting one this year"
kitchen & housewares,28 of 28,5.0,A misunderstood tool. Buy It.,"This excellent food mill made of heavy stainless steel does NOT do the same job as either a food processor, blender, or grater. The one tool to which it is most similar is the potato ricer, which I choose when I am cooking for only two, but the food mill is much better when there are four our more diners for which to make truly lump free mashed potatles."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,beautiful,"Beautiful bowls.  Cobalt blue on the outside, french white on the inside.  These bowls are very heavy, a sign of durability.  These bowls are going to last a long time and I plan on ordering more"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,"An excellent lime juicer, but mediocre for lemons.","I've used a large variety of tools over the years to juice citrus, and I was excited when I learned of this tool.  Not only is it by Oxo, a leader in kitchen gadget innovations, but Cooks Illustrated also rated it as the top method for juicing limes."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice hot coffee,"I love this coffee pot however, it only lasts a few years and you have to buy a new one mine just died again"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,cuisinart failure,"I purchased this item with great expectations.  It was defective, or maybe toast is supposed to brown on an intermittant basis.  Also, it is too small.  They say you can put up to 6 slices of toast in the oven, but it is IMPOSSIBLE.  Frozen pizza would also not fit.  All in all, this product is NOT worth the expense"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Exactly what I wanted,"I just used this iron for the first time, and I love it.  Ironing goes much quicker without a cord."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Perfect glasses,"My new glasses arrived this week and they are perfect.  Size, quality, design, look and feel in the hand are all perfect.  They have an antique jar look about them but are also simple, sleek and modern"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Use them often, haven't noticed melting","These tongs are fantastic.  We use them all the time on the barbeque and have never noticed melting of the tips, as another reviewer mentioned.  They easily pick up small and large objects.  I like the pull tab locking mechanism, and show me a pair of tongs that doesn't take two hands to close and lock.  This product is well designed, and I would buy it again"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Pass on this set...,"The box was crushed inside an Amazon box and taped back together.  The handles are hollow, therefore impossible to really clean.  The handles heat up immediately so you need a pot holder.  The metal is very thin and light.  I saw better product at Target with less pieces for the money and much higher quality.  I'm very disappointed.  The picture of the product is very misleading (especially the handles).  Quality is poor.  I'd send it back but too much red tape with Amazon return policy, so not worth it.  DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 32,2.0,This grinder has problems,I purchased the La Pavoni Burr Grinder summer 2005.  After some 7 months of grinding once a day for one serving - it stopped working.  In addition to its short life span it frequently would grind coffee beans and wouldn't stop grinding until I pulled the cord from the wall. This resulted in an overflow from the ground bean container.  The setting to control the type of grind stopped working several months ago resulting in finely ground beans all the time.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Beautiful!,"I have always wanted this collection from Corelle. Finally, received a grst bargain on it. Received it in only 2 days!. WTG!!!!!! Thanks Amazon"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Thermos!,My husband had a Thermos his Dad had used for years. When it broke he was heartbroken. One of the items I purchased for his birthday was this Nissan Thermos. I read your other reviews and thought this might be a good fit.
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,4.0,The Don,"It's important to note that ice cream makers aren't really convenience products. It takes a little bit of time, patience, and kitchen handiness to produce homemade frozen desserts. Not that it's difficult, but if you're only looking for convenience, you are better off just buying ice cream at your local mega-mart. If you are not the type of person who gains personal satisfaction from preparing food by hand, then I wouldn't recommend one of these appliances."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,Not very robust,I have placed an order for this scale because others feedback here. First came giving me an overload reading after turned on even without load on glass table. Replacement has the same problem even worse. One corner was missing the support. It does not look very robust
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent,This is a great little stockpot.  As mentioned earlier it's a very stable pot.  I have a glass cooktop and only very flat bottom pans are usable and this one works very well. I don't like non-stick pans and stainless are a lifetime investment so this is an excellent pot for an excellent price
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Plates are RED hot!,They are strong and sturdy.  Much better than the typical Corelle plates.  Loved them the first time I saw them.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Unbelievable Kitchen Tool!,"The electric can opener....which screwed cans up more often than not anyway...now goes to the trash heap.  This Oxo opener is fantastic.  I can't even believe I'm writing a review on a can opener of all things, but this thing is just amazing.  Works effortlessly and with no mess at all.  Forget electric: this is the way to go!!"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,does what it's supposed to,"Does what it's supposed to.  Things get very cold very fast and generally doesn't fall apart.  I did have one spill, but I didn't close it very tightly so probably my fault.  This is a good basic shaker"
kitchen & housewares,56 of 60,5.0,"Heavy, Well Built, Great Pizza Crust","I bought two of these, despite their relatively high price.  I wanted to be able to cook two large pizzas at once for entertaining, so nobody waits slobbering while others eat their pizza."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,This is a great tartlett pan,This pan is the only way I can make tarts without them sticking to the pan.  I have tried every other pan known to mankind and this is the best.  It's sturdy and very non-stick.  I highly recommend it.  Tarts come out looking professionally made
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,2.0,"If you like burnt toast, this is for you","Personally, I don't like burnt toast and hate this toaster.  I thought buying a Cuisinart toaster would insure a lasting appliance.  I may as well have spent $10 at a discout store.  I have had this toaster for a bit over 3 years.  We don't toast often, but for the last year I have been tolerant of popping up the toast half-way through to see if it is ready as if I wait for the machine despite any setting it will burn.  Very disappointing for an appliance that is supposed to have a good reputation.  Two starts as it did work fine for 2 years. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Not so soft,I bought the 1200 ct sheets because I wanted an ultra-soft sheet but was disappointed.  The sheets are extremely heavy and will no doubt wear for years but they are not soft ... even after several washings.  I should have returned them immediately but kept thinking that one more washing would soften them up .... wrong
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,These Are Excellent and Air Tight,"I'm a little puzzled by the review stating that these containers don't nest and that the lids are hard to remove.  I'm very demanding about kitchen equipment, and well, they nest and the lids are not hard to remove.  I could care less about the little vents that allow you to re-heat stuff in the microwave.  Probably works fine, but I don't use that feature."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,BEWARE!  This is not the big (30 lb.) size--it's tiny,"The heading for this item says ""holds 30+ pounds.""  However, the dimensions on this version are very small, and it's described as being perfect as a travel container.  I agree, the big version is fantastic.  I wish it were sold here--and that Amazon were more careful about reviewing the way products are adverstised and described"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best travel mug I've owned,"If you want a travel mug that you can fill with piping hot coffee in the morning, throw it into your bag (yes it really, really won't leak) and have hot coffee hours later, than this is the one. I have owned many... this is the only one I have bought as gifts again and again"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,The best coffee pot in town!,"I love this coffee pot.  I have fresh brewed coffee in 3 minutes!  For someone who's motto is ""there is no life before coffee"", this is the perfect machine for me.  You just have to remember if you don't make a pot for a few days (heaven forbid!) to pour a pot of water thru the machine so that the evaporated water will be replaced to make sure you get a full pot.  If your looking for a great cup of coffee in no time, this is the machine for you.  Enjoy"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best knife I have ever owned,"This is the best and most useful knife I have ever owned. My hands are small and I delight at a nice well balanced untensil such as this one. Excellent, everyone needs one of these if they spend any time in the kitchen !!!!!!!!!!!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Love it!,"The good reviews here are correct. I bought this thing on a whim about six months ago and at first I wasn't really sure what I would use it for since I already have various measuring cups, spoons, etc. I find myself using it constantly though. What's nice about it is you have a lot of different measurements in one place. Plus I've found it to be very accurate. It measures CUPS, OZ, TBSP, TSP, ML/CCM/, and PINT. I do wish it were glass instead of plastic. And yes, like others have said the cupped shape on the bottom sometimes get's dishwasher water in it, but that's not a big deal to me. I think it's a very reasonably priced item that is really handy to have if you like to cook and especially if you like to bake"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 16,1.0,"The Incubus, or, How a Litterbox Ruined My Life","This is possibly the worst product ever fashioned by human hands. When it does work, which is rarer than the appearance of most astronomical phenomenon, all the tines of the rake serve to do is spear chunks of cat feces and carry them back to the return position, leaving nothing in the waste receptacle. Spending just five minutes scraping it off is enough to make me want to stab myself with one of said tines, that I might become infected with a deadly strain of ecoli, and be permanently freed from this abortion of a product. Please, spend your money elsewhere, and if you already own one, do humanity a favor and destroy it, preferably by incineration"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,The best non-stick pans out there!,"I've purchased and tried them all, and these beat everyone of the nonstick pans out there.  They are heavy duty, never warping under the direct heat of the broiler, and clean up in a breeze with a little soap and water.  I cooked everything on them from steak to cookies and everything cooks perfectly.  The best part about them is that even though they are dark, cookies don't burn on the bottom like they do with most dark pans.  They will probably last a life time.  I like them so much, I started buying them as gifts"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,1.0,Metal doesn't match,"I recently purchased a stainless steel Calphalon Pot Rack.  I needed a couple of extra hooks, so I purchased these, since they are made by Calphalon and they look like the stainless steel hooks which came with the rack.  Wrong! They look almost the same, but the disappointing part is they are made of aluminum instead of stainless steel.  They look terrible on a rack where every component is polished stainless except for these two hooks??"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"shiney, hefty and sturdy !","I love my All-Clad pan.  I used it to make lasagna as well as heating up chicken nuggets or fish sticks.  Very shiney and expensive looking...will not warp in the oven like cheaper bake items.  About the only downfall is because the handles stick out instead of pointing up  ( like a ""real"" baking pan"")..it is hard to soak in the kitchen sink.  overall a great pan for the money."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Worth every penny... and then some!,"I bought this machine mainly for making smoothies, and it works like a charm.  I add all my ingredients at once (including ice cubes), turn in on, and in less than a minute (literally!) I have a perfectly blended smoothie.  And unlike another reviewer, I love the one piece jar and blade.  I think it makes cleaning a breeze. No more breaking it down into 5+ pieces to clean.  And unlike the other reviewer, I don't think the blender is too big, or too loud.  It's an industrial strength blender, what do you expect?!  And the lid slipping, I don't know what that guy was talking about... my lid fits ultra snug, no problems there.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Best rice cooker/steamer I've ever owned,Bravo Sanyo for creating a rice cooker/steamer that cooks the best white and brown rice I've ever had!  Both white and brown rice come out nice and fluffy and also keeps it at a perfect warm temperature for future servings. Also very easy to clean! I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Magnificent aroma,This is a very beautiful flower which has wonderful aroma. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it to all people who value charming plants. It would make a great gift as well
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Highly recommended,"Have been using this coffee maker for several months and would highly recommend it. Makes two regular sized cups of great tasting coffee. Very well designed. Filter basket is simple to remove for cleaning and very easy to access for filling. Water reservoir is also easy to access and there's a highly visible water level indicator with a red floating ball on the side of the unit. I don't use the metal mesh filter because it allows some sediment through, but it was nice they included one. Uses efficient cone shaped paper filters available anywhere."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Chips ahoy!,"The Sango Splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous, no doubt about it. It's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand. So what's the problem? It chips. I've had a set of eight place settings plus various serving pieces and other extras for about two years. At last count, there were five pieces with chips and one cracked cup. That doesn't say much for the set's longevity, especially since I don't use these every day."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,Great Skillets for a Beginner.,"Please note firstly: if you are buying cookware for an entire family, this set is NOT for you.  If you are an individual, this set will work."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,I just love it!,"It's great for tea/cocoa/coffee, but it's big enough that you can use it for cooking. The 7-hour delay feature is terrific -- and saves electricity."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Elegant but reasonably priced,"I have been using this corning ware for over 25 years and have had only a few chipped places, but no cracks what so ever!  They are great to bake in and if sprayed with vegetable spray, clean up is a breeze.  Great in the dishwasher too"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love This Grill,"We purchased the original Forman Grill, forever ago and decided it was time to upgrade.  I purchased this one & just love it ... Even more than I loved the first one.  I usually only made grilled cheese or warmed up leftover hamburgers on it for my little ones.  With this one, among other things, I am able to make waffles, cook bacon & eggs for a great Suday breakfast for a family of 6.  The only drawback for me is the fact that I've got to store all those different plates and try not to scratch them up too badly. Overall this is a worthwhile purchase"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Cozy and Warm!,Im abit surprised by some of the low ratings on these sheets. I have purchased 7 pairs in multiple sizes of this brand including the twins mentioned here and everyone has commented on how great they are! I am very pleased with mine
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,Very Happy,"I originally received a hoover FloorMATE for Christmas, but found it was too lightweight for my ceramic tile.  So we did a ton of research and returned the MATE for a floorMAX.  I am sooo pleased.  I have a toddler and two messy dogs, and my floor goes a long time without getting cleaned.  This machine scrubs up dried apple skins, bits of dried strawberry, jello, etc.  I do not use it on my carpets because I have a bissell green machine that I'm happy with.  But this has been a lifesaver on my ceramic tile floors.  I'm so lazy, I have to admit that I actually used the floorMAX in my shower to clean the shower floor.  Worked beautifully.  :)  The tank is more than adequate - I used only half a tank to clean my 3000 sq foot home that is about 50% tile."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,HORRIBLE  MESS !!!!!!,This product LIES LIES LIES horrible disgusting soupy mess doesnt even mix at all ! Cost of products to make ice cream almost the cost of the machine ! Total waste of my time and my money I wish we could all sue rival for our time wasted and cost of machine and aggrivation ! The mixture doesnt freeze and It sticks to the walls of the bowl and machine stops working ! what a mess !!!!!!!!!!!!! also my machine smelled like it was burning after 5 minutes .
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great product,"I had a BTB smoothie maker for years and it finally died. I searched for one everywhere and they all looked like plastic junk. This one is very sturdy and seems it will last for a long time. I like the glass container and heavy duty professional design. I have only used it once but it worked great and was not any louder than my old machine. My kids like banana smoothies. 1-2 bananas, 1/2 cup apple juice and 6-7 ice cubes. Simple, nutritious, delicious. So far, I am very happy with my purchase."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Do you LOVE coffee?,"If you really love espresso coffee, then you need to grind your coffee beans; this is the best way to get great results. And you need a good conical burr grinder, such as the Capresso Infinity. For a decent price, you get excellent, uniform ground coffee. Enjoy"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Fantastic meat grinder if you have the Kitchenaid mixer,"Even if you never thought you wanted to grind meat yourself, you should consider getting this.  Anyone who has traveled to Europe can tell you that we Americans have been getting fed the most flavorless sausage in the world.  But, it doesn't have to be that way.  You can find recipes and casings online and make them yourself.  To make sausage, you will also need the sausage stuffer for the Kitchenaid stand mixer.  We have also discovered that grinding your own meat for hamburgers makes for more of a difference than you would think (hint: check out Alton Brown's hamburger recipe on foodtv.com)."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Dessert Plates,"I work in an assisted living facility and we use Fiestaware in the Alzheimer's area.  I didn't know these were salad plates until I was looking at all of the Fiestaware.  We have always referred to these plates as dessert plates.  They are the perfect size for a piece of pie!  They are also durable.  I have dropped a few of these plates and none have them have broken.  Thank goodness!!  These plates are very durable, too.  The style of plate is very classy and simple, which is great because you don't have to search and search and search to find flatware and glassware to match it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,2.0,Damaged Shipment,"The first shipment arrived with a broken piece.  When this was reported to Amazon.com, a new order was placed immediately.  I was impressed with the free shipping on the replacement order as well as the free shipping on the return of the damaged shipment.  The second shipment arrived quickly and was intact"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 4,1.0,"Please Only Post Reviews, not Sales Pitches",DeLonghi Electric Coffee Grinder DCG39 . I have had reliability issues with DeLonghi.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Worth Every Penny,"Toasts everything from bagels to waffles to regular bread evenly and quickly. The toaster grabs whatever you are toasting and holds it in position. Other toasters just let the bread fall to the bottom and don't grab it. I like the feature that once you've pushed the lever down to lower the bread into the toaster, you can't lift the lever to get your toast out - you have to wait until it's done. If you want to cancel the toasting you press the red power light instead and it pops up immediately. And as advertised, you won't burn yourself touching any of the black parts on this toaster. The sides don't even get warm"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Rowenta Ironing board,"This is the best ironing board I have every had, don't think of looking at any other brands, you ironing will be done in a jiffy, wide board is the best, and the area for storing the hot iron is very stable."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,1.0,Not worth purchasing,I normally buy my coffee pods from coolbeans and decided to give this a try as I had run out of pods and I had family over.
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,No problems here.,I have owned this pitcher for over a year and have never had a problem with it leaking
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,love this mixer,"with all other mixers i have owned  they would smell like they were burning. this mixer really has power,  the beaters are long keeping food off of the body.  best had mixer i have ever owned"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Versatile storage,I really like these storage containers. You can store all kinds of different things in them. I like that they are clear so you can tell when you are running low and that they &amp;quot;snap&amp;quot; tight when you close them. I have had no problem with them sealing and keeping things fresh. I used a permanent marker to write on them so I know what's inside (wouldn't want to mix up the plain and self-rising flour). I also like the molded grip. It makes it easy to carry and they don't slip out of your hands. I'm asking for more for Christmas this year
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Exquisite and Practical,Chirchill Brook Blue is a very elegant china made in best traditions of the 18th Century aristocratic Europe. High quality - made in England. I enjoy it in everyday dining as well as for formal gatherings.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Awesome dishes!,I was thrilled when I received my dishes! The color is even better than expected. Chili Red is just that....chili color. They are very contemporary and nice and solid. Can't go wrong with this choice
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Terrific,"This decanter is amazing (I have now bought three).  It is large enough for a 750ml bottle of wine when used properly, and will easily hold twice that if letting the wine breathe isn't your thing.  It is stylish, and makes a lovely addition to the table or bar area"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,love it,i love t-fal and love this stir fry pan.  i have also tried calphalon but t-fal never sticks.  i had to return my calphalon to the store because it sticks.  i just wish that t-fal would offer open stock fry pan/skillets with lids
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,love the toaster,It's the first toaster we have had in several years and are extremely satisfied
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,A Fantastic All-Purpose Pan,"After going with a non-stick version and having problems with that (not knowing the best way to use it), I exchanged it for the stainless version.  This was a great decision.  First, it showed me that All Clad does stick by its lifetime warranty.  Second, because I learned that I don't need non-stick for everything and I found out the best way to use this type of cookware."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Glasses!,"  I bought these glasses as a gift.  They arrived quickly and in good condition.  They are very nice.  They have a good feel in the hand, substantial without being heavy.  I would recommend these glasses"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,I can't believe I didn't buy it sooner,"This pot rocks.  You'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it.  It browns well, cleans easily, and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,2.0,They smell and are way too low.,These pillows fluff up nice but will have to be used on top of others. They also smell of chemicals
kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,2.0,Works great at first,I love it when you first start using it. But the inside does wear off and now I wonder how safe they actually are and how much of the wearing off stuff gets in your blood stream. I dropped the one pot and it dented really bad.  Next time I will use stainless steel. Feel safer with that. I wont by this product again.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Beautiful measuring cups.,"I was attracted by the comtemporary design of these measuring cups.  Their flat design allows you to get into places that you could not get into with the taller dipper designed cups.  They are easy to clean.  The stainless steel finish holds a bright finish.  I want to mount them under my kitchen cabinets, but I am having trouble deciding if they should be mounted separately or in a group.  The handy clasp that encloses them makes them easy to keep together.  I would highly recommend them from all standpoints"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Fabulous over cooker,"We've had two Romertopfs for over 25 years. They are perfect oven pots for most birds and many long-cooking meats. About cleaning: the reason the directions say use no soap is the porous clay absorbs the soap and renders it back into the food. However, when your pot(s) become really well seasoned from thousands of cookings, these restrictions no longer seem to apply. We do use soap, sparingly and quickly, to remove grease. (Note that my wife, Victoria Wise, is a professional cook and cookbook author; she would instantly taste soap in the food if there were any. Run an Amazon search for her name and you'll find descriptions of her many amazing books.) Also, we find that now that these pots are so seasoned we can stick them into a hot oven with no problem. Finally, we no longer need to soak them."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,What can I vacuum next?!,"I never thought I would want or use a vacuum sealing kit, but since we buy in bulk I decided to try the FoodSaver Pro III after reading the reviews posted here. So far I have used it for meat, bread, coffee beans,oils, candy,popcorn, nuts, brown sugar, cheese, and my husband worries what else I might vacuum? It is so easy to use, is relatively quiet, and keeps things fresh longer. Here in Colorado where it is very dry, this is a great thing to use to save food and produce. Excellent product"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 14,5.0,GREAT UNIT -- Worthy and Reliable and worth giving as a gift,"Great unit -- toasts evenly, consistently, and is easy to use.  The product is true ""KitchenAid"" -- good design, great functionality, and very durable.  KitchenAid backs all of their appliances -- no questions asked -- with a ONE YEAR REPLACEMENT GUARANTEED WARRANTY -- NO OTHER COMPANY DOES THIS SO WELL!  If you are expecting a sophisticated rocket ship, then head for NASA to buy one.  If you are expecting a reliable, hard-working toaster oven, it doesn't get better than KitchenAid -- nobody does it better -- KitchenAid is still the brand that does it best"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,These pans are the best!,"Aftere using my mom's hand-me-down Revere ware (it was her wedding gift 50 years ago) I decided it was time for some new pans.  I knew I wanted stainless, did my research, and chose these.  I am very happy with them!  In a word...superb.  Remember to keep the heat low and soak beofre washing and you too will be very happy with these.  And I love the glass tops"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Makes your bread crust very crisp,"This has to be my favorite pan for making the outside crust on the bread very crisp.  It seems that the heat flows better through this pan with the perforation.  While the pan is very sturdy and of a heavy gauge, it should provide you with wonderful bread in the years to come.  Be sure to give the pan a quick spray of non-stick spray before cooking, but you would do this when making any kind of bread.  The three loaves gives you just enough bread so that there won't be any major dicussions of who is getting the last piece of hot bread.  If you are a bread maker and haven't given bagettes a try, this would be the idea pan to do this with"
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Another explosion victim,"Don't buy it!  My husband took my pork roast out of a 425 degree oven and set it on top of a warm stove top.  It exploded, sending glass everywhere.  Thankfully, my daughter was not in the room.  I'm throwing all my pyrex out"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,No more expensive replacements!,"First Hamilton Beach we have purchased.  We have used it 3 times, so far so good.  No drips, no leaks, coffe is hot and steaming but not burning your mouth.  No glassware to break!  (By the way that's why we purchased a new coffee maker)  Timer, automatic shut off, easy to use........So far we love it.  Nice upgrade."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,5.0,Slice and Dice,"Any one who calls themselves a chef got a Santoku a couple years ago.  I thought, big whoop.  When I saw this knife, from Kitchenaid, I tried it and it is now the ONLY knife I use.  I have bought one for each of my kids and have been giving them to friends as Hostess gifts.  I have the complete compliment of Kitchenaid cutlery and I have never used a better knife, for the money.  They are well balanced, easy to sharpen and if one or two get thrown in the dishwasher, the handles come out just fine"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,1.0,Disappointing...,"This product is like the company I bought it from- horrible. I ordered twice from this comapny in hopes that the second time around would bring improvement, I was very wrong. The second item was broken when they sent it and customer service let me know,""it isn't our problem once it leaves the building"". This item lets air in, creating stale food. Side clips do not last and break off after a few uses"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Poor quality,"Our first Black &amp; Decker coffee maker didn't even last a year. . . the water pump stopped working.  We took it back to Wal-Mart for a replacement and was sorely disappointed that the new Black &amp; Decker carafe dripped no matter how careful or slowly we poured.  It's strange because it looked like the same design as the last one which didn't leak.  Back to Wal-Mart for our money back.  Now we are wondering if there is a coffee maker out there that can make a good, hot cup of coffee that is convenient, easy to use &amp; clean, drip free and still reasonably priced. Also bought a Black &amp; Decker iron that leaks like a sieve.  Perhaps B &amp; D needs to go back to the drawing board and design products that are leak proof"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great filter for the price,"This filter does a great job for the money.  I can definitely feel a difference, and the air in my house smells nice and feels clean.  If you're having doubts about spending money on a filter, this is a good one to go for"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,DREAM TOOL,"This spaetzle maker works like a dream and produces professional looking spaetzle.  Follow the fabulous recipe made with milk that they offer on the package as it is truly fantastic.  If you make spaetzle, you CANNOT be without this tool"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Works very well, losing vacuum seal easily fixed","I have been using the cannister for 2 years with excellent results.  I use it to store a small supply of ground coffee, and am ordering a second cannister to store whole beans after I've opened the bag."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great tool!,"This KitchenAid scraper is great!  Besides the fact that it does what it is made to do so well (cuts and scrapes dough like nothing!), it also has a useful ruler and makes it easy to lift and move what you chop.  Super easy to clean, highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,Great Set Of Knifes!!,"I just received these knifes and I was very pleased.  The quality was great on the knifes and the box was even nice. You are always hesitant buying something without seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised with this set.  For the money you just can't beat it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Nice knife.,"All I can say is this knife is SHARP right out of the box.  The Wusthof and Henkels (high end models e.g. Classic and Five Star) knives cut like butter, but I prefer the Wusthof's look and feel.  The only problem is I am too scared to used these fancy knives, because I slightly cut myself when I was cleaning them since everyone says not to put them in the dishwasher"
kitchen & housewares,22 of 23,4.0,High quality at a fair price,"The dimensions of this cookie/jelly roll pan are 18"" x 13"" x 1.""   Note that these pans are the non-coated variety.  They are sturdy and live up to the Chicago Metallic name.   One of the two I received has a small dent in it, and I have had this happen on one other occasion with Chicago Metallic Commercial pans that came in a set of two.  I decided to keep the dented pan and it has not caused any difficulties in using it to bake cookies or roast vegetables or meats.   "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Corelelle enhancements are fabulous,"I have used these corelle enhancements for over 14 years now and they look nice, hold up well, and go with everything.  I have kids and the dishes are tough to break but when they do, I am glad they are still available.  The glasses are pretty and just the right weight.  Of course, with a sixteen year old loading the dishwasher, two have already broken but that is just how it goes, not the glasses fault. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,"bad design, bad performance","This is a poorly designed mill, cheaply manufactured. The grinding mechanism is easily clogged but difficult to disassemble for cleaning. The port into the hopper is too small and must be frequently unblocked. The hopper consistently develops excess static, causing large amounts of coffee to stick; it is badly positioned and fits loosely, guaranteeing a mess to clean up every time the mill is used. After four months of annoying service, the cheap circuit board attached to the power switch broke loose, finally ending the suffering. A nut chopper would work better."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Didn't work for us,"After a few uses, the spray function stopped unless I removed the scrub brush and the extraction capability was really lousy unless I really leaned on it. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Well designed spatula/turner,"I just got done putting my new KitchenAid short turner through its paces and I am very impressed with its performance.  Although this tool is smaller than its big brother in the KitchenAid lineup, it's actually a normal sized spatula/turner compared to most other brands.  It is right at home in 9&quot; - 11&quot; skillets and handles omelette turning extremely well.  It is flexible enough not to tear and damage delicate foods such as omelettes, yet sturdy enough to detach burnt on hash browns from a cast iron skillet.  Like the other silicone tools made by KitchenAid, it cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher (no leftover egg residue!).  I would highly recommend this product"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,A very satisfied customer,"I loved the look and feel of this set.  The pieces feel solid, they have a nice heft to them, and the shape of the bowl is deep--both pretty and practical. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Very Sharp and  a Great Price too,"This was my last shot at buying a low priced knife set.  After trying several others and having to simply toss them out, I finally found a set that is a keeper."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 9,5.0,I love this set!,"My wife talked me into this comforter set in King and I just wasn't feeling it. When it arrived I have to say I am more than pleased. Great quality, vibrant colors. The picture doesn't do it justice."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Good Stockpot at a Great Price,"Farberware 18/10 stainless steel cookware is a good line. I had this cookware at one time, and I can recommend it, especially for use on gas burners. Unlike Calphalon cookware, it can go in the dishwasher. However, to keep the finish gleaming, you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads. This 16-Quart Saucepan is a kitchen essential for anyone who cooks for a large group"

kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,hot,"This is the best toaster oven I have had to date..It is equal to ice out the door of the fridge, sliced bread or a garage door opener during a storm. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Extremely Disappointing,"I bought this juicer specifically for use as a bar tool, and it saw intermittent use on lemons (and only lemons) for about three months. While it did a decent job of extracting juice, the lever itself was balky, suggesting to me that the internal gear assembly isn't machined to particularly high tolerances. Furthermore, the spout is positioned EXTREMELY low: you can get a jigger/pony underneath it, but anything larger is an adventure. Finally, the ""stem"" isn't manufactured well: it had started to bend, thus degrading the performance of the gears even further, and when I tried to bend it back into shape with some gentle pressure, it actually snapped apart, destroying the juicer entirely."
kitchen & housewares,15 of 17,5.0,Casual Elegance,I gave this to my parents. They had been using the plastic lid of a cottage cheese container for this purpose.  Their lives are much better now
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Beautiful heavy-duty set,"I just received 2 sets of the Corelle Hearthstone in the green for my birthday (yes it is what I wanted and not a dumb husband buy).  They are beautiful and very heavy.  Definitely do not feel like a cheap set of dishes here.  The plates fit just fine in my cabinets with no room to spare.  I love the fact that the ""lunch plates"" are just right for a normal meal and not small saucers to go under the mugs.  I'll probably use the lunch plates a lot for our dinners or else we are going to get very fat.  I am looking forward to curling up on the couch with a good book and a large mug full of hot chocolate.  I think I already wish I'd gotten a 3rd set for when we have company over.  Christmas isn't that far away..."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Oven Mat,Wonderful.  I don't know how I have done without it all of these years.  Would sure have saved me some labor and mess
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Sturdy Design,This sifter is very sturdy and well-made.  The sifting handle is smooth  and allows whatever items you are sifting to flow through easily - no  shaking necessary!  This item also cleans up troublefree
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,5.0,I love this set.,"The T-Fal 9 Piece set is, so far, amazing.  It heats up quickly and evenly and won't burn.  It cleans well and I haven't had any sticking problems.  I highly recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Killer Steamer (Rice Steamer),"This thing is great!  Steamed fish and rice... I'm in heaven.  Target has them for $29.99 but eventhough their tag says, ""model #5712"" the box says, ""model #5715""... same steamer.  Well worth the money"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,help for choosing,Is it possible NOT to use the timer on this model in case I would like to cook something for over eight hours?
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent cookware at a great price.,"This is an even better set than the one I bought about 8 months ago.  I wish I had that larger frying pan and the really small saucepan.  This cookware is excellent and quite easy to clean.  The cooking surfaces cook very evenly and they are thick enough to avoid scorching.  I highly recommend this set.  You will love it, and anyone you give it to as a gift will love it.  I do agree that storage is a little bulky, but they are so great that doesn't bother me a bit.  I put a dish towel in between stacked pans to protect the surface"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Get a B40 - It's worth every penny,"I like coffee. I've tried Senseo and the Melitta single serve machines and they just don't make good enough coffee. I've tried espresso machines using pods and with ground coffee. They're better, but even with pods, they can be a hassle and a mess. I'm not comparing espresso and regular coffee, I'm comparing convenience. I realize there's a lot of espresso snobs out there. They need to get over themselves. Espresso isn't the be all-end all, regular coffee is good too!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A High-Quality Kitchen Tool,"This well-balanced tool came razor-sharp- it has cut everything presented to it so far.  And it is attractive, in a knify sort of way.  I am a little concerned that I may not be able to restore it to proper sharpness when required - I sure hope I don't have to buy a sharp one every time it gets dull!"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,What I expected,"I read the other user reviews about some breakage during shipment.  I ordered anyway with some worries.  But, everything arrived without anything broke.  I am happy with this set.  I like the quality of the set and are a little heavier than I expected (which is a good thing)"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,2 thumbs up!,"It works really well, my friend uses one for her 2 cats, I have one for my llhasa apso, and all three animals love it. The only problem is you have to take the unit apart when you want to clean the motor. Other than that, it's fantastic"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,4.0,"Great  item, but no pot is worth this much money!","If this hadn't been on sale for under $100, I wouldn't have gotten it. It's great, though! Looks good on the table, excellent heat retention (if I keep the lid on and let it set in a warm kitchen, it'll keep soup warm all day), and I like the size and heft. I'd have given it 5 stars if it weren't so exorbitantly expensive. I'm sure there are good Dutch ovens out there for less"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I love love love this french oven,"This is one of the best items to have in your kitchen.  It means 1-pot cooking when you're making stews, soups or casseroles from scratch.  The finish is fabulous and it stays that way.  It's pretty enough to serve from at the table.  This size is great for anything up to a moderate sized chicken or pot roast.  It heats evenly and retains the heat well.  I love love love this french oven.  I'm going to aim toward filling my kitchen with Le Creuset from now on"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Inexpensive but it works,"We were hesitant to purchase the pan because of its cost (less than all the others) and there was no picture to see what it was like.  We used it the night we got it to bake corn bread and it came out perfectly.  We did spray the pan lightly with ""Pam"" as per the manufacturers instructions.  Baked even through and through with a golden crust.  No rubber smell and worth the investment.  It did seem to be a little less hefty than our Kitchenaid silicon bakeware but it worked just as well"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,I would not buy a different mixer,"If you bake heavy bread doughs or large batches, this is the mixer for you.  I had a slightly smaller Kitchen Aid mixer, which I also loved, but the extra size and motor power of this model is invaluable.  It is a beautiful machine.  It is heavy and quiet, and very powerful, like an expensive luxury automobile.  It is also very beautiful, I have it in red, and it is just gorgeous with my red le creuset pans (they have the exact same color and finish).  It has a very useful feature where it starts out slow when you first turn it on, then gradually speeds up.  This keeps things from slopping out of the mixing bowl.  There are three things I do not especially like about this mixer, but you will notice I give the machine 5 stars anyway.  The first problem is really minor.  It takes some degree of coordination to get the bayonet at the back of the mixing bowl attached to the mixer.  The other two problems stem from the top of the mixer not swinging up, as it does on the smaller mixers.  Using the plastic chute accessory to load ingredients is a bother, so I soon stopped doing that.  When I put ingredients into the bowl, it is kind of an awkward, messy procedure.  Then, when you finish mixing, it is also awkward to get the beater out of your food product. If something were to happen to the machine I own, these problems would not keep me from buying the same exact machine again.  For people who cook large batches, this mixer is just wonderful.  If you don't really need the volume, you would be happier with one of the smaller mixers, the top of which swing up. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,No!  No!  No!,"Absolute piece of junk. Oil heated and then quit heating after expensive food was placed in it. After oil cooled to barely warm, it started heating again. Ruined the food. Ruined dinner. Sure glad I didn't have company over for dinner. Should have left the shrimp in it when I returned it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great set,"Has all the most commonly used sizes, plus the option of adding other measurement sizes from Cuisipro.  Different style than what is offered in the chain store"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,"Great machine, great price","Although not a huge motor, this machine does great not only for home use; but this is the 3rd one I've bought in the past few years for restaurants I work in. If you're going to make a lot of bread doughs or do a lot of grinding you'll probably want the bigger motor; but otherwise this one should do everything you want."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Very sharp in terms of blade edge and looks.,"I just recently purchased this knife and I was blown away. I am used to crappy knives - you know, those hand-me-downs that always get chucked into the back of the drawer... well not anymore! This knife is very sharp and easy to maintain."
kitchen & housewares,0 of 6,2.0,never got it,"I kept on receiving emails pushing back the date of delivery.  After 4 of these notices, almost 1 month later, I was then informed that the product is no longer available.  Although I was very excited about the kitchenaid at first, (my mom has one over 20 years old and it's still going strong), I am sad to say that I will never see the kitchenaid I ordered for myself"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,Chrome is Beautious!,"Well, I went from a piece of junk Black and Decker, whose bowl broke the second week I received it, to this wonderful quiet piece of loveliness.  I got it on sale at amazon, only paid $104 and no shipping.  You can't beat that.  I found that the 7 cup was too small for making big batches of hummus and babaghanoosh, and the 12 cup was just too big, so the 9 cup fell right smack in the middle.  Just by picking this machine up you can tell it is good quality, it weighs 21 lbs.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Plates are RED hot!,They are strong and sturdy.  Much better than the typical Corelle plates.  Loved them the first time I saw them.
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,Frustrated,"Unfortunately, I didn't see reviews before I purchased my cookie press.  It doesn't have enough power to push the dough through to form a decent cookie.  I thought it was something I was doing wrong until I read the rest of these reviews.  It's a total waste of money"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 9,5.0,Great product!,I was skeptical at first... but it works great!  Especially on champagne!  I hope Erik Russell &quot;M.D.&quot; (the negative reviewer)isn't really a doctor-- I wouldn't want him giving me medical advice!  Looks like HE's the one that failed general chem!  ;^
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Incredible!,"You know, I was sure the needle would snap off or it would cork the wine as the needle went through, but neither has ever happened. No wonder so many people prefer screw tops; they don't have one of these! I know I'm not going back, and I plan to bring one to every party from now on"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,5.0,Cobalt Blue,"I purchased this in Cobalt Blue. It goes with my Fiestaware dishes, as well as my Pzaltsgraf and Longerberger Pottery. I also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful, and much nicer in person than online. It has a large capacity, and pleasing lines. I'll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals, to be able to use more than one"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,2.0,Not satisfied,"I have Calphalon pans and I hardly ever use them because you have to be so careful how you cook.  The heat has to be just right, you can't use spray on oils such as Pam, food sticks if you put the food in while it is cold, if the heat isn't just right food sticks too.  Very frustrating for me.  I LOVE to cook, but I regret buying these pans"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,A couple tips...,"I have used this a few times, and found I needed to lightly brush the metal mold with oil before laying down the first sheet of pasta, or else the dough stuck and was difficult to remove.  Also, I think brushing the edges around the filling with egg or water will help give a better seal.  I make 40 raviolis at a time and they have all kept their contents from spilling out into the boiling water.  It takes me about 2 hours to get the job done from making the pasta to cooking the raviolis (I use the KA pasta attachment which is wonderful).  It's actually a bit of work, but the taste is otherworldly and definately worth it when you can spare the time. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Wondeful,"I love this grater.  It really shows nutmeg who's the boss.  However, don't get over-confident and think you can use this for cinnamon.  Cinnamon has to be ground professionally.  I would also recommend using a larger model for ginger, if you have one."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Used this system for 12 years and counting,I'm still using my original 12-year-old Toddy Maker and have added one more. I make 2 containers at a time. Here are the benefits:
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,It Won't Hold An Edge,"I bought this as a replacement for a damaged Wusthoff slicer. It was a total waste of money. Even slicing poultry, it simply will not stay sharp. Other knives get honed on a monthly basis, but this one needs to be honed three times in a single turkey slicing job! It is &quot;outa here&quot;!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Surprisingly powerful little clips,"Now that I've ordered my THIRD set of these, I thought it only right that I officially say, I love these magnetic clips."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,finally- a good looking kettle that works well!,"This kettle looks, feels, acts and is expensive.  So if you like ""high-end"" stuff, this is the kettle for you.  It has a great weight to it and everything feels well made (this coming from someone who hopes to be designing products for the rest of her life).  It's quiet and boils water quickly.  The ""ding"" when it's done is a little quiet so I often forget I've been boiling water, but I'm sure that if it were louder, I'd complain as such.  I was worried about regretting spending $70 on a kettle, but I'm glad I did.  I have no regrets, and it's worth $70 to pay for a great kettle that I use every day"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Nice skillet I bought more Lodge Pre-seasoned items after using this one,"I went to Macy's looking for a cast iron skillet. They just had the small skillets and they weren't pre-seasoned. The clerk recommend that I go to Williams-Sonoma, which was in the mall. Williams-Sonoma had this skillet and it was priced at $24."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Warm beer into cold in one minute!,"Does what it claims to do.  Cools from room temperature to about 40 degrees in 1 minute for cans, 3 1/2 for bottles, 6 for a 750ml bottle of wine.  Be prepared to burn through ice using this - about 16 cubes to start it up and around four cubes for each successive bottle/can you cool.  It spins the bottle/can under a stream of icy water to cool your beverage in no time.  Moreover, it sure beats throwing a bottle in the freezer and having it explode when you forget it.  Despite the spinning there is no eruption from your can or bottle when you open it - just a bit of a welcoming ""burp"" when you pop it open."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,best pizza cutter,I really like this pizza cutter.  Easy to clean.  Easy on the wrist and arm.  I've bought two or three to give away.  We also use it for cutting our granola bars. Nothing else like it!!!
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,"Great for new people starting out, unexceptable to seasoned cook","I purchased the 2-piece set on a Friday special.  I wanted a inexpesive back up to my Wustoff Classic knives for the times my gf was attempting, and I say that loosely, to help me in the kitchen.  What got me was the price, decent reviews and the fact that they're forged.  I also had a wustoff santoku before so I'm not new to the santoku style.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Star at Thanksgiving,"I have a set of regular chef's knives, but there is ONE application for an electric knife that is unparalleled. That is carving turkey or ham, but especially turkey. The meat of a roasted turkey tends to tear, even with a good slicing knife. The oscillating motion of an electric knife does a great job on hot turkey and speeds the process of getting the sliced meat to the heated serving dish and to the waiting holiday table. I never use it otherwise, but for two holidays a year (Thanksgiving and Christmas) it is indispensible"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,dont buy any rice cooker of this brand,"I have bought three rice cooker , all from Aroma , and they all stopped working after a month or so.  You can try your luck "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,2.0,They smell and are way too low.,These pillows fluff up nice but will have to be used on top of others. They also smell of chemicals
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Best Accent Piece,"When I recieved this piece, I was so excited! It was as beautiful as I thought it would be. I was a little worried it might be made of poor metal or the votives would come broken. Nope, this piece is very sturdy and the votives look wonderful. It is a beautiful piece on my wall. It adds a fabulous ambiance to the room. I had seen others similar from Pottery Barn for $100. What a great buy! Good luck"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent!!!!!!! Highly recommend,This fondue set is excellent for cheese and meat fondues but not for chocolat.It heat very fast.
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,4.0,fast fast fast!,"This product mostly measures up to all of the other reviews. All I can add is that it IS extremely fast and easy to make ice cream/ gelato/ frozen yogurt, etc. The only thing I disagree about is the cleaning. There is no easy way to empty out the warm/hot water that you clean the tub with. I keep a sponge dedicated to this unit for cleaning, but I never feel like it is truly sanitised between uses. A removable tub or drainage system would be a great improvement. Or, maybe I just don't know the trick to the ""easy cleaning"" that all the other users rave about"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Fabulous products...great hostess gift!,"I have been using my Concerto for several months now, and I am a raving fan! I drink wine frequently, but seldom finish a bottle in one evening. The Concerto is so easy to use to ""vacuum-pack"" your leftover wine for storage in the fridge. The unit makes a little chirping noise when the vacuum is reached, so it's foolproof to use. Wine stays fresher longer, and I am a happy enophile! This set also includes a crystal wine server, which is great for stopping drips!  For the price, this is a fabulous gift (for you or someone else!)."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good value.,"Sleek, attractive and a keeps a bottle nicely chilled. A good product worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Ground beef grease extractor without compare,"For years I have been looking for some kind of press that would allow the grease to be extracted from cooked ground beef. Draining and paper towels sops are inefficient or messy. One day I saw my mother-in-law using a potato ricer to make mashed potatoes and in that ricer I saw my cooked ground beef grease extractor press. With the small screen installed in the Cuisipro ricer, its da bomb for ground beef grease extraction. Due to the very sturdy stainless steel construction of the ricer, you can really lean into the task without worry of bending the tool. "
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,This is a great product that does what it says.,"I bought this a week or two with the idea of making my own nut butters. I haven't gotten around to the nut butters yet, but I have made a few things so far."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Simple and it works,"Those little stoppers work like a charm.  They are simple to use and do a great job of preserving wine.  Okay, so maybe they don't preserve wine for quite as long as advertised, but they do a great job for 5-7 days.  Hey, if you don't down a single bottle of wine in a week, you should probably switch to a different beverage.  I give this little product an A+"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Better than I expected,"My father and I purchased sets of the Shadow Iris Livingware for my mother's birthday. Although the pictures of the set looked pretty, you never know until the package is opened. The sets arrived earlier than expected just in time for her birthday which was a pleasant surprise. When mom opened the package, the design was really pretty, the pictures did not even do the design justice. This is a beautiful casual set of dinnerware. One of the glasses was broken, but the company very quickly sent out a replacement."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Better than Meds,"Having attempted to cook eggs for the first time at 4 or 5, it drove me nuts to try and use Stainless and have the eggs stick. I got a diamond pan @ Sur La Table that was good, but it did not wear well. Things started to stick, heating was uneven. This new pan is unbelievable. It has a bit of a lip on it so if you are used to flipping things, it's a tad tricky at first, but once you are used to it, it's ideal"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Works Fine,After reviwing various coffee makers using various website I finally decided on the Black & decker DCM2500B.  I was looking for a coffee maker that would pour a cup of coffee without spilling or taking forever to pour.  Having had a Krupps 10 cup maker I was greatly upset with how often the coffee dripped off of the bottom as I was pouring a cup of coffee.  The Black & decker DCM2500B coffee maker does not spill a drop and makes coffee that taste just fine.  I highly recommend this machine if you are looking for spill proof pouring
kitchen & housewares,1 of 17,2.0,Kinda Ugly,The product could be designed a little better in looks. Ugly. As far as fish go. Who cares about the fish!  They have no feelings. Love them if you will. Fish are suppose to be in the ocean or lake.  Who cares! Most aquarium fish we not removed from their natural habitat... so what if the feel narrowed. Dumb fish dont know the difference. They live and die the same.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love it!,"Performs exactly as advertised-no more baked-on sugar toppings or blackened muffin cups.  I was concerned that the cups seemed smaller than my regular ones (the little paper liners fit in there more snugly), but the muffins turned out great.  Well worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,Maybe I expected too much?,"I was very excited about the prospect of silicone bakeware. Silicone seems to be the wonder material of the 21st century, yet, I have been disappointed with the results. The tube pan is very bendy and when I giggled it a bit to see if my cake was loose enough to remove, I wound up with a crack right down the middle. When I got my cake out of the pan (easily), the center was as white as when it went in the oven. I'm used to having the centers brown up with my regular tube pan."

The day after I plugged in the Honeywell 17400 unit, by the following morning, I had no nasal congestion, no sore tight throat, in the morning, ALL my symptoms were gone and haven't returned since I've been using the unit daily in my upstairs bedroom (past 4 or 5 months). I can even breath easier while sleeping. The unit is noisy; it isn't quite at all when running on the highest speed. At night I turn the unit down to its lowest speed, I can hear it but it doesn't disturb my sleep"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,The Best Gift I Ever Received,"My roomie gave this to me when my old crockpot died over a year ago.  I absolutely love this one.  I use it at least once a week, if not more often.  As a busy student who works full-time, this is perfect for me.  No muss, no fuss.  The removeable crock makes cleanup easy.  I couldn't have asked for a better gift for making cooking on a very busy schedule easier"

kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,great for 100% whole wheat pasta,"This machine was recommended for pasta with freshly milled whole grain.  Does an excellent job with 1/2 kamut and 1/2 soft white.  I use eggs instead of water, and follow the measurements exactly.  I'm sure that it would do a great job with white flour"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great dinnerware!,This is the first time I have purchased fiesta dinnerware and I love it! The cobalt blue is beautiful. I purchased two four piece settings and received two more settings for free! The dishes were very well packed and shipped quickly.  I will definitely be adding to this collection!
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Works great for frozen pizza too!,"I bought this baking stone, one year ago, after it received a recommendation from America's Test Kitchen.  This is the first stone I've ever bought, at the age of 35.  I finally decided to buy one after having my pizzas come out with either burnt or soggy crusts.  I'm happy to say that it works just as well one year later after repeated use."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Better Than Pictured!,"So much more beautiful than it looks in the picture.  It has a nice depth (3.75"") and is perfect for serving just about any main dish or large vegetable (corn on the cob, stuffed peppers).  Matches all of my other Splash patterned dishes perfectly, and is a great resting place for fruit when not serving my family dinner.   "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Good skillet for family meals,I really am enjoying this Faberware Classis 12-Inch NONSTICK skillet.  I cook with it practically every night.  It is the perfect size for my family of four and I don't even have to use cooking spray or oil in it!  Just place your steak (or favorite meat) in it and you're on your way to a delicious meal! Well worth its price and clean-up is a snap!!

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,LOVE AT FIRST TOAST,"I got this toaster almost 7 years ago while living alone and subsisting on bagles as a primary food group. Once my husband and I married and moved in together, the toaster got twice as much use; and with the addition of our daughter and her love for toaster waffles, it has seen even more wear and tear. AND, after all these years, we have not had a single problem with it toasting properly. We have been very happy with it! I see that a lot of other people have left reviews that it doesn't toast evenly, but we have never had that problem. I love the chrome exterior and the retro style, too. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to clean, but since we only use it for bread items, I don't get overly concerned about the crumbs that I can't remove. WE LOVE OUR TOASTER"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,1.0,Bought it and was not satisfied.,"First one lasted 3 days then quit working. [...]That one never worked right out of the box. Koolatron didn't respond to my emails about the second unit. I wouldn't recommend this product, nor any other product from this company"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Does a fair job,"I like the way this product looks and I like the large container, since I make large pots of coffee. However, it does not grind beans as well or quickly as other products I have owned. The blade is further from the bottom, and maybe that's it. I don't know why, but I have to grind the beans for close to a minute to reach the consistency I like. My last grinder, a smaller, cheaper product, was more efficient and lasted about ten years"

This is a beautifully made piece of kitchen gear, with a nice mirrored finish on the outside, made from heavy gauge steel, and a nice, solid-feeling (I guess it could be solid) handle."

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Adore them!,"We've had these for about three years now and I couldn't be happier with them. I think they are very thick and rugged glassware, we have not broken or chipped even one. They are BIG, one of the main reasons I choose them. The bigger one can fit a whole load of ice and a can of soda. They have a very sturdy base and one would be hard pressed to accidently tip them over, this was my other main criteria with three kids. "
kitchen & housewares,42 of 43,4.0,Compare newer models carefully!,"I had the old one with the orange top.  That one has a top basket to hold the tea bags which incorporates a side lever to plug the bottom drain hole, and an overflow channel so just the last couple of cups steep the tea until you pull the lever to release them. The new one with the blue basket has done away with that lever (I'm guessing to cut costs) and just put a little bit smaller hole at the bottom.  They also tell you to use a coffee filter in the basket in addition to the teabags themselves, which after all are little paper filters.  This is probably to slow down the run-out of the tea to help it steep it a little bit longer.  My favorite combination of bags is one bag or Celestial Seasons Red Zinger, one Lipton Mango, and two Red Rose decaf's.  In the old one I would let this combination of tea steep for maybe 10 minutes, and it came out perfectly.  Using the same bags with the new one makes *really* tasteless, watery tea.  "

kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Our third Cusinart purchase,This saucepan is well made and cooks very evenly.I was surprised that the metal handle really kept cool as advertised
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Awesome wok ,"This is an awesome wok! I have had several woks over the years, but none I have liked as well as this one. I will keep this one forever. I read cast iron wok reviews where people have not liked the weight of a cast iron wok, but the weight is a plus for me. The weight keeps it on the burner while I am doing fast work, adding ingredients and stirring. The only time the weight is not a plus is when serving the food. But since I never pick up the whole wok to serve anyway and scoop out of it, so that is not a problem either. For cast iron, it is not that heavy anyway. The handle design is a plus too, the handles cool down fast and act like ears that set the wok on a double sink edge to rinse after cooking. The pre-seasoning really performs fantastic, it starts out being pretty much non-stick. The only time I have had trouble was when I put oil in the wok before it got real hot, then things didn't cook as nicely, and stuck a little. But after reading Grace Young's Breath of a Wok, I learned how to cook in the wok properly, and I completely and absolutely love this pan"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 20,1.0,Rival No Customer Service,"I recieved one of these for Christmas, I would love to tell you how it works.....but it is missing a plastic piece. Now to be fair, I lost it, in the confusion of Christmas it must have gotten tossed. I called Rival to purchase a replacement piece. What a joke. I emailed....no response. I called, they don't know what I am talking about (even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual), or if I get a rep who does know what the piece is, they say they don't have one to sell, but if I want to pay to ship the unit back and forth,they will replace it. I have left voice mail messages for non-existent supervisors. So, instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece, I will return this to the store as defective and get the money back. They lose a sale, the store loses a sale, they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit. DO NOT BUY RIVAL PRODUCTS, we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor, illogical treatment."

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,great pan!,"I like this pan--a lot. The product description is accurate:  the pan is a HYBRID, neither stick nor nonstick. Based on the reviews of some others in this forum re: infused anodized pans, I braced myself for a sticky mess at the first stirfry. But to my surprise and delight the food glided off the pan's surface. Maybe it's because I keep surfaces clean (as recommended by the manufacturer)? Or that I always add a fine film of olive oil? Or that I cook on medium heat? "

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,"Nice Pan, Easy Clean!","I decided it was time to update my springform pans after the last &quot;generic&quot; one dripped batter all over the bottom of my oven.  I chose this pan because of the &quot;no drip&quot; feature and have been pleased.  It is a nice lightweight springform.  The size is appropriate for either cheesecake, any other round cake, focaccia or deep dish pizza.  I bought two so I can easily make a four layer chocolate torte.  The BEST feature about this pan beyond the nonstick coating and &quot;no drip&quot; feature is the reversible nature of the pan.  Either end of the pan fits to the bottom (for left or righthanded person) which means the rim is folded to the OUTSIDE on the top and bottom of the pan rather than inside.  No more trying to clean out that silly rim at the bottom of the pan that cake gets stuck into.  A soft sponge wipes out the bottom and the sides.  It is literally a &quot;piece of cake&quot; to clean.  I haven't experienced any problems with flaking, though I have only had my pan for 3 months.  As with any other non-stick product, I avoid using metal utensils, always handwash and store with a papertowel inside if I'm going to stack something in it.  Hope this helps"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Love it!,I bought this item for my husband who had used a similar one while on holiday. He doesn't like the kitchen and isn't very good with gadgets but found this one so simple that he wanted his own. He now makes us breakfast which is a first in this house. It is so easy to use and produces perfect waffles every time. Ours came with a measuring cup so you use the correct amount of batter to avoid over-spillage. It is totally hassle free with hardly any clean up. You are definately getting your money's worth with this item. A good buy.

kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,4.0,Makes a crunchy crust,"I purchased the Sassafras Covered French Bread Baker after a few months of owning the bell-shaped version aka La Cloche. Both of these unglazed dishes make a significant difference in the texture of the bread's crust. I find the rectangular version to be more practical on a day to day basis, as you can make a large loaf that can be sliced up to make sandwiches. It's also a little easier to store. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Euro-cafe-bistro lovers buy these cups!,"This cappuccino cup and saucer set is an authentic european style of how cappucino is served. This is not the latte bowl we are used to in the U.S.  The cups are made of durable porcelain and are dishwasher and microwave safe.  I've been using these cups to make double espresso and find the shape and size of the cup truly brings out the flavor with enough room for a nice dollup of foam/merengue or just plain, straight, double-shot. The cups clean up in a jiffy by hand or dishwasher. It is the perfect size for the perfect cappucino. If your'e serious about flavor, function, durability, these cup and saucer sets do the job.  If you like the flavor and feeling of being in a european cafe/bistro, you will love this and other products in this cafeware line by Konitz."

This new oven looks great, it's a little on the large side but if you have the space it's well worth the coutnertop ""real estate"". I have absolutely no complaints.  I was even surprised about it's seemingly magic ability to repel finger prints.  I was prepared to wipe it down daily for fingerprints but it just doesn't need it.  That is an added bonus"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great brown rice cooker!,"This rice cooker has a GABA brown rice cooker function. It is amazing how much better brown rice is using this function. It also has a regular brown rice cooking function that I haven't used yet, but I really don't think I will use it. The GABA brown rice function is great. It needs to have a longer germinating cycle, but I just reset it twice to make it germinate for six hours instead of the two hours it is programmed for(8 hours or more is supposed to be ideal). The stay warm function is also wonderful. It kept my rice warm all day and it did not dry out at all. I love this machine and I am so glad I got it"

Some of the loops looked like they had been snagged on something when I received them, I washed the towels and they have fuzz balls everywhere. The edges on some of the towls have came unstitched and are all fraid after only the 2nd wash. I would NEVER ever buy these towels again. No way are they 100% cotton and worth more then $2 a piece.

I might buy another one in case this ever breaks, but I don't think it would be necessary.  My husband likes it because it will chew through anything in seconds.  It cuts like butter, and has a big gear and a good grip.  The handles are nice and big so you can get a good grip on it, and it has a bottle opener on the top, which works great.  I keep it in my favorite kitchen drawer"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent all-purpose skillet,"I bought this pan after reading a review in the NY Times.  I am very satisfied with it.  Unlike others, I haven't had problems with uneven heating. I've found that it retains heat extremely well and that it is essentially non-stick if I use lower heat settings (even with minimal oil).  I stuck it in the oven to roast beets which worked well.  It's heavy but that's a minor negative.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,The scent of fresh herbs,"This gadget is really useful, if you like the taste of fresh herbs. Being made of plastic , it can't chop as finely as its metallic counterparts, but it is easier to clean and (more important) it doesn't affect the flavour of the herbs with metallic aftertaste, which is especially important for basil.  It is very easy to use (just put some herbs in the opening and crank the handle a couple of times clockwise and a couple counterclockwise) and very easy to disassemble for washing (dishwasher safe). You can also assemble it to use it with your left hand. On the package it says you can use it for garlic and hard cooked eggs as well, but I haven't tried so far"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,great tasting coffee but you have to work for it,makes great tasting coffee but the chore of cleaning and drying the components after every use is tiring.well made unit. works as advertised.was sold as refurbished but unit i recieved looked brand new and unused.i paid 29 bucks with free shipping but i see that it is now 39.probably still a good deal at that price.controls are a little confusing to understand at first but with a little practice it gets easier.display is unlit and is hard to read. would be much better if it were lit up.if you program it to brew in the am while you are asleep the noise of the beans grinding will wake you without the need for your alarm clock! i like the programmible auto shut off feature.nice touch
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Smoothie Smoke Maker,We thought we would give the smoothie elite another chance after our previous model broke when the pitcher fell on the floor.  Making smoothies is great so long as you do not use alot of ice.  One you add a full pitcher of ice it becomes a smoke machine and the rubber/plastic gear shread and make smoke.  Now after 3 pitchers of margaritas we said adios to smoothies elite since the gears are gone!!!  I think we should all file a class action suit for this junk machine. 
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,I'm impressed (and relieved I didn't waste my money!),"I've had my eye on this machine for about 2 years (whenever it came out) and never felt I could justify spending SO much for a ""uni-tasker"", but with the sale price I thought I'd try it.  My only other waffle iron was the Disney winnie the Pooh one, which didn't end up getting used much- the waffles just weren't that great.  I just opened this one, tried it, and it made PERFECT waffles just like at restraunts/hotels- it blows my other maker out of the water.  And it is attractive enough to leave out on the counter, which means I think I'll use it more b/c it is in eyesight.  Can't speak for durability, but it is hefty and feels like it will outlast me.  I'm glad I tried this and my kids are thrilled to have something other than Eggo waffles.  I would buy it again.  Highly recommended. "

kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Outstanding quality and great price.,"This wire potato masher, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product over the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries."

First of all, there is no switch to turn the steam off while you are using it, and even worse, there's no good place to rest the hose producing the steam while you change out the garments if you actually want to do more than one article of clothing at a time.  Furthermore, the steamer itself does not work well, and does not efficiently remove wrinkles from clothing"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,A great value ,"I was skeptical purchasing a used or rebuilt roomba but when I received the unit it was reconditioned and worked perfectly.  I cannot say it was like new because I do not know what new is....  I will mention that I was so impressed with the unit I turned into a vacuum salesman.  Yep 5 of my friends and family now have roomba's and we refer to them as our employees.  The new battery allows the unit to run for about an hour.  That with the new brushes and pickup allows the roomba to do an excellent job as long as you do not have the following.....  throw rugs with long trim. throw rugs with over 3/4 inch heights, electrical cords, and wires for the unit to get all wrapped up in.  I would not be concerned about the rebuilt status since I have personal knowledge of 5 people getting the roomba used.  Good luck.  And one more thing.....  Do not watch the roomba clean the room.  You will waste an hour betting on whether or not it will get that spot of dirt.  And most of the time it does...."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,2.0,It cannot puree,"I got this as a christmas present so I felt bad selling it, but I had to.  It seemed like such a bummer that such a well constructed and powerful blender can't liquify anything (even though it's got a button for that).  The blender has a deliberately DULL blade and I could never can a reasonably smooth puree.  There's a lot of nice things to say about this blender and it's very easy to take apart and clean.  Which is why I was hoping KitchenAid would have a SHARP replacement blade somehow available (think of their mixers and how much attachment stuff they make for that).  That would make all the difference in the world to just swap a sharp blade in for soups, and putting the dull one back in for crushing ice or whatever.  As far as I know, they don't make a sharp blade for this.  Too bad"

I think this is a fabulous accessory.  I can now enjoy my apple-carrot mix at a fraction of the cost I usually pay for a cup of juice.
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,satisfaction was guaranteed ,"I received  the original order with a broken handle and it was promply replaced with free pick up. The deep fryer is one product also that is hard to find. I have been looking for this type for a long time and I have not found them in other store  including big stores like bed and bath  ,wal Mart or other store . The price  is really right for me also"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Best peeler ever!,"This Zyliss peeler is incredibly sharp and comfortable in the hand, and zooms through apple skins, carrots, and potatoes with ease. The blade is firmly seated so that it swivels freely but doesn't jiggle up and down. Its clever tip is perfectly shaped to cut out potato eyes or apple bruises with a flick of the wrist. I once had an Oxo swivel peeler and usually love their products, but the blade would pop out so easily that it was hard to clean and use. Take the effort out of your peeling chores: Buy the Zyliss"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Ice Tea Maker!,"I was not a tea drinker. For some reason, drinking hot beverages never appealed to me. I know the green tea is full of antioxidants so I thought it would be great to drink the tea cold, as in ice tea. I have not drunk ice tea more than three times in my life.  Because of this fast, convenient ice tea maker, I'm drinker 6 cups of ice green tea a day!  I like how easy it is to use and that the tea is iced and ready in less than 10 minutes!  It is easy to clean and store as well.  I recommend this ice tea maker to anyone. And I encourage everyone to get away from soda and drink more ice tea! After using this machine, I am sure you will"

I will put my leftover supper in it to take to work the next day and microwave at lunch. GOTTA TAKE THAT LID OFF BEFORE MICROWAVE. Cover with papertowel. Comes with lids that are airtight and will not leak if tipped over. Pyrex glass is what every home should have."

kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,1.0,One star is too high!,"I thought this slicer would be a really wise purchase...sturdy & would brighten my kitchen.  Wrong, wrong, wrong...it lasted all of two weeks, then as others have experienced, the wires all popped!  Wished I'd checked Amazon's feedback before my purchase.  Mine was an in-store purchase and expensive (for an egg-slicer).  Of course, I'd already thrown away my cash receipt (ah,well).  Then bought a Farberward slicer...very nice looking (black) sturdy (thus far) & I really like it...for less than a third the price of the Kitchen Aid."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Jane's maddening search,"I bought this iron about a year ago and I absolutely love it.  I too only use distilled water.  My mother came to visit and fell in love with it as well.  It irons everything so quickly.  I was able to steam iron a formal dress with no problem.  I decided to purchase one for my mother and it was defective, so we returned it. I went to order another one and now I can't seem to find one.  Amazon has had me on their back order since January 28 2006.  I hope to get my hands on one soon.  I would definitely recommend this iron. "

Having thrown the original cups away, I only have my one Starbucks cup anyway"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"My first ""real"" dishes",For my 2nd apartment I decided to get real dishes instead of the hodge-podge I had from dorms and thrift stores. I could not be happier w/these dishes. The price was reasonable and they are incredibly durable.  I really like the plum-it's a rich purple and it was easy to match it to other fiestaware.  I liked the color so much I got the mugs and 2 other kinds of bowls to match the dishes. It was a great deal and it will be easy to add to my kitchen set.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Perfect for all bakers!!,"I bought this a week before Thanksgiving. It is amazing! Easy to use, and easy to clean up. The only downfall I can think of is that the parts are NOT dishwasher safe, but it's not that bad. I have used 2 of the 3 attatchements, and it was simple. It doesn't matter how often you would use it, it's definately a kitchen staple!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent value,"Very good knife, close to $100+ german quality. It arrived sharp and is easily sharpened. Holds an edge well, almost as well as a pricey Henckels. Handle is very comfortable and cleverly shaped, fits both my large hands and the wifes' medium hands. If you have a medium to large cutting board this size chef knife is probably the most versatile"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Very happy!,"This is our second Roshco silicon dish and we love them.  One caveate that seems to have escaped some people reviewing these is that you may need to slightly adjust cooking times and temps for best results.  And as others have mentioned, even without spraying them stuff comes out clean (although spraying is still a plus."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,5.0,Must have piece of cooking equipment,"I absolutely LOVE this cookware.  Don't be put off by the seemingly high price.  You will hand this stuff down to your kids.  What's so special about it?  It out performs all of my other cookware (yes, even All-Clad) on the stovetop and in the oven.  The even heating is better than I could have imagined. It will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops.  And, as an added bonus, it's the easiest to clean.  I use mine for most everything . . . pot roast, soup, stew, pasta sauces, braising, slow-cooking, etc.  It's great"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Outstanding panini maker!,"Absolutely wonderful! Looks great in ANY kitchen! Works so well, so easy to use to clean just GREAT"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Nice product.,This is a manually operated product that does require some strength and is a bit jerky to operate. The handle could be better designed but it is more annoying than prohibitive. A  heavier base would be nice but regardless you would have to hold it in place. 
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,The best garlic press I've ever used.,"When I ordered this I couldn't believe I was spending so much money on a garlic press. I almost felt silly. The garlic press I already owned though was so horrible that I really wanted something good. I prefer the sharp strong taste of pressed garlic over sliced or minced garlic, and let me tell you this thing delivers. This is by far the best press I've ever used. I've had it for a month now and I LOVE it! I use it constantly. I don't feel in the least bit silly anymore for having spent so much on it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great mattress pad!,"I needed a couple of mattress pads for our household's beds (one a brand new memory foam/latex bed, the other an older spring coil model) and this one seemed to fit the bill.  I was expecting something fairly basic for the price, especially compared to the numerous other offerings that cost much more."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !!!!,"I ordered this ice cream maker after reading all the reviews and checking prices other places, and I made a very good investment in this ice ceam maker.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,The Perfect Centerpiece For Winterberry Collectors,"I stumbled across this candle holder because of a promotion that Amazon was offering.  It wasn't something that I had originally added to my ""wish list,"" but after receiving it I know would have been missing out.  The piece is beautiful!  It is actually larger than I anticipated it being.  The glass is etched and hand-painted with the Winterberry patten, and the footing on the holder is a deep ruby red to match.  The two glasses compliment each other nicely, and really play up the Christmas colors that are used in the Winterberry pattern.  In fact, the colors that are represented in this piece could be incorporated into almost any Christmas decorating scheme. Pfaltzgraff includes a candle with this item, so there's no guessing on which size or type of candle to buy.  The piece has a good weight to it, of course it's fragile, but it doesn't feel that way.  This item can have many uses during the holidays such as holding fresh flowers and greenery or filling with decorative Christmas ornaments.  I've decided to go the more traditional route.  I know that this candle holder will make the perfect centerpiece and accessory for our holiday dinner.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great little cutting board for our red kitchen,"I bought this cutting board for my wife because she is decorating our kitchen in red. We've been keeping it out on the counter as a trivet beneath a red bowl because the size is small enough to be unobtrusive and if you do notice it, the looks aren't bad either. As far as cutting boards go, I like the small size - it's perfect for cutting an onion, vegetables, that sort of thing. The rubber sides give it a nice grip on the counter and it's easy to pick up and push the food off the board into the pan or bowl. I also like that I can drop it in the dishwasher after cutting raw meat and other such things. For my needs, it's a perfect cutting board because the small size makes it really convenient to grab and use. Kitchenaid has done a nice job with coordinating all of their new stainless steel and color utensils, boards, and gadgets."

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Braun Flavor Select 12 Cup Replacement Carafe,"I was very delighted to find a replacement carafe for my Braun coffee pot.  I originally checked stores and could not find one. I also looked at replacing the entire coffee pot but the ones I liked were very expensive. I was happy when I could just replace the pot. I have used it every day and am very, very pleased that I did not have to go and purchase a new unit"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,5.0,Better than expected!,"Using this griddle is a breeze, clean up is very easy. I have not had anything stick to it, so once it has cooled, I just wipe it with a soapy sponge and rinse in warm water. I use this pan every day to make eggs, quesadillas, etc. and the food comes out beautifully with just a tsp. of olive oil. I've had the griddle for more than a month and so far, I love it!"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,No more 2.75 lattes from Dunkin Donuts for me!!,I have only used it 3 times so far but found it very easy to operate. I love the Caramel Swirl Lattes from DD but 2.75 is a bit expensive. Hershey's now makes a caramel flavored syrup so I use that to make my latte. The milk does stick a bit but nothing I can't handle. The convenience of making my own lattes at home sure beats having to go through the drive through at DD. I really didn't find it that hard to clean and mine is not that noisy. For a single serving it only took about 4 minutes for it to heat to a just right temperature. I'm going to get one for a friend for Christmas as she is the one who got me hooked on the lattes in the first place.
kitchen & housewares,26 of 26,5.0,a toast to a toaster that toasts!,"After several months, I can say with satisfaction that the Braun Multi-Toast is nothing short of magnificent.  A toaster that really toasts - the control lets one range from crunchy to lightly done. A toaster that can elevate the toast a step higher when its done.  A toaster that can easily accomodate the long slices from my artisan sourdough loaves (without leaving bread sticking out the top).  A toaster that reheats toast. A toaster that defrosts frozen slices, and then toasts them. A toaster that does a respectable job toasting bagels.  A toaster that is cool to the touch on the sides. And on top of that, a toaster that looks pretty fine.  Ode to a toaster - Braun has intelligently designed and made a great one"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Love it!,"We love our coffee and our very picky about what kind of maker we use, but when our machine broke down and we needed one in a hurry we picked this one up on sale. We've had it now for THREE YEARS and never had any real problem with it. It heats the cold water up so well we have to give it a few minutes to cool before we lid it or we can't drink it for an hour without burns."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Bought it and Love it,The only problem with the leaking that many are complaining about is operator error.  It is very important to seat the clean water and detergent tank into the handle as described in the users manual.  Failure to do so will result in leaks.  For those still having a problem try laying the handle down/horizontal when installing the clean water tank.  It is hard not to get the correct seating when the handle is horizontal to the floor.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Buy,"I agree with the other reviewers, this set has the look of much more expensive tableware.  We looked all over for a set and were on the verge of buying a Denby set, but this one won us over.  What's not to like, great color and pottery like feel.  We bought one set and went back for three more after realizing how nice it was.  One downside is lack of serving bowls and accessories.  The scratch potential is real as noted below"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Almost too sharp for its own good!,"I bought this set on a whim, because my set of Sabatier knives was lacking a santoku knife, and I wanted to see if I would enjoy owning one.  As it turns out, this one is so handy that I don't even mind that the handle doesn't match the other ones in the knife block."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Best gadget in MY kitchen!  Best friend!,"Without a doubt this is the BEST kitchen item.  I bought it a year ago and have tried to buy more as gifts for my friends.  Have just located it at Amazon.  Hurray!  I grab it for every chore- it is easy to clean, does not scratch nonstick pans, and it is so wonderful.  Buy one--you will not be sorry but will call it your best friend"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,"Poorly designed, messy to use","Ok, bought this model because it was the cheapest burr grinder I could find.  Read the reviews and thought some people are just too picky.  Well, I got what I paid for.  Nice looking grinder and grinds quickly and consistently, but boy is it messy to use!  First, bean container lid does not stay on and you have to hold it down during operation.  Don't even think I have a defective unit as I just don't see how it is designed to stay put.  Second, serious static electricity.  I know all units have some static buildup during operation, but the grounds get EVERYWHERE with this one.  Trust me, you'll have coffee grinds all over the place when you use it.  You'll just be grinding a ton of coffee each time to last you till the next time you have to use it.  Third, the container that collects the ground coffee is also poorly designed.  The lid can easily pop off as you're pulling it out of the unit (and again, there goes all the statically charged coffee grinds all over the place) and it is oddly shaped and has difficulty fitting into my large coffee canister for emptying.  A better design would have been to have the lid attached and sliding off partially for emptying.  Anyway, I'm putting up with it for now but expect to be buying another one in about a year.  Yes it was cheap but I'd recommend paying the extra money to upgrade to a better grinder."

I see that someone said with the right brush you could clean out the stainless steel film in a minute...I apparently never found the right brush.

After a year or so, as with so many other buyers, it wouldn't hold a charge, and I had to throw it out. However, I liked its powerful motor  and the convenience of using a cordless vacuum, so I decided to give Euro-Pro another chance and bought this model. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Mixer,"I am very happy with this mixer.  I am taking a cake decorating class and needed a mixer with power.  A Kitchen Aid was recommended by the instructor and a few of the students.  So I started searching the internet and then remembered Amazon.com. Was I ever glad...not only was it on sale, but there was also another 25$ off. I saved at least 70$. Today the Kohl's ad had them on sale for 169."

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Not the same size as the Original,"I have used Farberware sauce pans for over 30 years.  They have been dependable, easy to use, and easy to clean. Recently I accidently boiled the 3-qt saucepan dry.  Very dry.  The aluminum clad bottom separated from the pan.  I have the double boiler and steamer inserts for this size pan.  I just needed the replacement 3-qt pan.  I ordered the Classic.  It certainly looked like the same pan and held the same amount, 3 quarts.  However, although it is labeled ""Classic,"" and the style is similar, it is smaller in diameter and the inserts won't work with it.  I wrote to Farberware.  Their reply acknowledged the different sizes and would I like to buy more new cookeware?  The new but not-quite ""Classic"" pan works fine.  If you aren't trying to replace a classic saucepan, try Farberware.  You will probably like it as I have. "
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,We love ours. ,"We've had our set for 3 years and we love them. They cut like scalpels. I like that they are lightweight and don't take up a lot of room.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,50 STARS!,"I purchased this Vacuum on the strength of a salesperson's recommendation. Based on my own experience, it is very clear to me why she recommended Hoover, and more specifically recommended this particular model. This Vacuum can handle carpets, and hard floors very efficiently. It also has several attachments, one of which is EXTREMELY useful for cleaning upholstery. And almost everything else is on board as well, with the exception of the extended nozzle, which probably has a place on the machine, and maybe I just haven't discovered it yet. "

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"A bit overpriced for what it is, but a great and necessary tool!","This product is inexpensive plastic: it consists of two clear pieces in which to store a loaf of bread and a white piece that is used as a cutting/slicing guide. Pretty straightforward, and consisting of probably a dime's worth of plastic for the whole thing. It's a very useful tool for the home bread maker, as it makes for better slicing of bread in to fairly-equally sized slices than using a knife alone (and ""eyeballing it""). If you have a bread machine, you need one of these. Period."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 10,5.0,"nice well made set, good looking too","Solid set of good looking cutlery. As other reviewer mentioned, knives must be hand washed and dried after use. All higher quality knives are not all that rust resistant, the more resistant it is, the less it retains its fine edge. If you see your knives rust, it might be a sign of better quality (edge holding ability, ease of proper sharpening)"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect cake pan! ,This pan is the best because of the included cover. No more tin foil or Saran Wrap sticking to the icing. This was a goft for my Grandmother to replace her 30+ year old pan with lid that finally bit the dust. She was thrilled to have it and broke it in quite quickly.
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,the press,I bought this for my inside grill. I found when I cooked pork chops the corners wouldn't be quite done because they liked to curl up slightly.  This has totally fixed my problem.  I do have to adjust my cooking time because the press is a bit heavy & the meat cooks more quickly than before.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Are they ever sharp and comfortable in the hand!,"I love these steak knives.  I didn't buy this specific set, but I did buy the knives (2 sets of 4 each) ala carte.  I had an existing block due to replacing an old knife set.  I have been replacing my old knives with individual Henckels International Eversharp Pro knives.  They are definitely sharp and the handles fit nicely in the hand.  They cut through any type of meat with ease.  They feel to be ergonomically styled and are very well balanced.  One suggestion I can make for these knives (or any for that matter) is do not wash in dishwasher even though they claim to be ""dishwasher safe"".  Over time, it will ruin the blades.  That's why I am having to replace my old set.  These knives are very reasonably priced too.  I couldn't afford the real expensive knives, but I didn't need to as these are great.  I generally purchase my knife stock at Bed, Bath, and Beyond (have also seen them at Linens and Things as well as Macy's), and because I am not purchasing a block set, I have been able to use my 20% off coupons.  Hope this helped with your decision as to the brand of knives to purchase"

I've only been using it for a couple of months so I don't know how long it stays sharp, but it quickly makes perfect tomato slices.  I have looked at my local Target to purchase some of these for gifts and was unable to find any so I'm back to Amazon, ordering these to give to people I know can use it, like my mom.  I highly recommend this item! Even if you only slice tomatos when you're making burgers, you will love the ease and convenience this little gadget gives you"

It is a money saver and work saver combined!!!"

kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,1.0,Heartbroken,"I have loved my Kitchenaid mixer from the first time I turned it on, and believe strongly in the construction of Kitchenaid products as a whole.  But I received the pasta maker attachment for Christmas and am just heartbroken to see that Kitchenaid would continue to sell something that so many people have indicated does not work.  Like all the other reviewers here, my pasta stuck together as it was extruded, no matter how much flour I used, how long I let the dough rest, or what I covered the pasta disks with (italian dressing, water, etc.).  I just don't see how this could have passed any quality inspection with Kitchenaid, or after all of these reviews why Kitchenaid would continue to sell it.  Following all of their directions for the product to a tee does not produce any usable pasta."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Convenient and healthy!,"I love the fact that you can cook an entire meal in one of these.  I just steamed fish, veggies, and a fruit custard in about 15 minutes.  No oils, no butter - it's great.  The steamer contains all the steam (I also bought a deep saute pan that looks like a small wok with a handle and the steamer fits perfectly on it) and doesn't get hot.  My kitchen does not smell like fish either.  I highly recommend this item"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Nothing Beats Cast Iron Cooking,"I'm a mountian girl from the Blue Ridge Mountains in SW VA. I remember Granny use to cook the very best food I've ever eaten. Granny use to tell me it was the iron pan that made it taste so good. After Granny passed on, I got a cast iron fryer. But I had no idea how to care for it, barely used it and finally threw it away."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Pre-seasoned??,"Great grill, but after you follow all the instructions, add this info: pre-heat the grill and then coat it well with good canola oil.  Then lightly coat the food you're cooking, too.  I had a big mess to clean when I didn't do this.  Great for rainy days when cooking outside doesn't work"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 12,5.0,Workhorse,"This mixer is a real workhorse! I have done so much stuff with machine that I would not dare try with a hand mixer.  This machine will handle anything you throw at it, from whipping cream, mixing chocolate chip cookie dough w/ nuts, to really stiff bread dough.  The best part about this machine is it's weight, therefore it is not going to dance all around your counter like those cheap plastic ones do, and the elliptical motion on the paddles make sure every inch of the bowl gets mixed together!  This machine is something I use on a regular basis, and I don't hide it away either - the classic design is something to be displayed.  Well worth the money"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,The Cadillac of Cheese Planes,"We used to have 3 homes, with 3 kitchens and, naturally, 3 cheese planes. The  Hoffritz is the easiest to clean--the stainless stell is virtually impervious to permanent stains--and most resistant to bending in use. That last is the key. The more the plane bends, the harder it is to deliver  the kind of slices you want. More decorative planes--particularly with wooden handles--should be avoided. They can't go into the dishwasher, and the the guage of the steel, stainless or not, is always inferior to Hoffritz."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Wonderful pan.,"The size of this pan is perfect for anything I cook..not too big, not too small. The handle is comfortable to maneuver and seems well balanced with the pan size. Don't know the affects of wear and tear yet but hopefully if I wash it carefully as instructed, it will be just as great to use after a few years as it is now. Great deal for the price"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love it.,"I just got this for my office. The office coffee wasn't really what I liked, they brewed it too weak and the actual brewer was weird - it made coffee by letting hot water just kind of run through the filter, no pressure or anything. Anyway, I couldn't really make a big pot of strong coffee just for me because no one else would like it. My solution was this! Now I have my own coffee maker in my office and I can get a cup of whatever I want in just a few seconds. It is saving me from stopping at Starbucks every morning!"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,excellent cookware,"this pan is perfect for searing meat and not worrying about the ""non-stick coating"" becoming part of the meal. with a little care it really is essentially non-stick."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Not Bad,At first I thought the self cleaning box was perfect.  I still think it is a great solution for cat owners who are away from home often.  There is very little odor and in general I'm very pleased.  At times the cleaning mechanism doesn't trigger properly and I have to unplug to reset.  Otherwise no problems.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,It  Works Well - So Far,"My family makes and freezes four huge pots of spaghetti sauce every 3 or 4 months. The recipe calls for 3 large white onions to be chopped up for each pot - the most time consuming part of the ingredient prep phase. For the last batch we made, my wife pulled out this onion chopping device and said ""try this"". I was skeptical but willing to try anything to avoid chopping up 12 large onions. Well, it worked. I estimate it cut my chopping time in half. I thought I had broken it several times, since you really have to muscle the onion pieces through the blades, which causes a loud bang when the lid closes, but it didn't break."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Spice Grinder,Even thought KA does not recommend using this machine as a Spice Grinder many users have written just the opposite. I just received mine and immediatly tried grinding the pine needle like Rosemary. A food processor would not touch it. This KA ground it up perfectly in just a few pulses !! And the stainless steel bowl rinses any spice right out. I am impressed. The larger size bowl of the KA also allows for a good size amount of spices to be done at one time. 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,"For what it is, it will serve its purpose","This cover, like all Kitchenaid products, is very well made. The material is very heavy and durable. It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but it does keep the dust and junk out of my mixer. I have the smallest mixer and this cover fits pretty good. It might fit the next size up as well, but not any larger I wouldn't think"
kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,4.0,Be careful - razor sharp edge on StainlessSteel Drainer,"While this is a wonderful product - decorative and functional, I must warn you - while wiping the drainer dry so as not to accumulate mineral marks, the draining edge is razor sharp and I sliced my pinky finger at the second joint, so deep that blood gushed, and I could see ""pieces parts"" inside of the wound.  After serious dressing and a splint, it healed fine, that is not the issue - the issue is that this razor sharp edge can cause a major injury to someone else.   If there was a touch more pressure, I would have cut tendons and ligaments.  OGGI, please fix/recall the product or remove it from the shelves.  Since I paid cash and thew out the box I couldn't return it; I used a grinder to soften the edge of the drainer and kept it"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Decent set of utensils,"I definately got this set because it was KitchenAid and when with the Red kitchen theme I have. Overall, it's a pretty good deal. The spatuala and the peeler are awesome! The Ice Scream Scoop is just a basic Ice Cream scoop, but it does have a nice sturdy handle which makes scooping hard ice cream easier. The whisk handle is a little too bukly, and would have been nicer if the handle was round instead of oblong, so you can roll it between your palms for better whisking. The can opener is hit-or-miss. Sometimes it does a great job. Other times it is almost impossible to actually get a normal can open. I'm glad I bought this but mostly because of the color, styling, and the ""good"" utensils. I'm sure there are better-quality and better designs out there though"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Fantastic for pancakes,"Bought this at a local warehouse club.  Works great.  Heats very evenly.  The grill side tend to collect grease and carbon and not drain well, but the griddle side is great.  (The included scraper helps keep it draining).  You can do two very nice sized pancakes at once, and they both cook well. It's quite heavy, which gives it it's good heat capacity.  "

kitchen & housewares,10 of 15,1.0,Avoid this Slow Cooker,"My wife and I have enjoyed all the other Cuisinart products so when we were looking for a replacement for our old Rival Crock Pot we decided we wanted this one. Bad idea. Since getting it shortly after Christmas we have used it a sum total of one time. Why ? Because the ceramic cooking pot cracked on the first use even though we followed all the cooking and cleaning directions in the manual. It might have even been cracked from the get go. So we tried to get a replacement but they were back ordered for a month. So after a month we figured we'd get the new pot. No such luck, we were notified again that the pot would not be in stock for another thirty days. That would indicate to me a problem with these ceramic pots. So we are returning this Slow Cooker, our old Rival still works like a charm"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Shark Vac&#146;s  Rock!,"I have bought Shark Vac&#146;s before, have two of these and all I can say is that they Rock!  I don&#146;t understand why others have complaints unless they are trying to do the whole floor with it, the only complaint I would have is cleaning it out after of cleaning up a mess from the kids.  This has plenty of power and you can even rinse the filter with water, but the best part is the wet vacuum, with children they are always making messes and next would have to be that it is cordless.  It is also great for using in the car and van because the kids make plenty of messes in there also, plus with a scrub brush and a spray bottle of shout it works great on cleaning the upholstery and spots in the carpet.  Before this I was using a Shark vacuum with a cord and it was not a wet and dry one, so this is so much better because before I would have to drag out my big Wet &amp; Dry shop vacuum to do even little jobs.  I would recommend this to everyone but first you might what to try the other vac&#146;s so that you will know how much better this one is"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,excellent cutlery,"I purchased this set just over a year ago, and they still look new - held up very well to daily wear and tear.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Grinder,"I had heard many horror stories about coffee grinders--machines that constantly jammed, that offered no control over fineness of the grind, or that failed to grind consistently at any setting. Other machines, I had heard, worked well but tended to rattle the windows with their roaring sound or required hours to clean. So I approached purchase of such a grinder cautiously, and put off buying any machine for months while I looked at as many options as I could find."
kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,5.0,All-Clad Stainless 8&quot; Fry Pan,"This small frypan is my main item. I cook for myself only (usually) and if anyone out there wants to try out the All-Clad line of cookware, this is the one to start with. Once you do, you, as I, will want to expand your collection of this superior product. You can get messy with it; you can make a mistake &amp; have the heat too high, you can even leave it in the sink uncleaned for a day or two.....it will still clean up easily and look brand new. As stated in the ads, the handles really do stay cool; that's a nice change of pace! Not to mention the fact that the company is still in business; the lifetime guarantee really means something! Did I forget to say that this cookware is simply &quot;beautiful?&quot"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Great Value!,I love this book shelf.  Bought it to store my Mary Kay products!  It is beautiful and so easy to set up.  Takes 2 seconds.  Can use it for anything and it looks classy!  Highly recommend!  Would look great in a den or living room also
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,I was not disappointed,After reading these reviews I ordered two sets of the ivory queen sheets.  I had to order 2 to get free shipping so I took the risk.  I was not disappointed.  I just got rid of 800TC sheets that fell apart after about 10 washings.  They were so soft but did not withstand the washings or my kids.  I just received the two sets.  One pillowcase was thinner than the others but I will just slip that over my husband's pillow and he will never notice.  They did pill but so did my $65 flannel sheets.  I just took a nap in them and they were soft and cozy.  All in all I am happy with the purchase and thrilled I got such a great deal.  If ivory is not your color of choice pike street has several other colors and patterns (I wish I had seen the patterns before I ordered 2 ivory sets).

I especially love making burgers on it, they come out just right (though it is a bit shallow, probably not intended for burgers, so occassionally you have to drain the grease).

I didn't actually NEED these, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the set. These cups are extremely sturdy and very high quality. I'm not an expert, but I've never seen better, and I shopped around. I mostly wanted the 2/3 and 3/4 cups, but since I got them, I've actually used the 2 cup piece on several occasions and have found it to be surprisingly useful.

It cleans up very easily, looks beautiful, and fits nicely into my sauce pan.  Some people seem to be complaining about steam escaping from the pan.  Don't let this ignorant comment deter you from buying this excellent steamer.  Steam is SUPPOSED to escape.  If no steam escaped, you'd have what is called a pressure cooker.  And if a LOT of steam is escaping, then chances are that your sauce pan is warped, which means you aren't taking care of it.  Buy the steamer.  It's awesome"

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Unbelievable price for a great pot!,"First of all, in case you're concerned, let me say that the quality of Calphalon's stainless cookware has greatly improved as they have recently made the switch from not-so-good impact-bonded stainless bottom (Simply Stainless) to a tri-ply construction that's on par with All-Clad."

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,a great buy!,"I love this organizer. It is so helpful to be able to see your jewelry without having to dig through boxes or drawers. I would definitely buy another if I need to. The only downside to this item is that the pockets are not overly large, so if you have a really chunky necklace it may not fit, but thus far I have not had that problem"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Best home coffee machine,"We have had this Capresso coffeemaker for over a year, and have found it to be flawless.  We have had none of the small problems shared by other reviewers.  We did, however, put a small dab of white paint on the top's black dot to make it easier to see and position which might help others who are having a problem with that issue.  Not only has the machine held up to rigorous use, it continues to deliver fine coffee for us - and we are admittedly coffee snobs!  We recommend this Capresso coffeemaker highly"

It looks smooth and shiny and is easy to clean.  It's also worth repeating that this is very heavy duty, thick and heavy.

But, still works well and does the job"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,2.0,It cannot puree,"I got this as a christmas present so I felt bad selling it, but I had to.  It seemed like such a bummer that such a well constructed and powerful blender can't liquify anything (even though it's got a button for that).  The blender has a deliberately DULL blade and I could never can a reasonably smooth puree.  There's a lot of nice things to say about this blender and it's very easy to take apart and clean.  Which is why I was hoping KitchenAid would have a SHARP replacement blade somehow available (think of their mixers and how much attachment stuff they make for that).  That would make all the difference in the world to just swap a sharp blade in for soups, and putting the dull one back in for crushing ice or whatever.  As far as I know, they don't make a sharp blade for this.  Too bad"

Keeping with the fine Le Creuset tradition of fabulous cookware, the wok cooks beautifully. I have read elsewhere that high stovetop temperatures may compromise the cast iron, so I keep the heat to medium to medium-high. The cast iron retains heat beautifully, so you won't need high heat to cook. I give the wok five stars so far. If the handle cracks, it's back to Williams-Sonoma for another"

It is a great kitchen tool and we look forward to using it again"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Excellent for honing or touch up sharpening,"This is not a general purpose sharpener. If the V of the blade is too wide to fit the wheels, you will not be able to sharpen well. You could force it but you could end up notching the blade. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 11,1.0,Worst cooking tool ever,"I bought this because of the five-star reviews. It comes with four recipes:  three for fish, one for pork chops.  Nothing about chicken or beef.  The pork chop recipe says you can cook 1 1/2-inch thick pork chops in 14 minutes at 325.  So I thought I could cook a one-inch steak at the same temperature for a similar amount of time. It takes me 20 minutes using the broiler in the oven. Well, after thirty minutes, I had a steak that was burned black on the outside and only 90 degrees Fahrenheit on the inside -- in other words, raw -- not even body temperature.  So there went several dollars into the trash bin. Now about the clean up. They say it's immersible except for the heating element. However, you will need to use your bathtub or an industrial size sink to immerse it. Failing that, you will need a small brush such as a tooth brush and a lot of TIME to clean the grill. And you will need to waste a lot of water.  I ended up with water all over the counters, the floor, and myself. Someone claims to have cooked a whole chicken.  I find that impossible to believe, unless it was a very tiny chicken. As a long time cook with a kitchen full of appliances and tools, I am appalled that this useless and expensive item made it to the marketplace"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,"Perfect for daily use; versatile, durable, forgiving and easy to handle.","I LOVE the Calphalon Commercial line of cookware.  I purchased this ""odd"" size pan on sale, to jump start my fancy shmancy cookware collection.  But I can't have nice things because I am a five-alarm kind of cook, who tests the smoke detector regularly.  Soon after I bought this, I boiled water for something and forgot all about it.  I thought I'd ruined the pan, but with a little soak and a little elbow grease, it's right as rain."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"gets hot, but works!","There are two ways to use this utensil... plunge into deep fat, or cook one side at a time. If you do one side at a time, you actually have to fry one side, take hold of the cool side of the tortilla, and flip it over and fry the other side because of the configuration of the handle, you can't just turn the thing over.  You have to flip the tortilla itself. Still a timesaver if you're used to molding them in the pan with regular tongs.  I do wear a leather work glove on the hand I'm holding it with, though. It gets quite warm"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,TOTAL WASTE!!,"I wish I would had opened these when I got them, but I had nowhere to put them at the time.  So, I lost out.  They are a knock off of some sort...says they are made in Columbia and what gets me more upset than anything is that AMAZON has sold them and for the past 6-7 years I have bought many items from Amazon.com and NEVER had an issue with anything.  I really wish there was a way for all of us to get our money back since it has been lost to expecting we were getting a great deal on this dish set.  Now, I am trying to sell them on eBay and hoping someone doesn't care where they were made and that they are just a pretty set that they can enjoy"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,The Neatest Little Machine Ever,"The bowl and drive-post sleeve of my 26-year-old Cuisinart food processor have finally developed cracks so I started looking for a new one. Since I no longer need a full-size processor, I decided to try the DFP-3 Handy Prep. It arrived just a few days after my order was placed with Amazon and I am delighted with it. It's sturdy, heavy base fits into a small space on the countertop and it chops and shreds as efficiently as the full-size machine for a fraction of the price. I love it"

High quality construction, and the angled top makes use a breeze! we have a small one for the cat food too"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Better than Prescription,"My golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old.  Over the years we have tried allergy shots, dietary changes, and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune.  We tried Zymox and it is absolutely fantastic.  Her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment.  The itching and head shaking stop immediately after application, and if I treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears, I can keep her clear.  This stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges, I'm happy to keep it on hand"
kitchen & housewares,29 of 33,4.0,Replacement parts are not to be found,"I bought the Rival R0200 Roaster Oven to increase my oven space for the holidays.  One oven isn't enough sometimes.  I actually liked the oven, although the ham was done much sooner than I expected.  But the top plastic handle got broken while I had it stored in my garage, and I cannot buy a replacement.  I emailed the manufacturer, and my email was forwarded to The Holmes Group.  Their response was: ""Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately we do not replace handles on the lid. Sorry for the inconvenience.""  This is more than an inconvenience, its a safety issue.  The handle is what holds on the viewing window"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,The most useful thing,I bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly.  It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.  We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine.  I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Powerful Blender!,"Solid and powerful, with sharp blades. Only thing I wish it had were more variable speeds. But great for smoothies and frozen drinks... grinds right through ice"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,Disappointing product,"I agree with other reviewers - the grounds overflow problem is a BIG problem - they go everywhere!  The only thing I've found that helps is (1) be sure the top is tightly closed before brewing, and (2) switch to a heavier grind of coffee for less ""float"".  The permanent filter is only good if you like LOTS of silt in the bottom of your cup.  I tried the largest grind available, and still there's plenty of silt.  I'm glad to hear others are buying #1 paper filters - I'll try that.  Don't bank on this product being something Black & Decker will stand behind - I've talked to them once on the phone, and written online once, and they aren't able to help, nor do they even acknowledge the product shortcomings.  They actually seem surprised at its flaws!  I wish they'd have told me about the paper filters - that would have solved much of my complaints.  B&D has farmed out production and service to another company who simply puts the B&D name on it.  My best advice - rule this one out, and try something else.  There has to be something better"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,A coffee maker worth the money,"I purchased this one after needing a replacment for my Krups that had served me faithfully.  I'm one of those ""coffeenistas"" that home roasts organic coffee beans, fresh grinds the beans everyday, keeps a tasting book, sometimes uses a french press, and is VERY concerned about water quality and coffee taste.  first off and most importantly - The BrewStaion Deluxe makes a great cup of coffee..and hot too!  The water filter works well and coffee tastes as if using spring water.  Even with 2-3 cups left in the unit it doesn't become ""burned"" tasting. "

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Ideal for ME...,"I wanted to replace an old Teflon-coated 5/8 qt. pan that I used for melting butter, as well as for heating small amounts of gravy or other items. I was searching for a good saucepan for this use that was not pricey. For about $10 this pan answered that need... and the pour spout on it really IS non-drip."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,"Great machine, but a pain to clean.","I read the reviews before purchasing this machine so I wasn't surprised about the cleaning issue.  I look at it as the price for good ice cream.  I bought the machine because I wanted to control what went into the ice cream I was eating.  I try to avoid products with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives.  After having the machine for 9 months I still think it is great.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star and not a 5 star is the cleaning issue.  The problem is the bowl is an attached part of the machine and cannot be removed.  I've tried to clean it in couple of different ways.  One was by rinsing the machine and spooning the dirty water out with a cup.  It was time consuming and never seemed clean.  The second way, and the one I stuck with, is I carry the machine to sink, tip it and then wash it. It washes out very well and fast. The problem is the machine is somewhat heavy and awkward to hold and clean yourself.  I make the deal whoever eats the ice cream helps me clean the machine"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 6,1.0,Bought at Target--and it was already used!!!!!,"I had been researching processors for a while and was on a limited budget so I went with this one ($30 on sale). I got home so excited to check it out and it had a starnge discoleration on the blade shaft. I went on to investigate it and realized there was sticky, gross food all over it!!! OUTRAGEOUS! Then I plugged it in, and of course it didn't work. I don't know what the people who owned it before me did to it, but it obviously couldn't take it. "

Way to go, Black & Decker."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Wonderful starter set!!!,"I don't know how we ever survived in the kitchen without this handy set.

They'll appreciate it for certain"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,The Best,"It took a few tries to get it right with this machine. However, it gets it right! I had an early model, about 20 years old, and it just wore out. This one does an excellent job. The frother works great and gives me great frothed milk every time. I found that I had to warm the milk slightly in the microwave before frothing or it was too cold and cooled down the coffee. It is also important to grind your coffee very finely and tamp it well. When you do both, the cappuccino is as good as any you will buy out"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,Pleasantly humidified,"The TruAir 4.0 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier has done wonders for us.  We live in a very dry climate in Texas and this humidifier can keep certain rooms at a good humidity level.  It turns on and off by itself to maintian the 50% humidity level that we set it at.  Also, it is easy to fill up with water and wash all the parts.  If you need to quickly get the humidity up in a room you can turn it on high then run it at normal or the quiet settings.  On quiet, it creates just enough white noise that our daughter sleeps very well.  Due to the fan, this humidifier is not extremely quiet but we do run it in the livingroom and can easily listen to the tv or radio over it"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Fantastic pan at a fraction of the cost!,"I bought this item to replace a Costco pan that had the bottom coming off.  The Cuisinart pan is a little lighter than Costco's Kirkland signature brand, but boy does it work well!  It cooks quickly and evenly, and clean up is a breeze.  I wouldn't dream of paying hundreds of dollars for a 5 1/2 Quart Saute Pan when I can own one like this for fraction of the price.  I was fortunate enough to pick it up on sale for under $40, but even at full retail, you won't be sorry.  If this is the size and type of pan you are looking for, buy it!  You won't find a better product at any cost"
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Did I receive the same knives as the rest of the reviewers?,"Reading the reviews on this set as well as the great price led me to think I was getting a great value.  When they arrived I was a little unimpressed with the packaging but once I pulled the knives out the initial look, feel, and weight will make you think this is a serious set.  However, even upon the first use I quickly began to realize why they are so inexpensive.  Even cutting something as simple as a tomato the skin torn and vegetable flattened and mangled from draggin the knife back and forth just trying to get a cut.  These knives are pitifully bad, not just below average, but absolute junk.  They look good on the counter and the serated ones work okay (but anything serated will cut a steak), but as far as real kitchen knives go these fall very short of being performers.  I find myself using the steak knives to cut everything now which definately isn't the best option for most things.  Because they're stamped, sharpening isn't really a viable option.  They're not going to be easy to get a good edge on and they're not going to hold it very long either.  Save up another 40-50 bucks and do it right the first time or you'll be disappointed like me"

I use this knife all the time and i like it"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,A Definite Winner,"I've had this knife for several years now and it's one of my 2 favorites. I,in fact, have 2 of them, one in the house and one in our RV.This knIfe has an excellent blade that sharpens well (I use an Edgepro sharpener) and maintains that edge over time. I have a set of Cutco and some Chicago Cutlery knives and none of them compare with the Forschner. I have several different Forschner knives and all of them are excellent. You'd have to spend considerably more to find a comparable knife. My other favorite, by the way, is a handmade chef's knife crafted by a fellow in Oregon from old sawmill saw blades. A wonderful, hefty knife. Try a Forschner, you won't be sorry"

kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,It did the trick,"We've had a Braun variable speed processor for 7 years and didn't think that we could do without a variable speed processor.  We were wrong.  The Kitchenaid base is heavy and stable while still conserving counter space.  The 4-cup mini bowl is perfect for so many jobs, like sauces and dressings, that just don't need the large bowl.  The motor is rather quiet in comparison to other processors we've used.  The chrome is clean looking and complimentary to our decor.  Clean up is easy in that we've used the mini bowl and the design kept the large bowl perfectly clean.  We've orderd the blade box but have not received it yet.  We've added Kitchenaid to our list of brands that we trust"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Beautiful and sturdy,I love these glasses! The design is simple and beautiful. I've had them for almost a year and haven't broken any of them.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,The happy middle ground,"US cookware seems to fall into two categories - there's the basic stuff from Revere and Farberware that your mother used (great for heating up Campbells soup and frying Shake-n-Bake chicken), and there's the $$OHMYGOD$$ stuff from All-Clad and similar (actually usable to make sauces and sautes). "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Best Litter box Available, but could use minor improvements.","Overall this is a great litter box. It's so quick (1-2 min) and easy to clean that I clean it more often (at least once a day), and it's not a gross process because you never have to touch the litter or inside of the box. So now I only need 1 box for 2 cats. It is simply the best litter box out there, but it still could use a few minor improvements. First the latches that hold it together are flimsy, mine haven't broken but may in the future, but these could easily be replaced with a bolt and a wing nut. Second clumps occasionally stick to the box, but a coating of Pam on the plastic or an occasional smack on the bottom of the box helps. Third since 1/3 of the box is taken up by the cleaning grate/scoop I highly recommend the large size box unless you have a petite cat. Fourth you have to use a good clumping litter or it won't work, I use Arm & Hammer Unscented, because it's cheap and effective. Overall it is a great box and I would buy it again or recommend it to a friend"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 9,5.0,Pleased with Kitchenaid,"I bought the Red model and have not had a problem with chipping paint like other reviews stated. I do wish the timer went to an hour, but most items were baked for under an hour. I had my first cake get too brown on top, but after adjusting the temp. and baking time, it baked beatifully. I have found that things bake quicker in this oven than my large oven, which I appreciate. I do wish it wasn't so expensive, but I bought it to match my Kitchenaid cookware set which I also am very happy with"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,Maybe I expected too much?,"I was very excited about the prospect of silicone bakeware. Silicone seems to be the wonder material of the 21st century, yet, I have been disappointed with the results. The tube pan is very bendy and when I giggled it a bit to see if my cake was loose enough to remove, I wound up with a crack right down the middle. When I got my cake out of the pan (easily), the center was as white as when it went in the oven. I'm used to having the centers brown up with my regular tube pan."

It is truly unbelievable how much hair and dirt your old sweeper missed.  Try this one once and you will be convinced.  My only negative comments are, 1) the instruction manual should be a little more descriptive and helpful, especially about the use of the tools, and 2) it picks up hair so well that you have to cut it from the brushes every few times you use it.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,two out of three ain't bad,"You get a very good bowl scraper with a unique shape that works. Also, the rectangular scraper has a small ridge around the perimeter of its otherwise flat profile. This works great for the required intermittent scraping down the bowl of electric mixers (even while it's running). Other tools are two thick or have rounded noses. The spoonula with the set is short and being multi-material becomes a cleaning issue"
kitchen & housewares,37 of 39,5.0,Best wok for gas cooking,"This is really the best wok if you are cooking on a gas stove.  Flat bottom woks are really not going to give you the best flavor, and many woks readily available in the US are too heavy to lift and shake the food while cooking - which is the way a wok should be used. This wok is round-bottomed and light, and costs much less than almost all of the other woks on offer"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"The strainer in the lid is a good idea, but . . .","I purchased this saucepan specifically because it has a straining/pouring feature in the lid.  The idea is great.  However, it isn't quite as effective as I thought it would be.  This is a 3-quart saucepan that holds alot of water, especially when you are cooking pasta or potatoes.  When you go to pour the water out the pot is heavy to lift and you have to lift it and hold it at a certain angle to get the water to drain out.  Sometimes you think all the water has drained but it hasn't. If you are making mashed potatoes and all the water didn't drain, you have a problem you didn't expect.  Maybe it just takes getting used to.  I like the saucepan and it came in red which I wanted but trying to use the straining/pouring feature is harder than I expected.   "

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Almost perfect,"If cared for properly, this is just about the perfect non-stick pan.  So long as you avoid really high temperatures, use proper utensils and clean it properly, it should last forever.  Like all non-stick, it heats more slowly than regular cookware, but the Calphalon ""Professional"" line has enough metal to spread the heat properly, avoiding hot spots.  Slide it into the oven (at temperatures below 459 F, please) and it also performs well.  Why four stars instead of five?  The handle is not well designed and needs to be a bit heavier for proper balance.  (Hey, I am a tough grader!"

I am very sorry for all of you that had the ""coffee explosion.""  Mine has worked twice a day for a couple of years now with only one coffee explosion and no other problems.  I am going to order another one so when my little coffee maker does finally give it up I will have a replacement"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Pretty Pattern but quality is below average,"Ordered 2 sets because I trust the Pfaltzgraff name and thought the pattern was pretty.  Quality is below average.  Not one of the bowls in the 2 sets was perfectly round, so they dont stack well.  Flatware seems to leave marks on the plates and I recently discovered a flaw on the  mugs.  There is a hairline crack next to the handle on 2 of the mugs.  The finish (green) in the bowls and mugs is also a problem. "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,"Pretty darn good, still have to be a little careful","I got this and the Lodge 2 Piece Hot Handle Holder Set at the same time, and this product is a lot better.  It's more substantial, thicker, and because it's thicker (although the same size) it fits the handle more snugly, therefore less slipping around.  "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,T-Fal better than Rowenta,"After buying Rowenta irons for years and spending much more than I wanted for an iron I decided to try a T-Fal.  Why?  Because after a few years my Rowenta always started spotting while using the steam.  My T-Fal is shapped different than the Rowenta and it is easier to get between buttons and tight spots, i.e. cuffs, collars.  The steam is excellent and I can only hope it last longer than the Rowenta as far as years down the road not spewing out dirty staining water!  The T-Fal was 1/2 the price of my previous Rowenta irons"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great Cookware - NO RIVETS TO CLEAN AROUND!!,"I searched everywhere for welded handles and yet didn't want to sacrifice quality. This little cookware set has it all (encapsulated aluminum bottoms, 18/10, glass lids)! And for the price, you can't beat it! We just came from a home show and this cookware had everything the expensive sets do! I've used it to cook with and it's great. (I didn't realize though, that you should treat your ss cookware gently and try to keep the scratches down, and then it cleans up almost as easy as teflon."

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Disappointed,"I believe the box and advertising should have held more information.  Although I did manage to get some soft serve ice cream, it took much longer than the instructions said.  Following their time schedule, I had soup.  I didn't mind the extra time so much as the fact that every single recipe included was made with powdered milk.  I could taste the overwhelming powdered milk taste no matter what I tried.  I contacted the company about finding different recipes and they said not to use any other recipes than the ones included, and that they had no other recipes available.  I wanted an ice cream maker where I can have a variety of recipes, and one where fruits, nuts or candies can be added.  Nowhere does it say how limited this machine is until you open it up after purchase.  I'm selling mine for 50 cents in a yard sale, and will chalk it up to an expensive mistake"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Our family has 4 of these,"When we heard that the cost of electricity in our area (very hot and humid in the summer) would be rising 9%, I bought 2 of these at the beginning of the summer so that our air conditioning costs would not be outrageous.  After using them a few days, I ordered 2 more.  They keep the air circulating nicely.  Our dogs like to sleep in front of them.  They are much more quiet than our box fan.  They fit in corners of rooms very nicely; space efficiency is very important in our household.  Our total electric bill went down compared to last year, even with the rate increase, because we were able to set the thermostat a little higher and stay comfortable using these fans.  I think that they will pay for themselves over time"

kitchen & housewares,0 of 2,5.0,lemonade for everyone,What better way to kick off summer than to review lemonade?  Lemonade is the juice of the Gods.  Did you ever wonder what God's intention for lemons were when he created them?  Think about it.  When God invented lemons did he do so because he thought humans would have no problem peeling a lemon and sucking the bitter sweet juice STRAIGHT from a lemon?  Or did he create lemons because he knew people would be intelligent enough to mix lemons with water to have ourselves a refreshing drink?  They say you should never assume (and that includes Gods) so I don't know WHAT to think.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Love these,"Just love this set of pots and pans. I have Wolfgang puck and I truly like these better. I can actualy fry an egg with a teaspoon of margerine and flip it like nonstick. You just have to heat the pan first but use medium heat then heat your margerine until sizzeling and add your egg. To test the pans I even scrambled the egg when I flipped it and it will slide out just like nonstick. I love deep sides on the sauce pans, and the feel of the handels very good if your grip isn't so great. I have fibromylgia and sometimes I can't grip well or lift heavy items. These are just the ticket not flimsy but not to heavy. They clean beautifuly just use alittle bar keepers friend if you get a bad stick, or starch starts to build up. Just remember to turn down the heat when cooking and you will be fine. I also don't use metal utenciles I like the silicone ones"

kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Three strikes and it was gone,"This knife gave a performance roughly equal to what I paid for it.  Bread knives aren't really precision cutting tools, they basically need to be able to get a good grip on a hard surface and not make too many crumbs.  On both these counts this knife was not successful.  The blade is rather thick and as a result converts a lot of whatever it cuts to crumbs.  More importantly, the serrations did not stay sharp and had a tendency to slip.  After three people, myself included, got cut as a result of the knife slipping on hard bread or a bagel that was the end.  I replaced the knife with a Suisin bread knife, which, while more expensive and a little hard to find, is far better as a bread knife"

This soup pot is one of the best. It is sturdy, cleans well and heats fast and evenly. I also like the fact it comes with a lifetime guarantee. I will pass it down to my children. I've made soup, stew, beef burgandy, chicken & noodles to name a few. And they will remember it as the soup pot that mom and grandma cooked many delicious meals. The only negative aspect perhaps would be that it is heavy, because it is made of cast iron."

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,Great deal for the price,"As long as the price stays cheap then it's worth it! (under $12-$13) Great little first-time juicer...my kids love juicing their own oranges. Don't be in a hurry for the juice as it juices rather slowly and all juice will be very pulpy whether you have the little plastic &quot;catcher&quot; set to catch pulp or not plus doesn't do the greatest job getting all the juice out. Pulp builds up fast and top 3 parts have to be constantly dumped and rinsed off..pitcher part constantly slips out of &quot;lock&quot; position and the whole thing flies apart when handling it but not when juicing. Has a convenient wind-in cord holder underneath. The annoyances are minor (sound worse than they actually are as it's very simple to use and easy to clean) considering you are paying so little for this cute little thing. Worth the money for the occasional, not-so-serious juicer"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Sturdier than it looks and really keeps tea hot,"I love the double wall glasses and bought the teapot when I saw it was available.  I use the teapot and the glasses together--a great pair.  I get four glasses of tea from the pot, and the last one is still at an enjoyable drinking temperature.  I don't use a tea cozy, and this pot is better than any ceramic one I have used.  The glass is thin and certainly looks fragile; possibly not the best thing to have in a house with small children.  But I've had the glasses well over a year, and the teapot several months, with no breakage.  And the teapot does sit out on my counter.  Laboratory glassware is just tougher than you think--it is not lead crystal.  The infuser works well also, and it is very nice to be able to stop the brewing without having to dispose immediately of the tea leaves or their container.  For me, it's been worth the price"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,2.0,Design flaws disappoint,"I bought this garlic press because of the Kitchenaid name and because I got tired of processing so many cloves of garlic with just a chef's knife.  When we got it, my husband (who shares cooking duty) was delighted at how it felt in his hands and at how much time it saved him.  I was disappointed with the size - a little too large for my average-size female hands. Design flaw #1.  I rallied and continued to use it (with both hands) for about a year and a half.  Yesterday, the handle cracked and broke off.  The metal portion of the press does not extend down the handle. Design flaw #2.  I was pressing one small clove so I'm sure the break was not due to misuse.  I'm going to follow the America's Test Kitchen recommendation and get a Zyliss next time"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A real time saver.,I've been using this item for preparing pureed soups and it works beautifully.  So much easier to clean (and use) than a full-sized blender. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,great sheets!,"I'm a student at a massage therapy school and i only have two sheet sets, so i wash these at least twice a week and they aren't showing any wear at all (i've had them for about 2 months).  I don't really care for the color, but I get complements on my sheets often.  The order arrived a week earlier than I had expected."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,wanted one for years,"I have wanted a kitchen aid mixer for years and finally gave in.  I love it.  The only thing I did not like was making bread with the dough hook.  I have only made one thing with the hook so I need to give it several more tries.....Georgia in Port Richey, F"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Grill for college student,"Wonderful grill, perfect for the college student,"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 24,5.0,Coffee lovers dream tool !!  Awesome !  ,"I must admit, when I first heard of these immersion frothers, I was very skeptical.  I had tried many frothers, cappuccino machines with built in frothers (work great first 2 times, then they always clog) and plunger frothers  (can you say carpal tunnel syndrome??) etc.  After much time AND much effort, there was very little reward, almost no froth and much frustration, not to mention cleanup.  I tried the plunger types repeatedly to the point where I was sure I'd have blisters.  Did I  mention having to disassemble & clean all the frother parts after?  :o)"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,One of the most colorful and versatile pattern dinnerware,I find the dinnerware to be fantastic!  I was looking for a pattern I could use different colored tablecloths and glassware.  I found it!  The dinnerware can be used for everyday and it looks great on a formal table also.  I got two for the price of one. I can see myself getting years of use from this dinnerware
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Not made for sweet potatoes.,"We've been eating more sweet potatoes and yams as healthy alternative to white potatoes. Usually I slice them and drizzle with olive oil and bake, so I thought slicing them as fries would be more appealing to kids (and less expensive than the frozen ones at the health food co-op). I used this disc in my Cuisinart Prep 11 plus.  It turns out that yams and sweet potatoes are alot more firm than white potatoes. The light gold colored ones sliced up a little better than the dark red ones, but both colors were a bit of a hassle, getting stuck in the blade and jamming it up."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Pooped out after 2 months,"I received this in November for my office and thought the design was terrible but it boiled water and I hate to return products. It broke today, 2 and half months later."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Working so far,"I read about Zymox on a vet's website regarding chronic ear infections. My black Lab is a rescue from the street and she had chronic ear infections when I found her. The usual story of rounds of antibiotics, including expensive Baytril, without resolution of her problem. It's been almost a month now and her ears are improving. I find that I cannot skip a day or the gooey black gunk recurs, but if done daily she has little goo. I plan on continuing every day and I hope we can clear her ears up before swimming season returns. Zymox has certainly been an improvement over antibiotics"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,1.0,Good Concept Cheap materials,"This is a good concept.  It does make bulky items like blankets and comforters more compact for storage for the winter.  However 2 of the 4 bags we bought didn't hold a vacuum.  The plastic is thin and easily tears.   Look for some products for storage once the patent is up and a few companies can make competing products.  As for Space Bag, this product is a cheaply made loser.  I won't waste my time and money on it again"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,1.0,Unhappy with product,I received two shipments for this product.  They were both received broken into many pieces.  The dishes had no protection during shipment.  Please notify shipping department to pack these items correctly!
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,1.0,Poor quality,"This knife set for a new product, is very diappointing. I'm returning mine. Out of the box it looked cheap. I agree with other reviewer that the little plastic inserts on the block don't stay in. You have to peal if off the knife everytime you pull a knife out, to put it back on the block-CC needs to try some glue to hold them in. CC makes much nicer sets for less money-this would be a hassle to use to use and why pay more a poorer set"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 12,1.0,I couldn't believe it . . . ,". . . while cooking in my sister's kitchen last week I reached for the ""typical"" whisk as I was preparing a custard for bread pudding - the mixture was thick and it wasn't going very well.  I then tried her ball whisk and was utterly amazed at the difference!  Since that experience I have searched every basic and gourment kitchen store in my area for this wonderful kitchen tool . . . no luck.  Thanks Amazon.com - I can ALWAYS rely on you"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Amazing,I didn't know juicers were capable of such intense juicing.  It REALLY does juice whole apples in seconds.  I give the Breville JE900 a big thumbs up

kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,5.0,A Gift For My Friends,"My friends have a wonderful house, but the oldest (dullest) set of kitchen knives I have ever seen. I bought these for them as a gift and they were blown away. Best of all, they thought I spent a TON of money."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works great. Great Price.,"Our basement smells much better after putting this in. I've had it for several months and just now I have to clean the filter. We have two Ionic Breezes and this one stands up to them easily. Save your money and get this one instead. It's a little less streamlined, but who cares"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,Waring blendors are the best.,"My Grandmother had a Waring Blendor. My Mother had a Waring Blendor. Why did I have to BUY one instead of ""borrowing"" one of theirs? Because they gave them away to get ""lighter"", i.e., cheap, plastic blenders, back in the early eighties. Big mistake. My grandmother died before she had to replace hers, but my mother is on her third cheap blender now. I expect my Waring Blendor to last the rest of my life. Fortunately, I was able to get my grandmother's Waring Blendor Cookbook from the forties. The current model still has the powerful motor, heavy glass container, super-duper cord and top-quality switch that my grandmother's had, sixty-odd years ago."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,4.0,Decent for the money,"I purchased this for my girlfriend who is a teacher to use to time things such as tests or other activities. Having two timers seemed to be a good idea. The first one we got from Amazon had a broken start/stop button which was no fun. Amazon shipped us another via 2 day shipping and this new one works just fine. However I do have to say the quality isnt the greatest. It is not junk by any means but I worry about the buttons breaking after heavy use. But for the cost of this thing I do think it is worth it. If you want a cheap timer that will do the job I would get this one. The magnetic clip on the back is very sturdy and is a nice feature. One other nice thing is that it has very easy to read and use, instructions on the back of the package"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Dog Door Bell,"It takes a little patience to get the dog to use it, at first she thought is was a treat machine, but eventually she realized it meant go outside. Works very well."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 31,2.0,Never Get UNSEASONED!,"never buy an unseasoned castiron pot! what a rusty, sticky, disaster! baking it with oil as direction say did not do anything, and really, it is just a waste of money. you would not eat out of a pot that looks this way"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 19,5.0,Bake Perfect Cakes,"Chicago Metallic Commericial bakeware is excellent. These 8-inch round cake pans are very heavyweight and give even baking results. I rub a bit of vegetable shortening on these pans and then line the bottom with a circle of waxed paper. One can dust some flour over the shortening, too. For an 8-inch layer cake, I like to divide the cake batter between three 8-inch round cake pans. Make sure they are staggered on the oven racks for the best baking results"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent Quality,"I'm usually cooking for one, so I use this pan mostly with a steamer insert.  It's a good, heavy pot with a stay cool handle.  Heats very evenly and quickly."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,I use it all the time and keep finding new uses,"This is a terrific tool for any cook.  I thought my husband and I were nuts for buying such an expensive pancake griddle.  It makes terrific pancakes but I use it all time, on the stove and inside the oven to grill and roast everything from asparagus to zucchini with stops on the way for chicken, salmon and potatoes.  It heats quickly, evenly and holds the heat for a long time.  Can be cleaned with little effort"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great Skillet,This is a great product.  We have had others from years ago.  It produces excellent results and has been used and used.  It is very easy to use and convenient
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,GREAT LITTLE HEATER!,I brought this heater for a bedroom that does not have storm windows on any of the 3 windows.  Room temp now gets HOT and I have to turn the heater off and that is only on the lowest setting.  No need to sit directly in front of it either as it heats the entire room - quickly.
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Cinnabar is a beautiful table piece,I gave this piece to my wife for Mothers Day - it was a big hit. The cinnabar has a hot look that makes hot food even more appealing on the table. It matches our Arts and Crafts era home
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,4.0,Pretty Nice Device,"Just got the 9.6 volt model V9610 about a week ago. Overall I like it a lot. It might seem a little large at first, but is handy to use and well balanced. Suction on the high setting is impressive, while the normal setting still provides plenty for most things. Emptying it out is easy, as is cleaning the filter. Be sure to read and understand the instructions for charging it before use. The manual says it'll run 10 minutes between charges. Seems to do better than that to me. It's a lot easier to pull out of the craddle when wall mounted, so I suggest you use the supplied screws and drywall anchors. I took off one star for that and the switch being a little on the stiff side. I definitely recommend this model over the lesser powered ones for the good suction"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,5.0,Cameo Aluminum & Stainless Steel Cleaner,This is the best cleaner for stainless steel pots and pans! Just a quick swipe around the inside of the pan is all that is needed to remove water marks and cooking stains. It keeps aluminum sinks shiny without alot of scrubbing and doesn't leave scratch marks
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,1.0,Don't Bother,"I bought this right after I got my Kitchen-Aid, and a week later went out and bought a manual pasta roller for $39.00. As others have said, the noodles stick together, and you don't get as good a consistency as you do by rolling them out. Go with a roller, not this"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Not as durable as I'd hoped,"When I first got this chopper, I was really pleased -- it is efficient, easy to clean and actually fun to use. But the plastic disc that keeps food from going up into the blades got ""chopped"" by the blades the 3rd or 4th time I used it, rendering it useless. Now it's in the trash. Disappointing on the durability side of things, to say the least"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,4.0,Very good unit,I was leary of spending this much on a grinder. But I really like coffee and noticed that my home brew wasn't quite up to par with Pete's (coffee house where I get my beans). Now my home brew coffee is as good as it is when brewed at Pete's.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,Great Camp Cooker,"We took this unit camping, and cooked most of our meals over our campfire. Chili, Pineapple upside down cake, spaghetti, etc. It was fantastic. [..."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,this thing rocks!,I kept trying to find this coffee maker on discount but finally bit the bullet and got it from Amazon (free shipping made it worthwhile).
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,KitchenAid Food Grinder,It is so nice to be able to grind meat and things easily with this attachment.  I thoroughly enjoy my KitchenAid mixer and my food grinder.  Very good product
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Bundt Cake Saver,I love it! it is prefect for the cakes I bake for my friends. I will be ordering another one soon
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great thin blanket,"This was exactly what I was looking for; a thin, light-weight blanket that keeps its color through washes.  Great blanket and very vibrant color.  Also cannot beat the price"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 19,5.0,Great heater!  And safe,"This is a wonderful unit.  I have a chilly apartment, and don't trust my wall heater, which is gas-based, prone to malfunctioning, and has a metal exterior that becomes extremely hot:  I bought this space heater as an alternative.  This Vornado heater warmed the room better than I expected, and the temperature control is fantastic.  It's very quiet, but if you're a light sleeper, it might bother you a bit."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,The quintessential iron!,"This is the greatest iron I've ever used, without a doubt. It steams like crazy at the gentlest touch of a button, the controls are clear, the cords are plenty long, the steam reservoir is generous, clearly shows how much water you've got left, and easy to fill. The iron is heavy enough to iron the clothes without your having to supply all the pressure, but light enough that it's easy to use and not tiring. It's expensive, yes, but if you are tired of ironing with irons that don't get the wrinkles out, then it's worth the price. It also fits perfectly on the Rowenta Professional ironing board (see my review of that, too), although the cords are easily long enough for the base to just sit on a nearby table. I've tried steaming only one hanging garment, and the results were disappointing, but one effort is not a fair assessment. All in all, I highly recommend this iron!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,The Large Spoon I Really Use,"One of my biggest issues with Kitchen utensils is that so many of them are flimsy - and when you are stirring something heavy they bend or break.  But not with this spoon.  It's durable and stiff, yet sized well with a remarkably comforable grip, so it doesn't slip during use.  Other products in this line are great too, and also benefit from this strength and build quality.  I have several as a result, and count them as one of my most frequently used items for stews or other similar dishes.  A good purchase you will likely use for a lifetime"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Not for regulars...,"A little about my coffee drinking habits.  I usually drink 1-2 pots of coffee a day.  I used to drink only Maxwell House Master Blend.  Recently it seemed to be going bad faster than I could drink it, so I decided to give this coffee maker a shot.  It was given to us by my mother-in-law. "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Very Good Product,"The only complaint I have about this machine is the temp settings are preset and only 275, 340, & 375.  I would have prefered to be able to adjust the temp as I see fit, other than that it's fantastic"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,Beautiful But Dangerous: Buy For Display Use Only,"The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Durable for any use,"The ""Fruit Salad Bowls"" are beautiful at any occasion at any age.  It is durable and displays wonderfully at formal to informal dinners.  You can't ask for more from this product"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,cosmos,"I originally thought $25.00 was too much - after seeing and using these beautiful glasses I am very pleased,satisfied and happy with my purchase"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love my tea mug!,"This is the best tea mug! The lid keeps the tea hot while it's steeping, when the tea is ready the lid becomes the setting place for the infuser -- no mess! The mug itself is sturdy and the color is vibrant. It's so great that I had to buy some for friends."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Work as well as my more expensive pans!,I have not had any of the problems that were listed. I have some very expensive baking pans and have had the same results as with the Calphalon I purchased from Target approximately two years ago. I also have a convection oven. The only thing I have to do is reduce the baking times. The surface has remained as non-stick as when I used it the first time. In addition I am purchsing another set to leave at my home in the US. I hate not having them with me
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Burned out after 6 months,"I replaced it with a Melitta Express Kettle, also 1.7 Litres, which seems to have a nicer balance, and definitely a better base arrangement, since the connector is in the middle and you can put the kettle down on it in any orientation. Seems to boil faster, too, but that may be illusory"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,4.0,No Subject,This set is great for your standard baking needs. It's durable and easy to use. Great product
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,I enjoy my cookers,"This is my second slow cooker, I got a 1.5qt but found it was too small for making stuff for potlucks at work so I bought this one. It's a nice size. I keep it in the trunk of my car and if we're feeling like making something at work it's readily available. I bought this one because of it's looks. I like the black crock and unlike another person's comment, it's not difficult to clean (I don't have a dishwasher). There are much more slow cooker recipes than you think. I just made some stuffing for a work Thanksgiving potluck that turned out pretty good! On Thanksgiving, it'll save on some stove space:"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect for Pasta,"I have to agree with most of the others - these bowls are great. I wish I had been lucky enough to find them for $4.99 like the one buyer, however, at $11.99, I'm still happy. The bowl arrived perfect. It has performed perfectly. The color is lovely. I have 9 different color variations going on in my cabinet, so, even if there was an inconsistency in color, it wouldn't matter. The stamp is clearly marked on bottom, but, that isn't why I buy Fiesta. I buy Fiesta because I know they will survive my 4 boys. I suspect that given the number of pieces they churn out each year, some markings will be more pronounced than others"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,"Poor quality, no customer support","I purchased a Honeywell Enviracare Tower Fan on 9/2/05, and it operated very nicely at first. However, it stopped working completely within 5 days. There is no valuable customer support information on Honeywell's web site--only a form requesting information for inquiry. I would never purchase another of these products"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,"If you eat a lot of rice, buy this!","Prepares rice perfectly every time.  Amazingly easy to clean.  It is a large cooker, though, and the main asset of a rice cooker is keeping rice fresh.  So, be forewarned, lots 'o rice!  The manual insists that the rice be washed prior to cooking, but I've noticed little or no difference in the quality of rice either way.  It's perfect no matter what I do to trip it up"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Now I'm a Believer,"When my girlfriend recieved this for her birthday (she's a long time believer in the Cuisinart) I knew it would be an upgrade from my modest hand me down food processor, but I was blown away.  First off it weighs a ton, which really means something with motors.  The weight was put to good use, as it effortlessly mowed through food, and it did so with a delicacy that makes food so enjoyable (I ate enough pulverized crap as an infant, so I appreciate foods with texture, and the sharp blades make sure things stay the way they should).  I never thought the difference between a regular food processor and a Cuisinart would be so dramatic, but it is.  The 7 cup capacity is easily sufficient for a couple adults (I imagine you could throw in a few kids for good measure), and the included blades tend to most uses.  It can allegedly do a good job mixing cakes and kneading dough, and based on its overall performance, I believe it, but I'd rather use my Kitchenaid mixer for that"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Gorgeous!!!,"I just can't rave enough about these beautiful dishes!  I love all the bright colors, the fact that they are all different patterns in the same colors keeps me from getting bored of looking at the same thing everyday. I really think they are the most beautiful and fun dishes I have ever owned. Check out the adorable book that goes with the set! These are on my highly recommended list if you love the look of Tuscany,the Mediteranian or just something truly unique, you will fall in love with these gorgeous dishes"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,what a beauty!,"    pan- seared a WHOLE chicken oven roaster in this skillet yesterday and what a beautiful crust it gave that bird!!! Not with any other pan EVER did I get such results. Then I transferred it to the oven, unlike before I would have to transfer into another long baking dish... the chicken would never stay intact and I would have more dirty dishes to wash! "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent grilling performance!,"I chose this pan based on the Cooks Illustrated review, and boy do they know what they are talking about. This pan is awesome! I've used it to grill fajita strips and steaks and it works perfectly.  Beautiful grill marks just like on a real grill, great conduction so it heats up evenly all the way across the pan, and the nonstick surface makes it clean up super quick and easy. One of my favorite pans! Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Easy to use, great product!",I have had this coffee maker for over a year now and still love it!  I haven't had the issue of coffee tasting funny from sitting in the plastic.  I have had a thermos style coffee maker in the past and I wasn't happy with it.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Cuisinart Chefs Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 12 piece cookware ser,"  After 40 years of marriage, I have finally found cookware that lives up to its description.  I enjoy cooking with these pots.  They cook evenly and are a breeze to clean.  The handles do not heat and feel balanced and safe while handling them.I even like the glass lids that allow me to see what's happening without lifting the lid."
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Inconsistent,"This torch seems to work just fine about one time out of twenty or so.  When it does work, the flame is long and easy to control, but most of the time, I find that it tends to randomly shut off, as the reviewer below described, or worse, it just sort of runs out of gas.  The flame will start out fine, then over the course of ten seconds or so, it runs completely out of juice.  You can fill it ready to burst, and it still does this.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a hand torch that works any better, but if you're in the market, look around and try these out in person if you can.  I think the next one I buy will be one of those huge industrial-strength models from the hardware store. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"beautiful machine, pretty good coffee","I purchased this coffee maker to replace a busted Capresso. It's a bit pricey for what it does, but it does make good coffee. I was a little dissapointed with all the plastic internals, since from the pictures (and in person) it looks very expensive in a cast metal and stainless steel way"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Bought this set after reading several reviews...,This is a great item in many ways except for one:
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,Don't buy if you're going to juice everyday.,"I bought this item on 10/22/06, the first week I loved it but within 3 weeks of jucing 3-4 times daily the blade is dull.  I normally juice apple(cored), pear(cored), celery, carrots, grapes, Kale or Chard, red peppers.  I have followed the directions from day one and have even tried their suggested vinegar soak on the filter basket to no avail. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I don't understand all the negative reviews,"I have owned one of these little wonders for over five years.  During that time I have replaced the lightbulb one time, which is the extent of the maintenance or repairs that the light has required.  For people who are complaining that the light feels ""flimsy"", have you tried tightening the series of screws that allow you to adjust the tension between various parts of the light?  It's designed to allow for this sort of adjustment, but if you never tighten the screws they will eventually get loose.  Imagine that!  It's a moving part!  Seriously, maybe they've switched to a different supplier (although I doubt it), but my light is a joy.  It has proven durable over countless trips, moves, and drops.  It provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse to sleep undisturbed beside you.  Plus, unlike so many designs on the market, it is VERY lightweight.  Some designs inexplicably have the batteries housed in the unit, so that the batteries weigh down your book while you read.  I just don't understand all the negative reviews of this product.  The only thing I can suggest is: try tightening those screws periodically.  It will make a world of difference"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I couldn't be happier with my food scale!,This food scale is perfect for me. It takes up very little space on the counter and looks nice enough that I leave it sitting out for daily use.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Wonderful for slow mornings,"The ESE system is wonderful and the Illy coffee is amazing. I can pull a decent shot of espresso anytime I want, especially during mornings when I can barely get out of bed. Instead of having to blend, grind, pull, taste, wash, scrub, repeat; all I have to do is put the pod in the portafilter, pull the shot and enjoy. The entire process takes less than 40 seconds and allows me the espresso experience without all the barista duties."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,5.0,Blue Monster,Love it and don't know how I baked without it. Shipped fast and is all I expected plus some
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Review from your everyday Joe,"I am no professional chef, but I do enjoy cooking.  This knife does indeed work wonders (as far as cutting through things effortlessly goes).  "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,5.0,A Step Above,Very happy with this toaster.  Having a LED readout for settings and the timer is surprisingly handy.  Well worth the extra money
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Awesome Iron - yeah colored Green!,"After using a lighter iron for years, this iron's splendid. It irons away creases from tough cotton shirts with ease. As an iron it does the job extremely well. And for the price this one really rocks."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent item!!! Excellent Price!!!!,"My old iron broke, so I need a new one. I do a lot of sewing and wanted a nice iron with out paying $100 for iron, Crazy!! I found this one and I am very happy with my purchase. It is perfect for all my pressing needs from delicate fabric to heavy fabrics. MaryAn"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,No problems with this organizer,"I was surprised to read that the other reviewers here had a bad experience with the customer service and with the quality of this desktop organizer. I received it well-packaged and in perfect condition, and it works great!! I've been paying my bills consistently on time for the first time ever--I hate to admit-- but that's how helpful it has been to have this. And it's not unattractive on my desk. The only issue for me is that it's a bit too big for my space. But the dimensions are listed, so you can measure it before buying (which I did not do)"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Good coffee but bad quirks,"While we were pleased with the quality of the coffee produced, we are totally fed up with its leaking and dumping water.  We live in a rural area and at least a couple of times a year the power goes out.  This coffee pot has a 'vacation' setting that you use when on vacation. If you unplug appliances when you travel you'll return to a counter full of water and an empty coffee maker.  Unfortunately, if the power goes out, the coffee maker decides that it has been unplugged and dumps its contents all over the counter.  "
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,Disappointed,The idea of a thermal carafe sounded good.  This one is very attractive. I didn't realize there was no way to reheat the coffee.  I preheated the carafe with hot water before brewing but it failed to keep the coffee warm thru the second cup. As a result I was constantly pouring out pots of luke warm coffee.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Wow!  What fantastic quality!,"I've bought lots of baking pans in the past.  None of them, no matter what popular brand, can hold a candle to these.  OMG are they heavy and durable!!!  The weight isn't too much, but definitely enough to let you know these pans aren't going to warp like all the others.  The handles are incredibly ergonimical & comfortable.  I just love them!  I am so excited ... especially with the Christmas baking month ahead.  You won't be disappointed with these pans"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Love it!,We just got this coffee pot at Costco for $99 and LOVE IT! It takes a little more work getting set up than our old Mr. Coffee pot. You have to clean the grinding components each time for optimal taste - that is why I only gave it 4 stars. But the extra time is worth it. The coffee tastes amazing and it is ready when we wake up in the morning. I haven't experienced any leaking problems like I have heard about
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,4.0,good knives,"I am glad that I purchased these knives.  They are sharp and appear to be a quality set.  I'm not so sure that I care for the steak knives, they are severely serrated, making them somewhat difficult to clean.  All cleaning cloths gets stuck in the blade.  The smooth blades are great.  Worth the price paid"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,"Does what it says it does, and well","I was tempted to buy a less expensive hand ice crusher, but then read some of the disasterous reviews of those, and opted instead for this ice crusher based on most of the positive feedback.  Knowing that it would not make ""shaved ice"" before I acquired it has kept my expectations realistic, and it performs exactly as I thought it would, actually better.  A friend thought I paid hundreds of dollars for this since it looks very no-nonsense and professional.  It crushes the ice into random chunks ranging from pea-sized to marble sized, even though I feed it pretty large cubes from a tray.  "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Gizmo Grater,"Unfortunately, I didn't read any reviews on the Gizmo Grater.  Had I read anything about it before trying it out, I would have not bought any.  I bought a total of 6 graters to give as gifts.  Two told me it is not good for soft cheeses.  We use a lot of cheddar cheese for tacos.  What a waste of money.  It worked very good with parmesan cheese which is hard.  That is why I gave it 2 stars.  Other than that, thumbs down.  Perhaps I should send the two back that I haven't given as presents"

While I don't use them to chill a room-temperature bottle of water, (I don't find that to be as effective;) I do use them to keep an already chilled bottle of water cold longer.  I am not a soda drinker; I am a bottled water drinker.  When I leave the house, I grab water and, especially in the summer, the chillers really do work!  "

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,I love this measuring cup!,"This is one of those kichen gadgets that once I bought it, I don't know how I got along without it! For me, the very best feature of this tool is the ability to measure sticky, hard to measure ingredients like peanut butter, molasses, mayonnaise, etc without any problem at all. The way it works is you slide the plunger-like insert down to the appropriate measuring line (for example, if you wanted to measure 1 cup of mayo, then you would slide it down to the line that says 1 cup) then you fill the inside to the brim with the ingredient, then you turn the tool upside down and plunge the ingredients out into your bowl. Like magic, every last bit of the ingredient comes falling into the bowl without sticking to the sides at all. If there's any remaining on the top, then you can swipe it away with a knife and VOILA! Anyone who has tried to measure honey or molasses in a standard dry measure knows how frustrating this process can be. "
kitchen & housewares,19 of 21,1.0,Not what I hoped for based on other reviews,"I have had a borner slicer (plastic mandoline) for years and love it except that the plastic is slightly flexible and so it has started to crack and bend when I use it.  I have been wanting to upgrade it to a stainless steel mandoline forever, but couldn't afford one.  Well, when I saw the price on this one and read the reviews I was very excited to get my new mandoline.  Boy was I dissappointed.  I found that ALL of the negative comments that I found in various reviews below were true plus some.  Too bad they weren't posted until AFTER I purchased mine which I am promptly returning to Amazon."

kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,"Good overall design, whistle fails","I purchased one of these kettles a couple of years ago and generally like it, especially the spout that opens automatically when you pour.  However the whistle is not durable.  I sent my first two back to OXO due to the whistle failing.  They graciously replaced the units with new ones, the second of which had a new design for the whistle.  However, it too failed within a couple of months.  I have followed the directions of not filling the kettle with too much water and only using medium heat to no avail."

The set I received is fully polished (easier to keep clean), with very good attention to detail, in between the tines of the forks and the pierced openings on the spoons are the only areas not fully polished. All the handles are solid, half round on all the items except the knives, which feature a slab sided oval contour."

I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the pitcher is.  Sea Mist is much more beautiful in person, and so is the pitcher.  It not only matches my other Fiestaware pieces, but is an item that I can use in any room of the house.  I can see it displayed on the mantle, in a bedroom, the bathroom, as well as the kitchen.  If only Fiestaware would continue Sea Mist....I could order all the sizes of the pitcher and have a really nice display"

kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Power Wok,"This electric wok is fantastic. Just disregard all you've heard about how electric woks don't match up. The Breville EW30XL is different and it rates 5 stars by many people for good reasons. This wok is extremely well made and should last a lifetime. It gets so hot on the highest setting, that it melted the end of a plastic wok turner I purchased to use with it (use good quality hardwood and toss quickly). It's non-stick coating is there to stay and because of it, you use less or even no oil (be sure to use appropriate oils). Peanut oil is a perfect choice. This is a high quality wok that you will enjoy for years to come"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,The Best Mixer!,I purchased this mixer a couple of months ago. I have used it several times and love how it works.  I had purchased the mixer based on Kitchen Aids reputation and on reviews submitted by others. I purchased the Artisan model over the larger model based on those reviews.  I am very pleased with the Artisan model so far. The reviews I read were right on the money. This mixer works as advertised. I would highly recommend purchasing the Artisan model Kitchen Aid Mixer
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Annoying Settings,"This deep fryer does a good job frying food.  There is plenty of room in the basket and it is relatively easy to clean.  This would be a great deep fryer if the controls were not so annoying and complicated.  You can't just 'set it and forget it', you have to follow a sequence of steps just to get the fryer to the desired temperature.  Then you have to select a time period for the frying or the fryer will cut off.  I find it all very annoying and unnecessary.  All of that aside, the fryer does a good job and is probably the best buy available for the quality of fried foods. "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great except for...,"I recently purchased this iron after reading the rave reviews.  This iron is great and does everything it says.  I just had one issue... even though it says that it has auto-shut off, for some reason even when I shut it off manually the light on the unit remains on and the iron is still hot...it is just me or did anyone else experience this problem. I hope I dont have a defective one"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,Great Product,This cookie sheet is wonderful.  I have used it and other airbake products for years.  All these people complaining that cookies stick do not know how to read product labels.  The cookie sheet says nothing about being non-stick.  You need to use a non-stick cooking spray.  Not everything out there is a non-stick product--READ ABOUT THE PRODUCTS YOU BUY BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM.  This is a perfectly good product. 
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Terrific product for the dollar,"This cordless hand vacuum is so handy and so easy to empty.  No need for replacing bags as with my regular vacuum.  The cordless is a must!  I wouldn't have known to get the more powerful hand vac except that my daughter had purchased this one and really liked it.  In looking at what is available, there are a number of models with less volts, but I think it's well worth it to spend a little more and get the 15.6 volt Dustbuster.  I paid $49.00  with free shipping after looking around at various sites.  My daughter indicated she remembered getting hers for $39.00, but I'm sure she probably paid for shipping.  I didn't see any new ones lower than the $49.00.  In any case, I'd highly recommend this product"

kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,I LOVE THIS COOKWARE!,"I did a lot of research before deciding to invest in these pans (they aren't cheap pans).  I loved the idea of being able to use metal utensils while still having some of the non-stick properties.

It's a cheap wood brush that swells up and cracks.  Plus it is designed so poorly, the head keeps falling off of the handle.  Yes, definetly buy a brush for your cast iron, it will do the best job.  But buy a generic one at the supermarket or Walmart for a lot less money, plus it won't fall apart"

Stores in a protective hard plastic case to prevent damage in the drawer.  Much more versatile than originally planned; use it for lemongrass, ginger and cheese for a VERY fine grate.

I will never be without this wonderful little helper"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Surprised and VERY pleased,"I had a hard time convincing myself that measuring cups and spoons could be worth this price, but the shapes were so innovative and -- well, logical -- that I succumbed.  The measuring cups are not measuring cups; they're cooking utensils of the finest quality.  Imagine tiny but heavy stainless steel saucepans, and you've got it.  In addition, neither the cups nor the spoons are ""tip-able"".  Genuis design and impeccable craftsmanship are the words to use for these welcome additions to my kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,5.0,"Well made, good looking and incredible value","I recently purchased this set for a friend. I already owned a set and when I bought it the cost was about three-times as much.

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,2.0,there are much better silicone bakeware products,"We have used silicone baking sheets before, which act as non-stick flexible surface that is easy to clean.  We'd been noticing silicone bakeware more and more, and were interested in the idea of having the silicone non-stick, easy-clean surface combined with the baking pan. So we finally decided to purchase the kitchen-aid mini-muffin pan when I was interested in having a nice non-stick mold for making marshmallows."

It is heavy for a stainless pan and cleans up beautifully.  When sauteing or frying it creates a beautiful fond for great gravies and sauces.  After looking in the stores and on the web and comparing quality and prices, my husband and I were extremely pleased with this selection.  It was, in fact, much higher in quality than what we had expected."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,4.0,only downside is a hot handle,"this kettle is great - stylish, heats quickly, holds plenty of water.  Only downside is that the handle still gets quite hot on our commercial range.  That's a little surprising, given the amount of research Oxo does to make products usable for people. the handle is the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 star"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Terrible,"I bought this based on the other reviews, but mine stopped working within six months of purchasing it.  It needed constant cleaning of the part that wasn't removable, in addition to sharpening ... and no, I wasn't using it to cut steel or pouring syrup all over it - just opening cans.  We ended up buying a replacement at a drug store for $8 that has worked exponentially better than this thing.  I am quite comfortable saying that it is by far the worst appliance I have ever owned.  Save your money"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,The worst POS coffeemaker ever ... doesn't deserve even 1 star,"My old coffeemaker finally gave up the ghost over Christmas.  I felt guilty spending a lot of money on myself to get another machine so I went with Target's cheapest ... this Toastmaster.  It is a choice I have resented and regretted ever since.  I will *never* buy a Toastmaster product again.  You can't pour water or coffee without it spilling all over the counter.  The machine is poorly built in that you can barely get the coffeepot out without forcing open the flimsy coffee door.  There's no auto-off option.  The ""stop and pour a cup"" concept doesn't work -- you run serious risk of burning yourself (or the house down) using this machine on a day-to-day basis and mine is going in the trash.  I went to Walmart last night and bought a decent Mr. Coffee machine with all the bells and whistles for $50 and it is already worth the price because of the lack of aggravation and disgust I didn't have to suffer thru this morning, just to get a cup o' joe going.  Save yourself the misery and spend the extra money on a different brand.  In this case, you *do* get what you pay for ... don't pay for this, whatever you do"

I was under the impression from the way they were advertised that you got a bath towel, hand towel, and wash cloth.  I paid 19.99 for the bath towel alone and bought two.  I was disappointed when I got them, but I was travelling so I had to move on and didn't go through the hassle of sending them back."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Hot pizzelles,"I bought this to make pizzelles for a travel program I was doing on Italy. The pizzelles came out nicely and were good. I used one of the recipes that came with the baker. Be sure to use the small measuring spoon that comes with it--it does give you the right amount for each pizzelle--even so, some of mine were ragged--but that just confirmed that they were homemade. Cooks fast and evenly. You are warned in the accompanying literature to be careful that the top of the baker will get hot--it does!  Guess how I know that?  I would buy this maker again--I'm pleased with it"

The problem is that they don't always turn off long enough to slow the cooking. "

I have also used it on veggies, it is great on any food and it is so easy to use.  It even used it on lettuce.  It comes with bags and rolls, initially I used the bags but now I personally prefer the rolls and the rolls are actually less expensive than the bags.  With the ""store and cut"" you can easily cut the roll to make just the right size bags for whatever you are vacuum packing.  I never thought I would use it as much as I do.  It is so easy to use, all you do is plug it in, seal one end, fill it and vacuum pack.  Also, the cord tucks in underneath which makes it easier to store.  This is great for any size family, I use it all the time for just 2 people.  I wish I got it sooner.  Very highly recommended! A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,SHOULD BE 6 STARS!  LOOK NO FURTHER.....,"Please do not confuse this model with other Oster blenders sold here and elsewhere! They might look the same, but are not!  This is THE model we all have seen in Bar's all over the world, for many years.  And for good reason.  THEY LAST! And it doesn't cost $100 +."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,exceptional baking pan,"Purchased this pan recently and am so pleased with the how well it bakes - I am looking to add to my baking set with more Nordic Ware.  I baked two loaves of &quot;Friendship Bread&quot; in this pan and my traditional loaf pan.  The one in this pan absolutely fell out beautifully!!  It did not stick at all and the shape made it extra nice.  The other one - well, it was a good thing it tasted good.  Definately recommend this pan"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,the best knife set!,"As my cooking skills increased beyond the capability of an old set of Farberware knives (which could not be sharpened), I found myself in search of a new set.  I didn't want to spend a king's ransom, but was really looking for quality. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Totally satisfied,These pans are super easy to clean!  They don't need to go in the dishwasher because all you need to do is wipe them with a paper towel then use a little soapy water and you're done.  EASY!  I haven't had them for very long so I'm curious to see how they'll hold up
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,don't bother,"I have owned this POS for around a year - well made but it has always had a burning motor smell - Cuisinart said it just ""needed to break in"".  I think the break-in period has come and gone and it still smells every time I use it.  As a blender it is fine, but the processor just simply doesn't work.  Just tried to grate some cheese and it once again failed me.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,A REAL pan!,"How wonderful to finally be able to cook with a real pan! I've been making do with some very old cheapy nonstick pans (picture loose, wobbly plastic handles, scratched nonstick interior, etc.) for quite a while. When the big pan from that set died recently, I just had to do without! Now I've finally got a real pan to replace it - this 5 1/2 quart saute pan! Just made my first dish with it - seared a roast to go into the oven, then sauteed some onions and garlic, and deglazed with the sauce. Awesome!  It was a great pleasure to work with, cooked evenly (I followed the instructions and turned the temp down a little, and sure enough it still heated up extremely well and cooked wonderfully), and cleaned up beautifully afterward.  The pan is large, but was not as heavy as I had expected one that size to be, although still a little challenging to handle one-handed.  Handle of pan and lid stayed nice and cool, I'm very impressed with this pan and will definitely be looking forward to building the rest of my Cuisinart Chef set! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Doodie Pans,"What's there to say, these doodie pans fit in the electric self scooping cat boxes that I bought.  They're too expensive, but that's what I get for wanting house cats with no doodie smell.  Sure I could emply the cat boxes five times a day by hand, but someone's got to work to buy all of the cat food right"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 12,4.0,Oven liners,"I think these liners are probably excellent if you have an oven with an element...however, I have a hidden element so they can't be placed directly on the oven floor.  So I will probably give them limited use since they seemed to restrict the airflow in convection mode (I have double JennAir convection ovens). "
kitchen & housewares,17 of 18,4.0,Versatile,"After a lot of looking around in the various department stores and net I could not find anything as versatile. The price was also impressive as compared to what's out there. Steamed vegetables came out great. Excellent for sausages and fried eggs. I still have a lot of experimenting to do but so far I am happy with my purchase. One negative comment, not as easy as a frying pan to clean. I hear that this is the case with all these types of electric cookers so it does not reflect a deficiency on this product alone"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,great gift,"I recieved this griddle for christmas last year and i use it at least once a week. I love the dual cook top. I use it for steaks and pork chops or the flat surface for pancakes or french toast.  I find it easy to clean, it comes with a little plastic scraper to clean the grill side.  It doesn't fit in the dishwasher but it takes me no time to clean.  I have a george foreman grill and another indoor grill but this is the only one i use"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Cool gadget,I can't believe how amazing this gadget is. I am so impressed it does exactly what is says and you have no wasted pineapple and an easy clean up
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,works well,Product worked as stated and did give off a funny odor when first used but does work well
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Finally a turner that is easy to clean!,"This is just what I was looking for!  I always wondered why somebody did not make turners that were non-stick like the frying pans that they are trying not to scratch.  Not only is the turner easy to clean, doesn't scratch the pan, but makes turning cheesy omelets really easy.  I am totally satisfied with this purchase"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,great product,"Have had this toaster oven for just over 10 days and so far, i love its looks. It bakes/heats evenly and the buttons/keys are all pretty intuitive."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great product,I have this scale and can testify that it is wonderful.  It works just as described giving you all the nutritional information you need for hundreds of food items. It's aesthetic and ergonomic features are a real plus
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Poor quality,"Four of the ""teeth"" on the first one I received broke off after the first use. The replacement sent by Amazon ""lost"" two ""teeth"" after the first use. Amazon--Great, Mario Batali--Bad"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,French pressure,"we purchased this product because both my wife and i developed quite a knack for breaking the glass presses. this metal press is working very well, we're very happy with it. it even keeps the coffee warm for quite some time without making it bitter. it's even managed to survive our clumsy ways"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"I love it, too.","I almost didn't buy this slicer because of all the negative reviews.  But I got it, pulled it out of the box, READ THE SHORT & SIMPLE DIRECTIONS, and was making gorgeous zuccini pasta in five minutes.  I think it's well made, sturdy, easy to use, and quick.  I had two huge plates of zuccini pasta within fifteen minutes (includes time to make the sauce). It's my new favorite toy. I don't know what's up with all the other bad reviews. Worked fine, immediately, for me"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,An overall great toaster for a family,"When we started looking for a new toaster after the death of our last, we realized we needed to upgrade to a 4 slot with our growing family. We live in a small apartment however and lots of counter space was out of the question. So first we got a Dualit, after reading all the reviews. Well, it needs to be prewarmed for best results and it gets incredibly hot to the touch, not too great for little fingers. So back it went and more reviews to read. We ended up getting the Cuisinart Cool Touch and although we worried about the reviews that mentioned an uneven warming problem, it hasn't happened for us. The toaster toasts quickly and well and yes, evenly on both sides--so far both toast and bagels have been great. It's easy to use and clean, has a great ""lift the toast higher"" feature and doesn't get hot on the outside. Oh and yes, it doesn't take up much room on the counter. So far, the best toaster we've ever had"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,there's nothing wrong w/ the measuring cup,"Some reviewers have complained the measuring cup is smaller than a ""real"" cup.... this is because that's what Asian people who eat rice everyday use to cook rice!!!  It's different from the measurements you use when you bake"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Great Vaccum,I just cant understand why people are so dumb.  It is very user friendly and well designed and it works just as expected.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love this knife!,This is a perfectly balanced wonderful chef's knife.  I highly recommend
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Perfect towel,"Normally I won't pay this much for a towel (after all, most any towel will get you dry), but since I needed to round out an order to get a discount, I did order two of these towels in white.Am I glad I did. Everyone deserves a little pampering sometimes! Beautiful white color, soft,and heavy enough to feel luxurious but not too heavy. Really just right.  "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,Be careful!,"I bought this attachment based on customer reviews which described a lid on the unit which holds the citrus in place. Well, KitchenAid must have &quot;improved&quot; it, because the unit came without any such lid. Consequently, you hold down the citrus with your fingers and can suffer pain and injury because of the speed of the processor spinning the reamer. Definitely not recommended"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Life with roomba,I've got a roomba scheduler.  Very handy to be able to tell it what time to automatically vaccuum.  I have one unit that vaccums the bedroom at 1pm and another that does the livingroom at 7am.  
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,egg timer,This is a neat gadet for boiling eggs and you can make them soft or hard boiled with this egg you add when boiling eggs
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works Fine,"I made the pefect lumpy potatoes with this.  Sounds odd, but that's what I wanted.  I have a ricer, but I wanted the mashed potatoes from my childhood.  I went out and bought this specifically for the task.  I have no regrets or complaints.  The handle felt fine, better than what my mother used to have.  I remember hers having more mashing surface, but that may be because I was young.  This one seems compact, so it works fine for a small amount of potatoes in a smaller bowl (perfect for me.)"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 7,1.0,Cuisinart from Macy's,"Ordered from Amazon, shipped from Macy's. Ordered Stainless pan, received wrong one with a non'stick surface which I did not want. Macy's return policy required me to pay for return shipping, unlike Amazon who lets you print out pre-paid return labels. Major hassle dealing with Macy's. Very unsatisfied"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,2.0,Fine Print,"My fault, but I didn't realize how TINY these cookie cutters really are... the listing does say that they are 1""-2"".  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great set and excellent value,I think these compare pretty well to my parents pricier Henckels and so represent a great value. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Amazing coffee brewed with little effort. ,The Bodum 8 cup French press is an amazing device which brews some great coffee in a very short time. I'm completely astounded by how great the coffee tasted and how quick it was. The press is smaller than I thought it would be but still brews a solid 2 mugs of coffee. It's a little finicky to clean but isn't a pain. I love it
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,4.0,buyer beware,I just recieved my Roomba via UPS.  I had owned a Roomba red before the Battery went dead so I am familer with the Roomba models.  I saw the 4210 for a good price and figured it was worth it.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,circulon cookware,this is by far the best non-stick cookware i have ever used. it heats evenly and the hard adonized surface releases food effortlessly. i would definately reccomend this product to anyone interested in it
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Utterly Perfect,"As a longtime collector of Homer Laughlin's Fiesta, I can say this pitcher might be the apex of design. It is form AND function, beautiful and sturdy. The colors never fade, and  you never have to worry about a chip. The range of colors is outstanding. I have one of these in every color except black "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Heavy Metal Beauty!,"I absolutly love using this clever. It looks killer &amp; works/feels even better. I really like the handles on the five star series. This clever is balanced perfect for me, it's somewhat blade heavy compared to the pro-s series which works out well for my chopping style. I like to use a comb. of wrist &amp; forearm movement &amp; let the weight of the blade do the work. This clever holds an edge very well &amp; trues back up nice w/a henckels 12&quot; diamond steel. This is the perfect clever for me &amp; I'd definately replace if lost/stolen"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Has the chemical smell,"The inner pot is not all that thick. The sanyo 5-cup (not the 5.5-cup) has truely thick pot. This one is just average, among the computerized rice cookers."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,Best Cup of Coffee I Have Ever Had (minus a tad bit of clean up),"As my title suggests, this coffee grinder gives you the best cup of coffee you could ever possibly make.  I won't go into the benefits of a burr coffee grinder, but I will address peoples complaints and   provide some tips."

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,The 3 1/2 Quart Saucepan That Saved Dinner,This thing heats up incredibly fast.  I put two cups of rice and 3 cups of cold water into it and it boiled in like two minutes.  That's just unbelievable really.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Nice thin slices.,"This zester gives nice, thin slices of orange peel. I had to learn to use short strokes with the zester, otherwise the peel comes off in very long strings and must be chopped before use. The stainless steel is easy to clean"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,1.0,did not get,i ordered this item 5 months ago was told by amazon that i would get this item and it was avaliable and then after 5 months they tell me that they cant get it and it is still avaliable on there web site as far as im concerned amazon is not worth shopping if they cant hold there promises and say it is avaliable please take this very seriously when ordering from amazon thank
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,"Nice quality, nice price","I got this cookware set, and I have to say I am not disappointed in the least.  The finish on the silver is shinier than its looking in the photos here, but not mirror finished by any means.  All the pots and pans, even the stockpot, are ultra light and heat throughly and evenly.  The handles are sturdy, and come with a thumb grip made of soft, but firm rubber.  The lids made of glass, have metal grips bolted into them and are sturdy.  The grips are also covered in a rubber to reduce slip, and are oversized so that oven mits can fit through them."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,1.0,Throw this item in the trash,"I brought this coffee maker about a month ago.  It*s the old story, you get what you pay for.  This coffee maker is the worst piece of garbage, I*ve ever purchased.  You can*t pour water from the pitcher into the coffeemaker without it leaking all over the place."
kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,4.0,Nice Scale for Multiple Uses,"This sturdy little kitchen scale has served us well. It has reasonably high accuracy for the price, can weigh up to 11lbs+, and has a very small footprint. The batteries (two watch batteries included) last years on end without replacement. The glass surface is very tough and cleans easily. The large, flat surface allows for using tares (containers, which the scale can be reset to zero when loaded with) in measuring, also further extending the scales usefulness."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Not gonna stick,"These omelette pans are so great.  The conduct heat really well.  Cleaning is a breaze.  Sometimes you can just use your kitchen sink sprayer and remove all the food...it just slips off!  I totally recommend any of the Calphalon Commercial Nonstick pans.  I bought my mother a huge set and she loves them.  I don't know about the quality of older ""classic"" Calphalon pans but these are really good...at least the Commercial series.  Buy them, you won't regret it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,"For what it is, it will serve its purpose","This cover, like all Kitchenaid products, is very well made. The material is very heavy and durable. It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but it does keep the dust and junk out of my mixer. I have the smallest mixer and this cover fits pretty good. It might fit the next size up as well, but not any larger I wouldn't think"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Very Good Deal!,"We just received our new Analon Titanium Cookware set, and all I can say is WOW! They are very heavy duty, have a lifetime warranty on the nonstick, and look to built for a serious chef's kitchen."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"Good item, but note that it's plastic","I'm generally pleased with this item for the price, but I wish the description would have said whether it's plastic or ceramic.  I personally like ceramic, but I guess maybe I should have known because of the price.."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Value - Tough Daily Dishware,"Durable, inexpensive, great looks."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,works easily at all stages,"A very easy to use corkscrew.  Handles corks and those plastic corks easily. The rabbit corkscrew is nice too, but this beats the rabbit in ease of insertion, extraction, and then extraction of the cork off the corkscrew, by at least two to one.  This is very important as my wife can't use a rabbit anymore, it requires too much arm strength.  This one is a snap.  It's also much easier than the simpler two handed corkscrew that looks like a, how do I describe it, like a jumping jack exercise when both handles go up at the same time, you know what I mean I hope, when you crank in the screw and the dual handles go up, then you pull down on the handles to remove the cork.  Instead of the jumping jack one, use this one, it's a lot easier at ALL stages--insertion, extraction, cork removal from the tool.  Plus I've never yet jammed a cork into the bottle, which these other tools occasionally do--oh, one can survive from that, the point is that this corkscrew does it right, and easily, from all aspects.  It's built sturdily too, so it will likely last longer (better built, and also gets less stress from the user as all aspects of its operation are easier) than the others.  To explain, if you use a tool and have to yank on it a lot, you know that the stress you put on it in use is not going to have it last as long as a tool that works with just a little bit of effort.  This corkscrew is really good.  It almost makes you want to use it too much. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,NO NONSTICK FOR WOK COOKING!,"You should NOT use nonstick coatings for wok cooking.  Wok cooking is extremely high temperature. Nonstick coatings tend to burn away and to ""off gas"" at wok temperatures. Use hard anodized, plain or stainless steel for wok cooking. Use an oil with a high smoke point. For everyday cooking I use canola or olive oils. I personaly use a blend of oils for Chinese cooking. I use Corn oil (or canola) as the base with a small amount of peanut oil (very high smoke point but has a distinctive flavor which is good for chinese thai etc) and a touch of sesame oil"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,My cats love it!,"I bought this because my cats are both male and I've heard they can develop urinary problems if they don't drink enough water.  Well, they're definitely drinking more now that I have the Drinkwell!   They love it!   The waterfall fascinates them and one of my kitties keeps sticking his paw under it.  The only reason I'm giving them four stars instead of five is the placement of the dial that controls the water flow.  It's in the ""dish"" part of the bowl . . . Well, one of my enterprising kitty boys has discovered it and keeps moving the dial to the highest setting.  It seems to me they could have made it a little less cat accessible"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 16,5.0,Cuisinart is short-sighted,"I love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor.  Since I use it for all sorts of cooking, I have purchased all of the disks for it.  I don't want three or four different holders for disks, etc. because I don't have unlimited closet and counter space.  Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don't they sell a tower (small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.  I have friends who have the same gripe.  If someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,It works,I got it and it not only looks great it works. That's what we are all looking for any way in a great coffee maker
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,What's The Problem?,"I was really dispirited to read so many unhappy reviews about this product.  Our groomer recommended and lent us this so we could try it out on our sheltie,(the barker) and our collie, (the follow-up barker) before investing in yet another ""bark deterrant"".  We have used it for 3 days both indoors and out using the audible feature to determine the correct sensitivity setting and finding the correct location before switching to ultrasound,while also using the reinforcing ""Quiet"". After observing how effective this product has been in the 3 days, we are ready to purchase.  I am sure that it probably won't work as effectively on 'garbage or gardening days' or in households that are very active, but it has prevented both dogs from getting into that ""wound up"" frame of mind on regular days giving me better peace of mind and the ability to make phone calls without that nuisance barking for no apparent reason.  Considering the $50 cost in comparison to some products in the $100 range which quit and had to be re-purchased immediately to not break training continuity - check with a trainer, boarder or groomer and test it out first.  We are very happy with this and are considering two for different locations in the house"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,LOVELY,"This set is just as it is described.  The embroidery has a lovely heart shaped design draping off the king pillowcases and top sheet.  I was happy to see that the ""frost"" color was an off white and could easily been called, ""vanilla"" or ""cream"" or ""ivory"" which is exactly what I needed to blend with the bedding.  It is well worth the very low price and looks perfect on the guest bed"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Looks great, good quality however","My mother bought my family the coffee table and two end tables from this set.  They look great!  The quality is great and the price is reasonable.  However, the sea grass baskets were not meant to hold items of that much weight.  We put videos, dvds, and in one, some photo albums.  After a couple times of being pulled in and out the black paint has been scratched off the furniture.  We'll cover our mistake with permanent maker.  Just wanted to let others know to keep the basket load light.  Thanks"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,2.0,Not worth it,This thing is made of very poor quality glass and plastic and is a messy way to cold brew coffee. You can get the same results putting coarsely ground coffee and water in a jar and straining it through cheese cloth. It's a waste of money
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great Set of Dishes,"If you have a large dishwasher these are wonderful dishes, they are not only beautiful, but sturdy, and I was so impressed to see that they had a one year break and chip warrenty with them. Anyway they are wonderful and we love them."

kitchen & housewares,14 of 16,5.0,Cuisinart or KitchenAid?,"I am the unfortunate owner of a Kitchenaid 11 cup processor (I rated the Cuisinart 5 stars, but I really do not know).  Seeing all the negative comments below about the Cuisinart, I sadly have to respond that all the flaws of the Cuisinart apply equally to the KitchenAid.  Despite using the KitchenAid sparingly and with care, I have broken 2 bowls (at $40 + $9 S&H each) and one lid at $20 + S&H.  Although the KitchenAid motor is well made, the plastic bowls are flimsy and poorly designed.  In addition the bowl leaks down the side if liquid is blended.  The lid is exceedingly hard to clean.  Consequently, I am thinking of replacing my KitchenAid with the Cuisinart"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,4.0,Purchase a set from Cooking.com,The irons themselves - rock!  They aren't as heavy duty as are old set - but they are still Cast Iron (ya know the kind - a magnet sticks to them).  Sure beat the heck out of a Aluminum set - any day of the week!  I can cook almost 4 cookies (w/cast iron) two one (w/aluminum).  Cookies seem to be much crispier and thinner by comparison too. 
kitchen & housewares,5 of 9,4.0,I got Vietnam :),"The box reads that silverware is Made in Indonesia/Vietnam/or China.""  The wooden tray is made in China.  Having read the negative reviews about some sets made in Indonesia, I understood that affordable flatware couldn't be expected to be made in the USA or Germany.  I checked the Oneida website and found that the Stafford pattern had the best warranty.  This pattern is acceptable and feels okay in my hand.  It is packed in individual plastic socks and the handout suggests removal from plastic otherwise they will rust.  I had a cabinet full of 1950s restaurant stainless steel flatware made in Japan and they rusted unused.  The Oneida website sells pieces individually.  I mainly needed to replace all my spoons and the same cost after discount from Amazon, $114.99, would have given me 22 spoons with free shipping from Oneida; so at the expense of 10 place spoons, I got 12 each of teaspoons, dinner forks, salad forks, dinner knives and some serving utensils.  The pieces look more normal in reality than in photographs."

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Lodge Logic Pro Cast-Iron Griddle,"The griddle works great but it's very heavy.  And not so easy to clean--which you must do well.  Especially if you want to grill fruit and vegetables as well as meat.  All things considered, I'm glad i bought it"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Why'd I wait?,"I wish I'd picked one of these up years ago.  The even cooking, easy cleaning, and the essential beauty of this pot make it the best choice for family cooking.  Or, if like me, you feed friends and neighbors too, this is a wonderful pot"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Amazing Product,"This is a great product that really works and is surprisingly well made.  One thing I will say is that the toast adjustment is a little on the lighter side so if you like your toast really dark, you may have to run it through twice.  Making each feature operate independently or together was a smart move too.  Great item! "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great but not for Kids or the Clumsy,"These glasses are great but not for kids or the clumsy.  As billed they keep the beverage inside at the apropriate temperature without either freezing or burning your hands.  They are light and atractive and very comfortable to hold. However, they are delicate so care must be taken when washing.  All in all they provide a handsome and helpful addition to one's glassware"

By the way, I use my Kitchenaid stand mixer every day and my only other accessory is the juicer. Michele at geo@yhti.ne"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 14,2.0,"Wonderful, until the handle cracked","I purchased this wok for my husband's Christmas present.  It was lovely, we cooked two meals in it Christmas day.  Nice heat transfer, beautiful on the table (but big).  That night, he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan.  It's considerably narrower than the normal Le Creuset handle.  Back it went to Williams Sonoma, where there were a few other L.C. woks with similar cracks!  Phooey to you, Le Creuset."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,The best ice cream scoop,"especially for those of us who make ice cream filled cakes!  For this purpose, the goal is not to have a ball of ice cream, but a flatter sheet.  This spade just whizzes through even rock hard ice cream without extra effort, and never freezes up so that ice cream starts sticking to it.  Excellent tool.  .."

kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,2.0,Not loud enough,"I'm not sure the timer I receib=ved works properly. The timing mechanism dseems accurate, however, the sound it makes when the time is up is more like a ""ticking"". If you are nor right near it, you'll never hear it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,4.0,could be better,"This is my first quality chef knife. Although most items cut very easily, harder items such as carrots dont cut as easily as I had hoped. I am using the Henkels honer but maybe it needs to be sharpened with a sharpener. Even so, I am very pleased with the results I am getting"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Great can opener, but not so Break-resistant white plastic","This is a great can opener, but after using it for 5+ years the plasic has begun to crack in places and a piece of the plastic has chipped off on the side by the metal. It says here in the product features that it has Break-resistant white plastic. I hardly think so. Also since it is white plastic it tends to discolor and yellow easily. Don't leave it too close to something hot...I learned this the hard way...the handle melted a bit. If I were in the market for a replacement (which I might be very soon if it cracks any more) I would probably buy the Kuhn Rikon Safety Lid Lifter DELUXE Can Opener because it doesn't have white plastic, it has stainless steel and a black turning knob"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,4.0,Wish they had one a little larger,"This is a great product.  The lids fit tightly and it is microwavable.  I was able to throw away all the margarine tubs, etc.   Too bad there wasn't at least a couple of larger containers"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,One hot burner,I have tried several single burners for my canner.  This is the only one hot enough to produce a consistent boil
kitchen & housewares,0 of 11,4.0,pretty good knife,"best knife for the price....others are better, but cost alot mor"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great alternative to non-stick,"I was looking for a pan to cook eggs (omlets) in, but didn't want to get non-stick, or teflon or whatever.  This pan was recommended by the nytimes.  It's not as perfect as an old seasoned cast iron skillet, but the le creuset pan is big, heavy and practically non stick, especially if you use a bit of oil.  I cook everything in it -- chicken, hamburgers, fried eggs and omlets, sausage, pancakes -- and it's easy to clean, almost as non stick as my teflon pans (which I chucked).  For what it is, it's pretty great"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,How a $7.95 Pitcher from Amazon Cost You $15.94,"If you put a ""juicer"" in your cart, Amazon will suggest that you also buy this pitcher.  If you buy this Pitcher with other items eligible for free shipping, pay close attention.  Amazon will sneak in a $7.99 shipping charge that is not eliminated from your final costs."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great for the Price,"I purchased my set to replace a mixed mess of plastic handled serrated blades and some old Chicago's that I had mooched from my parents 20 years ago. Of the two types, I much prefer the straight blade, and to sharpen them myself. Despite what another review suggests, this is very easy to learn to do even for ""people like us"". My old Chicago's are still in good condition ever after repeated trips through the dishwasher (this set will stay out however), even the walnut is only slightly faded. Consider buying a sharpening stone which allows you to put a finer edge on them than the steel, and sharpen less often"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,One of my best purchases ever...,This pitcher is beautiful and works great.  I use it for iced tea
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Adapts to the shape of saucepans and bowls...,"Not only is this my favorite whisk, it is truly well made. While making a custard filling for caramel �clairs (you know those magical �clairs in the Simply Irresistible movie) I found that the balloon shape and the way the wires adapt themselves to the shape of a saucepan was highly desirable."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,2.0,Disappointed with quality.,"Although I was pleased with the look of this set, the blades of the knives did not hold up.  Upon washing, black spots appeared that did not come off and appeared to be some sort of tarnish.  I was very disappointed and returned the set.  Brand new flatware should not look like that after a week of use"
kitchen & housewares,17 of 19,4.0,"Durable, easy to clean and use","I've gone through a lot of hand powered food choppers,"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Useful,"I use it for reducing sauces, but also like it for soups, reheating chile, or caramelizing some onions.  I'm not a purist.  If it works, it works, and this pan works for multiple purposes.  It IS a little ""handle heavy"" but that's a minor quibble in my view. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great item,"Boy, do I LOVE this piece! I got mine for a LOT less at an outlet store and it's just wonderful. I LOVE the purple color - it's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table. It does wonderfully in the oven - it's not overly big so don't get it to feed a family of 5 or so.  It's about 1.5 quarts.  I get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple, well, it's just original and if you're afraid of it, don't be. It's just a gorgeous color and one that I'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen. I'm getting more! Highly recommended piece."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,This is my second one!,"This little canister vacuum is excellent for several reasons. It is compact and has great tools.  It picks up dirt, etc. great.  We have 2 vacation rental cabins and I have purchased them for ease in storage and for the multi-purpose tools for when I clean upholstery, window crevices, hard to reach areas.  Light and easy to maneuver.  Also love the easy to dump dirt area...no bags to deal with except an occassional hepa filter"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Stopped working after 5 months,"I had a DeLonghi toaster oven that worked like a charm for 12 years. With no hesitation, I purchased this one. Like the other posters, our toaster oven just stopped working for no apparent reason. What a hassle"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,I have no more tupperware chaos,"The other reviewers are right that the shipping time is lengthy -- I waited three months.  They are also right that the construction is not as substantial as Tupperware, but it is adequate.  Finally, by the time all of the shipping and handling fees are added, the set costs about $25."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 13,2.0,Tasteless Tea,"Tea does not taste very good with the Sunbeam Hot Tea Maker.  This tea maker also uses too many tea bags.  It requires two tea bags to make 12 to 16 ounces of tea.  I was amazed by how quickly this item did make tea.  The reason it makes tea so fast is because it simply pours hot water over your tea bags.  Why not boil water in the microwave and pour it over your tea bags?  You would get the same result.  This tea maker doesn't brew tea.  You really need to boil tea to get the flavor from the tea bags.  Another interesting feature of this item is that you literally have to take it apart to clean it.  There are five different components that you will have to clean after every use.  A teapot is much easier to use than this.  It takes a little longer to boil tea in a teapot, but a teapot produces better-tasting tea.  You should try to get a good teapot instead of this.  Modern whistling teapots are made of stainless steel and porcelain.  They brew tea in about 15 minutes."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Odd is good!,"I find the odd sizes are very useful - why use two spoons when one will do the job? Beautifully made, heavy steel"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great zester,Gives nice thin strips of peel.  Easy to use and clean.  Love it for lemon and orange peel
kitchen & housewares,3 of 8,1.0,Garbage,"I bought this about two years ago and immediatly started using it. For a short period of time it worked just fine... and then everything started to stick to it. I finally through this in the garbage due to a coffee cake being stuck in there and not coming out, and no amount of cleaning would restore the pan. I will admit that I'm not a great cook, but I followed all the precautions for a non-stick pan and never overcooked anything. So, for me, this was a big letdown"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very nice,This sham is really nice. It's very soft and comfortable for sleeping. I was surprised how nice it was.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Cheerful and elegant,"The design of this pattern is simple, cheerful and elegant. I enjoy the Corelle livingware collections for casual dinning. They are light-weight, very easy to clean, chip resistant, which is great for little kids. The dinner plate, bowl and saucer are made in USA, the mugs are made in Thailand. I have seen this set at the Corelle outlet store, the Amazon price is really a bargain even campared to the outlet price"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,This makes bad water taste good,"I know others say this product does nothing, but IMHO if you have crappy water like we do it really helps. We have really poor tasting water and this filter makes a huge difference. They recommend you use it for 1 month, but we only change it once every three months. Really worth it, you can see the crud collected on the filter too"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,AWESOME!,"This slicer works GREAT! - Do yourself a favor & pony-up the extra $ for this model (or any higher # model) as its made in Germany whilst the cheaper models are made in China. I have used this to slice several roasts & some flank steak for jerkey & it works as advertised, you can slice as thick or thin as you like. I strongly suggest you pay attention to all warnings & watch what youre doing as the blade is SUPER sharp! Treat the machine with respect as one careless move & youll regret it Im sure"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Very Dissapointed and Frustrated,"After having to take my daughter to the ER when she cut her finger trying to open a can with one of the three horrible can openers in the house, I went out and bought this one."
kitchen & housewares,19 of 20,5.0,All you should ever need steamer.,"Great item ! Norpro makes very versatile double steamer.It's easy to use and easy to clean.It's big enough to steam large items, Yet can be small enough for lesser amounts.It can be seperated to cook in seperate pots so flavors won't mingle and it saves cooking time.It foldes compactly to take less storage space than larger steamers. So if you already have pots this should be the only steamer you  ever need"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Espresso Maker,"I bought this Espresso maker because I am always driving thru or stopping at Starbucks and other coffee stores and was spending WAY TOO MUCH for it.  A friend has the Saeco Vienna Espresso Coffee maker and I saw him use it.  It was so easy and the espresso drink was so good and tasty.  I decided it was easy enough for me.  So I bought one and I love it.  All the regulars at the coffee shops I used to go to wonder why I haven't been there in a long time and I have to tell them I found something MUCH, MUCH BETTER.  I would recommend it to everybody who loves espressos, mochas, etc. It's not cheap, but it's worth the money."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,WearEver Commercial 24-Cup Mini-Muffin Pan,"This is a heavy-duty, commercial constructed bakeware! Muffins are well baked in this pan. Good heat conducting & easy release. However, the muffins are truly ""mini"". Each muffin cup measures 1-3/4 inches in top diameter, 1-1/4 inches in bottom diameter, and 3/4 inch deep, which is too small for me to use with the mini muffin paper lining cups I have. (I also have a Farberware 12-cup mini muffin pan, which fits the paper lining fine.) I just have to wash 24 cups every time after I use it, which bothers me a little! I've never put any nonstick bakeware/cookware in the dishwasher even though it's dishwasher safe. WearEver did carry lifetime warranty, but you have to pay for the shipping to send the item back to them before they send you the replacement one"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A must have item,"Fabulous tool.  Works great, no messing with nasty bristles-just rinse and place in dishwasher-comes out clean everytime.  For turkey basting, better to have one with a longer hander.  This brush is definitely worth every penny"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Good line of pans,"For almost two years I've had several sizes of these pans. They have good weight and balance, are very easy to clean quickly, and are reasonably priced. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 13,1.0,It ripped only after one week of use,I was so looking forward to helping my employees avoid burns on their arms as they pulled out the cookie backing racks from our oven. I have a gourmet cookie factory in Argentina and I had tried many different mitts for my employees. This one looked to be my salvation since at first it worked great by covering the arms as they wheeled out the cookie racks from the oven. The mitt ripped open at the base of the thumb rendering it useless. The rack does not have any sharp edges so now I am back to looking for other mitts
kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,2.0,Grinding it out...,Plusses: The percolator perks quickly and keeps the coffee quite hot - brews a good strong cup of tasty coffee. Very few parts to break. Nice light on the side to tell you when the coffee is ready.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Everything I thought it would be and more!,I really wanted to buy this but was having second thoughts after reading so many poor reviews. I love mine and it works just fine. It is so easy my 8 & 10 year old girls love to use it. It is a great!!!! product
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Kitchen Aid Food Grinder Attachment,"The product did not have the wooden part shown in the picture.  Instead, it had a different plastic piece to push the food into the grinder with.  I would rather have had the wooden piece shown in the picture"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Excellent quality value.,"This is a handy, sturdy and attractive ice cream scoop with a unique, pointed-edged shape that works its way through the hardest ice cream, frozen yogurt, sorbet or sherbet with minimal effort. Its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand, making it require less force to operate than the more traditional scoops do, and keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,5.0,Perfection,"Holds everything.  Makes perfect pot roasts.  I use all clad MC2 for most cooking, but when I need to braise I use this -- I love it"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Best ice cream 'scoop' ever,"Like other reviews say, this is the best ice cream scoop ever (well, ""spade"").  I've had mine for 2 years now.  No matter how cold or hard the icecream/yogurt is, the spade cuts right through.  I considered getting the type that has anti-freeze type liquid which supposedly helps.  I'm so glad that I got this Kitchen Aid spade - it works far better than any other scoop that I've tried.  The handle is perfect as well, and the whole thing is well-balanced."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Love It!,"This is my first cleaver ever and I love having it.  Works great, just the right size and heft"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Works Fine,After reviwing various coffee makers using various website I finally decided on the Black & decker DCM2500B.  I was looking for a coffee maker that would pour a cup of coffee without spilling or taking forever to pour.  Having had a Krupps 10 cup maker I was greatly upset with how often the coffee dripped off of the bottom as I was pouring a cup of coffee.  The Black & decker DCM2500B coffee maker does not spill a drop and makes coffee that taste just fine.  I highly recommend this machine if you are looking for spill proof pouring
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,cooking crazy,"This was an addition to a set my son gave me for Christmas and since I got it I had used it more than the rest of the set, which by the way I love. The bottom surface is steady and heats up evenly and food does not stick to bottom.  Farberware pot and pans are great in my opinion."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Get a grip...they're just corn holders,"To my knowledge, there are two sets of Oxo corn holders -- the regular ""Good Grips"" and the ""Steel"" lines.  The ones I ordered from this page and received from Amazon were the ""Good Grips"" and they are black and yellow, like a large bumblebee(28381), the photo here is old.  The ""Steel"" ones are black and stainless steel and cost almost twice as much(1050061).  They both are great... large and sturdy and I'm satisfied with my Bumble Bees for $6.00.  Good product just be aware there are 2 sets and Amazon's set up is a bit confusing. By the way, I store them in a used wine cork in the drawer as they are indeed sharp"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love it!,"I love this bowl!  It's got a simple, yet very elegant design that goes perfectly with the rest of the Summer Breeze collection.  Everything in the set is sturdy and does extremely well in the dishwasher.  The colors are vivid, and have stayed that way through several trips in the dishwasher.  I love the set (I was tickled to see it recently in ModernBride magazine!) and would recommend it to anyone"
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,arrived split,"This cutting board is very lightweight in person, possibly lighter than the plastic cutting board I have been using.  I regret ordering this as it arrived damaged (but still shrinkwrapped!) It looked like the cutting board separated along the gluing of pieces. Hmph!  Don't buy this.  I am going to try to return this without losing free shipping on the entire order but you should bear in mind the hassle of returning this very flimsy collection of toothpicks before you add it to your cart. "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Good Price,The only problem is one of the board started to seperate from the middle.  It's still together at the moment but it seems that the wood expanded. My wife still likes the cutting board
kitchen & housewares,9 of 17,1.0,ONLY Works for 1 year,It only works upto one year and then simply dies. Ours stopped working in just year since we bought it last year. As if its dead. Just want to let you know this. However during the first year it works great!.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 7,4.0,Happy with the purchase,This is a good slicer- I wouldn't want to go with anything inferior- the model below this one probably wouldn't work too well- This one slices fine and is moderately easy to clean. Not effortless but not too bad
kitchen & housewares,5 of 9,5.0,Cuisinart Mini Food Processor,"For small quantities, this gadget does a great job and is easy to use and clean"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 14,5.0,"yes it's cute, but it's functional too","Why not be whimsical with your barware?  Perfectly functional set, this bar set is fun too"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great dishes,"These are great durable dishes! They look beautiful, I'am getting many compliments from friends! I have had no problems with the microwave, we make oatmeal in the bowls and tea in the cups everyday!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,1.0,Returned the product !,This was supposed to be a new item.  It definately wasn't.  The Proctor label on the handle was worn and the blades were dirty.  I was very disappointed!  
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Totally Awesome Rolling Pin,I've had this rolling pin for 4 years now and just love it.  I am a avid pie maker and it is the best.  I am ordering another just because I dropped mine on my cement driveway during our move and chipped the ends.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,extremely versatile,I have the 8 inch cooks knife as well but find myself using the 6 inch more frequently.
kitchen & housewares,18 of 22,1.0,Look great but cut poorly,Nice looking set. I've never owned a set of knives that cut as poorly as these (at any price). The knives tear food and do not make a clean cut
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great for microwaving meal-sized soup or oatmeal,"When all you're having is a big bowl of chunky soup for lunch or oatmeal for breakfast, this bowl goes great in the microwave and on to the sofa with you."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,I'm and addict,"I love these, especially the rectangles and the ones on the spinning thing. I'm looking for the cereal boxes if any one has seen them. And they are definitely dishwasher safe"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,This thing really works,I was skeptical. I got it for Christmas and figured it was going back to Amazon. But I tried it and it actually works. I've been using it for about a month now and it's great
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Best tool ever made,"You have no idea how great this product is. Its A man's pizza cutter. Best pizza cutter of all time. I must warn all of you that the bolt/screw and nut are not stainless steel and has started to rust on mine. But what is so great about this tool is that I was able to replace the parts at the awesome Westlake and it works even better now. Replace the main bolt with a 3/4inch long that is 1/8 inch wide and has a phillups head. You have to make a sleve from an alluminum spacers. (Buy the 3/4inch long one and cut it in half, its perfect because it has a 3/8inch diameter with a 1/8inch hole. Put the old blade and the old black spacers in first, slide the alluminum spacer/retainer in the hole, then attach the bolt and adjust the nut to the tightness you want. Now I have the ultimate custom Type R pizza cutter. BUUAAAA Haa Haa Haa Haaaaa"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Terri,"Wow, just what every serious cook needs. It's beautiful, well designed and a PERFECT selection of untensils. Thanks for all of the acurate reviews from other lucky owners. For the amazing price, you just can't go wrong."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great blender!,"Very powerful blender in a small package!  I bought this for mixing my protien shakes while deployed, and is surpasses all my expectations and stands up to the abuse of a deployed lifestyle.  Only issue is that the housing covering the blade is a little bit too large to fit into a Nalgene bottle, but the mixing cup that's included does a fine job"
kitchen & housewares,33 of 33,5.0,"Great convection oven, but huge","I love this ""convection"" oven.  I ordered it thinking it would be slightly larger than my Delonghi toaster oven, which I was replacing.  I was wrong.  It is at least three to four times bigger than the size of an ordinary toaster oven.  Other than that, I love EVERYthing about this oven.  It is easy to use, gorgeous with its stainless steel finish, has the capacity to cook a turkey! if you wanted to, and has such a classic, streamlined look to it.  I have gotten numerous compliments on it from everyone.  It is of the best quality in the kitchen appliances, and I only buy the top of the line things.  This is a lot better than what you'd get from Crate & Barrel or Williams & Sonoma.  The food turns out very evenly heated.  You don't get burnt spots or the middle that's still cold like you would with a cheap oven.  Easy to clean (my last oven was a pain to clean), and performs better than I ever imagined.  If you can afford the cost and the counter space, I would definitely recommend that you get it. "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 13,5.0,Great Little Sushi Making Kit,"This kit is a great gift idea and a really good way to start making yer very own bonafide sushi -- both nigiri (rice ball) and maki (roll). All you need is an expert fish buyer, a knife that is sharp as h**l, and some itty bitty little bowls for soy sauce. Everything else is IN THE BOX. Sushi Chef brand soy sacue is the best soy sauce you ever had, IMHO."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,5.0,Wonderful knife!,"I recently received this knife, and several others of the same brand.  What a pleasure to use!! And a great value for the price. You can't go wrong with these knives"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Great Tasting, Great Looking, Great Price","This is definitely not your conventional coffee maker.  It is pretty to the eyes, but most of all, it tastes absolutely wonderful!  The coffee served from this maker could easily be passed as a Starbucks brew.  I was convinced to buy this when I saw  and tasted it at a neighbor's house.  She then said it was reasonably priced as well.  After checking online at all the sites available, Amazon's of course beat all other prices.  This truly is a great buy.  Besides the marvelous taste that all comment on, it is the perfect alternative for coffee drinkers who are not morning people.  Because it can be programmed to start brewing, shuts off after two hours, and you can get your coffee while it is still brewing, we morning rushers can still have our favorite coffee that gives that needed kick.  The only complaint is the lack of clarity in the cleaning directions that came with the coffee maker.  This was not impossible though and overcoming the confusing and inadequate technical writing is well worth it"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Enhances the wine drinking experience,"I was at first skeptical of how an expensive wine glass would enhance one's experience of enjoying a nice wine.  These glasses are perfectly balanced, they make lifting a filled glass effortless.  These Bordeaux glasses can be used for many different types of red wines, so don't feel locked in with using these for a Bordeaux only."
kitchen & housewares,21 of 27,4.0,This rack is smarter than some of the reviewers,"This pasta rack is simple, functional, efficient, foldable and--yes--cheap. In response to some of the other comments:"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Batteries Won't last,"I bought this just over a year ago and it worked great for the first few months.  Now it is worthless, the thing dies within seconds.  I am not exaggerating at all, if you started the vac at the same time you started reading this review it would have been dead by now. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"Perfect balance of size, cost and power","If you want to get a stand mixer, you should get a Kitchenaid.  That goes without saying, in my opinion.  But deciding which one to get is tough.  You need to balance size, cost and power.  The 5-quart Pro is a very good balance of the three.  $299 is a great price (and it can go below that too).  I highly recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Works great and nothing to break!,"I got tired of short-lived coffeemakers, and believe me we have quite a collection in the garage, so I decided to buy something foolproof.  It takes a little trial and error to figure it out; if you don't turn it down when it starts to perk it boils over and if you let it perk too long the coffee burns - 8 minutes works for me.  It does what it's supposed to do every single time, without fail, and the coffee is piping hot (be careful), unlike the machines.  All for a really great price"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Another Believer,"After reading all of the reviews I finally decided to take the plunge. I was very hesitant and so was my husband he figured I was buying another gadget that didnt do any of the things that it claimed (my last one being the scunci steamer uggg D- at the best... anyways that's another review) After a week I am thrilled with the reconditioned bot also so is hubby seems very impressed although its hard to get him to admit it he thinks a little on the creepy side. It does a great job on the hardwoods floors they look and feel great. I had a little trouble with the battery charging at first but went to the website for troubleshooting and cleared it all up. I will say the only con so far has been that yes, it is a little bit noisy but I set it when we are leaving and voila come home to a shiny dust free floor. I was worried that it would not be able to cross the doorway threshhold as mine are a little high but I need not have worried the little gripper tires make it over just fine. I was also worried that it would have trouble getting underneath my dining room table and chair, however here is where it excels in cleaning it goes in and out and around each and every chair its amazing to watch so yes there is also the added value of entertainment lol. I would definately recommend it A+. I only rated it a 4 due to the noise a 5 definately it they could quiet it a bit"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This is an amazing product,"Bought this a few years ago for my partner who had fibro myalgia, and have used it daily ever since.  A friend just fell and broke her arm @ the wrist, so I loaned it to her. She fell so in love with it that she found it here on the net and is purchasing one for herself"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Good value,"Arrived nicely packaged.  Works well for a nice family pasta dinner, would recommend something a little more fancy for company"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great product - too small!,I have never had an insulated beverage mug keep things HOT as long as this one. It does a FANTASTIC job of insulating! It just wasn't large enough for me. They need to make one just like it that holds 2 cups of tea instead of one
kitchen & housewares,2 of 8,5.0,not wanting this for herbs...,I am anxiously awaiting this product..but not for herbs.. I have a similar one.....and its a NOODLE CUTTER ... sure they call it an herb mincer....but  for noodles...you can't get a better cutter....this one is for my mom in law....who makes noodles and dries them to sell ..all we have been able to find are cheap white plastic handled  'mincers'  i have a german made steel one....but to get one like mine...and shipped here would cost me over 50$ so i'm hoping this will be the answer to our  noodle cutter problems..... will let you know when it arrives...  abbey ... Update..... this is fantastic...will get  more for christmas presents ...
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,Great for fridge and vents for microwave; bad for arthritics,"I love these storage containers. They clean easily by hand or dishwasher, and the little pop-open microwave vent is fantastic. You hardly have to open them to go from Fridge to microwave. As other people have said, they're cleaner than plastic."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,You Get What You Pay For,"As I always do, I did lots of research on electric can openers before buying the West Bend.  I have a manual side opening one made by ONO which is also great, but since I open at least 6 cans of dog food/day, I wanted to go electric."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,I didn't think it would work,"I really didn't think these silicone brushes would work (and I am still skeptical about the ones with fewer, larger bristles). But then I saw Alton Brown using one and thought I'd give them a try. I'm so happy that I bought this one. It actually applies liquids better than my old bristle brush, and you can properly CLEAN it!

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great set so far - get a forearm workout too!,"Really enjoying it, esp the large pan with lid, great for stove top meals.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,Non-stick???,"I bought this pan to replace a Cuisinart pan that I've had for 8 years. First time I used the Calphalon, I tried to cook an omelet. I carefully followed instructions for first use, but nevertheless ended up with egg stuck all over the pan, and it took me 20mins+ to clean it off. Rubbish for nonstick cooking -- though it will probably be good for sauces and deglazin"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,calphalon everyday pan with lid,"I have been using calphalon for 10 years,  but this everyday pan is the best so far.  I love the fact that is has two short handles instead of the usual long one that sticks out.  It is definitely used everyday in our house"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Beautiful and Versatile,"I just cooked the Sauerbraten recipe from Molly Stevens ""All About Braising"" cookbook entirely in this pan.  The results were fabulous. This pan is very versatile since it is quite wide (12"") and deep enough to hold a 4LB chuck roast.  You can crank up the heat to medium high to sear the meat and you will be get that great fond that adds so much taste to the sauce.  The lid fits extremely well so that no braising liquid was lost in the 3 hours that the roast sat in the oven.  The clean up was simple using a Dobie pad with detergent - really as easy as non-stick.  This piece of cookware is so nice looking that we leave it out on the cooktop as kitchen decoration.  So, while a Lodge dutch oven may work almost as well and is a lot cheaper, it can't compare to how great this pan looks in our kitchen."

kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,4.0,"Excellent edge, some design flaws","I baught my 8"" global chef's knife about 5 years ago.  It has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market.  The molybdenum/vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its Henkles/Wustolf counterparts.  My only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style, nor my large hands.  I don't mind the steel handles, although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip.  My main problem is with the tapered bolster, which is almost a lack of bolster altogether.  Coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife, extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Yes, keep the ""Vacation"" switch ON 24/7","Outstanding Coffee Maker - Horrible instructions.  This maker needs an introduction explaining how it works: it appears to maintain a reservoir of warm water that quickly heats fresh water for quick, spray jet drip coffee.  In order to do this YOU MUST KEEP THE VACATION SWITCH ON.  Don't cut it off like 99% of all other coffee makers out there.  Brewing is not triggered until you have poured in the fresh water and then placed the empty carafe back on the burner.  And, it is not really a burner until you turn it on.  If you want the next cup hot you HAVE TO TURN THE WARMER SWITCH ON.  None of this is difficult it is just a different way of brewing.  But ah what a superior brew!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,4.0,Good Deal. Best for Breakfast.,"A small skillets set, bought at $25. I love to use it to cook eggs. Quite durable if you don't over heat (I kill my last calphalon skillet by heat!) or stratch it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great pan,"I love this pan! Makes the perfect single serving size. The first time I used this, I baked single servings of chocolate mousse cake. It was simple to use, and it was pretty easy to clean too. It was really helpful as making single serving chocolate mousse cake before was tedious as I had to use a cookie cutter to shape the cake and mold the mousse. Wish I had bought two instead of one when it was on sale."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,pasta making made easy,I have used a hand crank pasta maker for years.  Recently I used the pasta attachments on a kitchenaid mixer and found that it saved quite a bit of time.  The crank handle always fall off with the other machine but this goes through with ease and you can set it at the speed that works best for you.  Anything that saves time is an asset.

But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around.  It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying.  But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Lovely in red,"I've had this kettle for about a year now and it looks so good on my stove. The handle stays cool and I like the little spout lid flipper.  No burned fingers removing the whistler as on my old kettle. When pouring water, it does tend to splatter, but I've found if I wait a short time, then pour, that doesn't happen."

I have had it a month now and used it to boil the meat off a good sized turky, as well as for several other soups. It seems to hold and disperse heat well. If you like to cook one time, freeze it and eat it all week this is the pot"

They are hard and scratchy.  Had I not washed everything first, I would have returned it.  Also, it looks as if the seams on the pillow case are pulling apart and to make it more obvious, they used white thread on black material.  "

I was able to order 2 for less than the price of 1 of the other video chairs I've looked at.  The chairs are very comfortable.  They are very light weight so they can be moved to take on a trip or for cleaning.  I'm very please with the purchase

Not only that, but they work well!  The peeler..uh... peels like a little jewel... much better than standard ones, and ditto for the zester.  Great f/grating (pun intended!), and the decorative zesting section works well also.  I enjoy scoring lemons f/tea, and vegts. f/salads.  For the $$, you can't go wrong"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,2.0,Not that great!,"My husband bought this machine because it was supposed to be fast and convenient, and with different schedules, easier to brew one cup at a time. It worked fine at first, but now after just 3 weeks it leaks hot water all over the counter. This has happened to both my husband and me so it's not bad technique on our parts. We follow directions exactly, but we keep having to stop it, open the lid, check the pods, reclose the lid and try again. This takes all the convenience out of it especially when you have to clean coffe puddles off your counter. This just isn't acceptable, but it's mostly plastic so probably to be expected. We have used other pods besides the Senseo pods (which don't produce good coffee) but that shouldn't be an issue as they're all the same size. Anyway, we're trashing it and have ordered the Bunn professional which will hopefully do a much better job. I'll let you know in a future review. My advice on this one is either don't buy it or if you do, based on other positive reviews, keep the box and the receipt so you can return it when it starts malfunctioning"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Great product, IF you don't mind the clean-up mess","I stumbled upon this at Wal-Mart.  It works great in my Black & Decker coffee maker.  I have found pre-made pods way too weak even if doubled and they're costly, esp if you double them!  I was so pleased to be able to brew a cuppa strong French roast BUT - BUT - BUT it's a huge PITA cleaning out the pod maker.  I have yet to be able to do it without having to sweep coffee grounds off the floor. I dunno.  Maybe I'm just a klutz with it. "
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Adds Plastic Taste to Coffee,"This coffeemaker has to be carcinogenic. It adds a strong taste of plastic to  the coffee. Most coffeemakers have plastic parts but they do not add a direct plastic taste to the coffee. Also, as the coffee brews, a distinct plastic aroma wafts from the coffeemaker into the room.  "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 6,1.0,The one star is for the cheap price only....,"Get what you pay for, I guess.  I replaced a ratty old Farberware chefs knife that came with a set I got at my wedding.  Boy, I wish I had tested this knife before I tossed out the Farberware... I hate this knife.  It is not balanced at all and it's nearly impossible to make a cut where you want it. I thought maybe it was my lack of skill with knives that was the problem, or maybe my wrist was too weak to properly control the knife.  But then my husband tested the knife, and had the same problem.  The blade feels cheap and flimsy when you are cutting, and moves to where you don't want it.  Even my four year old noticed the blade jump as I cut up an orange.  My advice is stay away from this knife.  Now I'm going to go spend a little more money on a good chef's knife that won't nearly cut my finger off when I use it"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Simply the best,"I sold cookware for 13 years and tried all the ""better"" brands-Calphalon, Chantal, Cuisinart, etc. Every piece of cookware I own is All-Clad LTD. I have had the ten inch non-stick fry pan for 11 years now and it is fantastic, I could not imagine not using it. Browns beautifully at medium tempurature, handle never gets hot. Do not let the prices discourage you, this is truly cookware to buy once to last a lifetime. You will easily go through $140 in inferior frypans before you finally buy this one"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 9,4.0,good machine; DO rinse your rice,"This is a good machine for the price, considering it is also a steamer, and a good one. If all you want is to make rice, any cheaper rice cooker will do. This one's for people who like to make everything in their rice cooker (which is possible in cheaper rice cookers, only there's no rack so you can't steam vegies as easily)."

kitchen & housewares,,1.0,NOT MADE IN ENGLAND,"I also purchased the Churchill China Brook Blue set of 8 (45 pieces) and the completer set, intending to have a matched set of 12. WRONG. The set of 8 was indeed made in England and contained soup bowls (listing on Amazon only says ""bowls""). The set is very nice and has high quality. The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the ""bowls"" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England. Suggestion: if you want consistancy, order two sets of the 45 pieces and don't fool with the add-ons. Amazon could not guarantee the ancillary pieces would be from England.... despite the on-line description to that effect"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,LOVE this kettle!  That's what we say every morning.,"Absolutely a fabulous kettle, great value, quality product, highly recommended!!  I did quite a bit of research prior to making this purchase.  Having spent a good deal of time in the U.K. got spoiled by their kettles that seem to boil water in about 90 seconds!  (Of course they have 220v power.)  This kettle boils water quickly and stays cool on the outside.  The swivel helps if you have a left handed person in a house full of righty's!  The lever to turn it on has a soft touch, you barely have to push it down to turn it on, and the auto-off on boil is perfect as it does not turn off until the water is at a full roaring boil. "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Espresso without costing an arm and a leg,"This machine replaced one I bought at Starbucks, when they sold affordable expresso machines.  Starbucks did figure out that if they sold affordable expresso machines that you would probably buy their coffee, but you would make your $4 latte yourself at home.  When my Starbucks machine died I was aghast at the cost of the expresso machine cost.  Krups is a terrible machine and does not work so I was leary of trying an affordable machine... But, I did try the Capresso machine and this coffee maker - expresso maker is excellent.  Makes great coffee and steams and froths my milk expertly.  Thank you."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 13,5.0,Great Stoneware,I LOVE these products.  The colors are splendid.  They are easy to clean...just throw 'em in the dishwasher with no worries!

kitchen & housewares,37 of 38,5.0,Finally--a real latte at home!,"Worth the $$$.  I'd been served enough crappy ""lattes"" (scalded milk and watery espresso) at coffeehouses with cheap machines to know that I wasn't going to bother with a budget machine.  I had also tried using one of those hand pump milk frothers with espresso from a cheap machine or a shot of coffee from one of those little Vietnamese drip devices.  The results were a mediocre coffee beverage-not a real latte.  (Though if it's a Vietnamese iced coffee you want, then that Vietnamese drip device is excellent.)   When I decided to look for an espresso machine, I first tried the Cook's Illustrated review of good espresso machines under $200.  I would've gone for one of those but the article was out of date and none of the models reviewed were available any longer.  Then I found Nadav Caine's Amazon guide and got the Gaggia based on his recommendations.  The price turned me off, but it's true that the machine will soon pay for itself given that I was spending $4.00 at Starbucks every day.  It does take some time to learn to make a good shot of espresso and steam milk well, and I'm still learning, but even while improving my technique, I've been enjoying lattes every bit as good as Starbucks' ever since getting this machine.

kitchen & housewares,7 of 10,4.0,Good Value,"Recently bought this 3-piece set to supplement some more expensives pans I was buying to replace those I have that have simply worn out.  While their weight/quality was not equal to the others I bought their cost was far less.  They are well balanced, of reasonable thickness with decent heat distribution and I can simply toss them in the dishwasher (not the case with the other, pricey pans I bought).  For overall functionality, ease of use, and cooking performance, I thought this set was a very good value.  Would recommend for easy clean up, everyday use"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great value for the price,"I've had other bread machines that didn't work half as well as this one does.  Whatever you do, don't use the manual, or you'll never have a good loaf of bread.  (I don't measure my flour by the cup..I weigh it instead,"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Home Made Yogurt,"The yogurt maker is very convenient; a Ziploc 1-qt twist-top container fits inside perfectly so I can make several batches without having to use/wash the Salton jar. The odd-shaped plastic measuring spoon is kinda silly, but my little nephew can use it at the beach next summer. (A regular spoon works better to measure the starter yogurt."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,"Makes great smoothies, for two weeks only","Consumer Reports rates this as number one for making smoothies, and it is a great blender, sort of.  The only problem is its engineering.  The connection between the rotors and the powerful  motor are all flimsy plastic and break easily.  I noticed how thin the plastic connections were when I first upened the box and was apprehensive.  Nevertheless it made great smoothies for about two weeks, then when grinding up a banana and some rasberries, the white teflon teeth on the bottom of the rotor broke.  If you live in San Antonio, forget warranty repair, it has to go to Corpus Christie. Not!  This is a bad product. Poorly engineered and unreliable"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 11,2.0,Was hoping for better,"I have just started cooking on a regular basis. The Hard-Anodized cookwar looks cool and more importantly cooks evenly and true (they conduct heat really well). The only thing is I can't get them clean, even after the first use. I hand washed them with a sponge and they look clean when they are wet. Then I dry them and they look like crap. The pans are smooth and clean, but they don't look clean, there is a weired blochiness. The brochure says to use ajax to bring them back to new, but I don't have the guts to try it. Also you have to be real carefull or everything will stick. I didn't return them, they work, but I would buy something else. (like calphalon one for three times the price?"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Very nice juicer :),I just got this juicer and it seems very suitable for the job. Usage and cleaning are very convenient. The design is very simple and elegant. And the unit is light enough to move around. It's not going to be a permanent counter top piece since it's very big. Looks like it would last for a while. 
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,4.0,There is nothing like the smell of fresh bread to wake up to in the morning.,I really enjoy this machine as it seems to work well with all of the different recipes I have tried so-far. I really enjoy the fact that it has so many programing options for different varities of bread and dough. It is also a very attractive appliance that will complement any kitchen. My only complaint is that sometimes there will be a small amount of dough that doesn't mix well in the corners of the baking tub
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,A Perfect Machine.,"I'd planned to get the small Dyson, but the reviews of this vacuum persuaded me to give it a try. It's absolutely excellent. It's the best handheld vacuum I've ever tried, and I've thrown more of these things away than I can remember. Fortunately, I've always saved the attachments. Sometimes they fit another model, sometimes they don't. Since there's no fancy coupling required to attach tools to the hose end of this one, its just friction, most fit it."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,love it!,"I love this kettle! Seems the other reviewers have covered the reasons why. I will say that this kettle was a replacement for an older model whose lid broke. I contacted Breville about the broken lid, and had a replacement within 10 days. Now, that is great service"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Well worth the money,"We eat a lot of fruits and vegetables so much peeling is done at home. We have Oxo and Wusthof peelers, both of which seemed just fine until I was cooking at a friend's house and was able to try Rosle's. There really is no comparison: the balance is absolutely perfect, which makes a swivel-head unecessary. And yes, the pointed tip and razor-sharp cutting edges are fantastic: My friend's peeler is 10 years old and the cutting edges are still much sharper and precise than mine, which are only 1 and 3 years old. And she keeps it in an unorganized drawer knocking around with ladles and other metal objects; it doesn't have any nicks or scratches on it despite the abuse."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great oven thermometer,"I use this for baking polymer clay items in a toaster oven. Polymer clay requires very precise temperatures, and the typical dial oven thermometers were not only very very slow to register temp changes, but also inaccurate.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Won't hurt your expensive knives!,"This particular board is made with the end-grain facing up - a must for those of you who have an investment in your cutting utensils.  With the end grain up, your knives will not ""cut"" the board rather, they'll ""slip between"" the fibers thus protecting the ever important sharp edge of your knives."
kitchen & housewares,17 of 18,5.0,Great and Convienent,This Iron works great.  No leaks and the retractable cord is the greatest.  I bought this Iron when it was Brand-new about 3 years ago and paid way more then it is now.  It is a steal.... You should not pass it up!!!  It has auto shut off and will do so when left in the done position or when it falls.  It also cools relatively fast.   Enjoy
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Retro Toaster!,"I have been using this toaster for about 3 weeks. It looks great in my kitchen and works very well. I have learned that I have to put it at a lower setting than I did for my last toaster so I don't get toast that is too dark. The racks inside prevent the bread from touching the heating elements. The crumb trays are removable and easy to keep clean, but they should have put them in the front. I have to lift the toaster to get to them. It isn't that big of a deal but it could have been designed in a more efficient manner. I have even toasted croissants in it using the bagel setting. It is the most I have ever paid for a toaster, but I think it was worth it. It is well made and doesn't look cheap at all. Another great feature is that the top and sides are made of what looks like brushed chrome with NO plastic housing near the slots, so one doesn't have to worry about the housing going into meltdown. My last toaster did that and it looked awful, which is why I bought this one. I can easily recommend this toaster with a clear conscience"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 19,1.0,You need to DRILL into your wall (or tile) to install this!,"The product arrives without any good directions and unfortunately requires that you drill into your bathroom/shower walls to install it. We have a tiled shower, and I don't want to drill holes in the tile to install an a shower ""arc"". Our previous Wal-Mart grade shower bar has rubber ends and adjusts to securely fit in our shower. I wish Amazon would have provided a better warning as to the nature of the installation before advertising this product so aggressively. I guess this falls into the ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" category. If they could have developed an adhesive based alternative to securing the bar ends, then maybe I could have given it a bona fide try. Too bad"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent and worthy product...,"I just love it... Exactly what I was looking for. Very unique in design, stylish and practical at the same time. A little bit pricy, but very much worth it... Thanks for a great design..."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Deliciously fun and functional!,"I have always loved the utility of cooking with cast-iron and until now, have never enjoyed having to look at it in my kitchen! This whimsical but tenacious vessel is ideal for roasting, stewing or baking and its seemingly edible, candy-apple, gloss-enameled finish and sleek stainless-steel leaf-shaped handle present beautifully on any table-top or sideboard. Whether on your stove or as a gift, this will surely be the most appealing piece of cookware you encounter"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,"Rubbish, absolutely Rubbish","Wish I could give this item 0 stars, I guess one star will have to  do."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great little measuring cups,I really appreciate every aspect of these fantastic measuring cups. 
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,As advertised.,"Solid knife with a good feel.  I got it as a freebie with the Chef's Knife, so the price was right for me, but I use it often and it has held up well"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Beautiful, ","Heavy with strong, rich colors..  a nice serving plate for a crowd ... or I use it for fruit on the table"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great little gadget,This timer is really useful. It can be placed almost anywhere in a busy kitchen. It allows to time long intervals which are essential   for cakes & roasts. The three channels capacity is soooo useful for anyone keeping tabs on a number of jobs. It is easy to use and it's robust. It may not be the cheapest - but hey! You're worth it !
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Plates,"The Corelle Winter Frost White plates have a simple, clean look. They match any kitchen. They are fairly sturdy, unless you drop them on very hard tile. However, they remain relatively light"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,not very effective,Works okay (not great but is not ergonomic and heavy leading to wrist fatigue quickly. I got it for $9 on closeout so can't really complain but wouldn't recommend it even at that price
kitchen & housewares,5 of 9,5.0,Tips for all Traits,The tips for cake decorating is wonderful. To offer them at this price is also wonderful. I really like the idea of shopping from home. I don't know anyone here and don't know my way around. I love to bake cakes and decorate  them and so to try to find places to buy this tips and bags is very hard.  You make it so easy for me to enjoy something I like to do. The tips come  so that you can make a array of designs on your  cake and other foods like  crackers
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,1.0,Verry disappointed ,I was very disappointed with this machine. I tried it on several separate occasions.  I could not get a soft serve texture. I even placed the ice cream mixture in the freezer for 20 minutes before attempting to make the ice cream. I let it mix for 30 minutes before calling it quits.  It also takes a lot of room in the freezer and I found that the unit was too tall to fit between the counter and the cabinets.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Spatula,"I use this all the time.  Like others said, it is just PERFECT! The handle is sturdy, the design is smooth, and the silicone is just right- it is not too sloppy or too firm.  I use this to mix stuff and to scrape the bowl after mixing.  It seems to be somewhat nonestick also.  The best thing was that it came free with my classic stand mixer.  If you need a spatula...this is the one to get"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,5.0,Baker's Rack,These cooling racks are great!  The space between each square is small enough so that your cookies don't fall through
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,GREAT BUY,"I WAS LUCKY TO PURCHASE TWO OF THESE WHEN IT WAS ON SALE.  WOW, WHAT A GREAT BUY!  SINCE IT IS A HOLIDAY ITEM, I HAVE NOT USED YET, BUT LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THIS DINNERWARE GRACE MY TABLE AT CHRISTMAS.  WELL WORTH THE PRICE"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,4.0,"Great, but heavy","This skillet has worked great, but it has 2 drawbacks:  1) it's HEAVY and 2) it creates a lot of smoke."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great little pan,"This pan is the perfect-sized stir-fry pan for an individual or a couple.  The non-stick surface is very easy to clean.  The pan itself is quite heavy for its size but I believe the weight is conducive to its efficient cooking ability.  As someone mentioned before, the base of the pan is small, which makes the pan somewhat unstable but you can just hold on to the handle as you're cooking.  Overall, this ia a great buy, especially considering its low price.  (I purchased the pan for $15.99 so watch for sales)"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Cheap and reliable,This timer is perfect for an automatic pet feeder that I have.  The timer that came with the feeder was inconsistent and would lose memory of its progams on a regular basis.  This Timex timer is perfect.  It can hold more schedules than I know what to do with and you can program down to 1 minute increments
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,25 years and counting,"It's hard to find something new to say about Le Creuset that all other reviewers haven't. So I'm going to focus on clean-up and sturdiness. One of my favorite uses for this pot is polenta. That's right: nasty, sticky, constant-stirring polenta that sticks to everything and hardens to near-stone status if not cleaned immediately. I make a batch about once a week and keep it in the fridge for quick meals or snacks. Once the Le Creuset pot has cooled, I put it in the sink with a little Dawn and warm water and let it soak, then use a plain old plastic scraper for the tough bits and sponge off the rest. And that's it."
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,4.0,Beautiful But Messy,"My husband purchased for me this lovely red Kitchen Aid coffee mill for Christmas.  It grinds coffee with excellence but it is a bit messy.  The way it is designed has coffee shooting out of a spout.  If the spout clogs...which happens frequently, coffee sprays everywhere.  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Flatware care,"A head's up to those of you who didn't like this flatware...you can't use lemon or citrus scented soap on stainless steel, otherwise it will pit and stain....I followed those instructions and it's serving me quite well.."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Flour Sifter Replacement,"A friend, who is a chef, recommended using a strainer instead of a traditional flour sifter. This one is large enough to work beautifully and takes up less space than having a strainer and a sifter in your kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Terrible!,"I bought this because the ratings were quite good considering the price.  First of all ... if you are looking for something that will help remove spots .. consider something else!!!!  I went over and over and over spots, and they still remain. I realize that this is not a ""spot bot"", although a steam cleaner should definitely take care of the problem -- especially onne with rotating brushes.  Secondly, the tank is extremely small.  It is about 1/4 of the size of cleaners that you rent from the store.  I thought that I wouldn't be too upset if it didn't work as expected, although now that I have it, I definitely am!  I would not recommend buying it for even $10.00 (which is $9.99 too much)!  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent product,This cookware is easy to use and also reasonable. I bought it only for 59.99 a few weeks late
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Classic winner,This french press is a classic winner.  It is small enough where i can take it with me on my trip so i can have a nice strong cup a coffee in my hotel room instead of the weak nasty stuff they provide for you
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Just like the Dairy Queen!,"Buy some of that Junket ice cream mix, follow the instructions, put it in your Ice-45 and wait, not too long you will have soft serve as good or better than the Dairy Queen. Not too sweet, just right. And the great thing is, you can do it twice with the bowl that they give you, the darn thing stays that cold. The negatives, it needs a bit more capacity, and don't use their recipes unless you really like it sweet. We love it!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,these plates chip very easily,"We bought this dinnerwear set and within the first month 3 of the bowels had chips on the edge.  I think they are very attractive dishes, but they are not worth the money"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,gotta love Le Creuset!,"I got my first 3 qt. Le Creuset pot a few years ago and just use it for everything!!  saw this pumpkin one and just had to get it!!  it's a tad bit smaller and because of the pumpkin shape it's awkward when stirring but it's so pretty, who cares?!!  is a beautiful holiday addition to my kitchen"
kitchen & housewares,55 of 56,5.0,great results,"I have used several irons over a period of 25 years of marriage. I usually buy the least expensive ones, but this time I decided to splurge on myself and buy a Rowenta.  I am so glad that I did as it was one of my best investments.  It makes my ironing a breeze.  I do quilting and I love the steam and the large water capacity.  It is a great iron - I wished I had bought it years earlier"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 8,5.0,So versatile and great!,"As a new apartment dweller I would rank this right up there....its so great, classic looks, cleans easily and you can use it to make all sorts of recipes....goes with all decor and it looks great when taking just a casserole dish to a party or gathering....great purchase and I'm so satisfied"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Wonderful gadget,"I love my microplane. I use it to grate citrus peel, chocolate, hard cheeses (note: it yields a very fine grate. If you like a coarser grate, use a traditional grater. The micro plane coarse and extra coarse graters still grate way more finely than a normal grater). Unlike other reviewers, I like the fact that it doesn't have a handle. It gives you more surface area to do your grating and it doesn't feel uncomfortable in the least in my hands. I honestly don't know what they are talking about! I've never came even close to shaving my knuckles. I love the fact that it's dishwasher safe, too. Very convenient. This particular grater is not sharp enough to grate things like ginger and nutmeg, however, so I have a different microplane for that. If it weren't for that, this would be a perfect gadget."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Worth the Wait!,"Took me a while to save for this machine, but it was well worth the time & money! (I still do not admit to friends and family how much I paid!)"
kitchen & housewares,27 of 27,5.0,Nice LARGE griddle!,"I love making pancakes. In the past I would use two large cast-iron skillets for the task. I found myself constantly adjusting my burner temperature and I would always get a few very dark (or burnt) or a few undercooked pancakes out of each batch. Plus I could only cook two pancakes at a time; one in the center of each skillet (I like making large, perfectly round, 5-6"" diameter pancakes.)"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Nice piece of cookware,This roaster is a nice weight and the non-stick surface made it a breeze to clean even baked on food.  Excellent product
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Great pan - but too small,"I was really disappointed when I received this pan.  It is the smallest ""10 inch"" pan I've ever seen, and not very practical.  I would return it, but it instantly became the best quality pan I own,and I will try to find some use for it.  Save your money and buy the 12 inch!  Also, [...] is a slow shipper.  But hey, the pan was 70% off, so who can complain"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Makes great cookies...,"I love the pan for cookies, but that is all I have used it for. They slide right off; however, the pan is heavy and slightly awkward to handle when hot"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 14,5.0,Kitchenaid Quality,"I love Kitchenaid, I buy everything except their appliances.  I also have a red set of stainless cookware and bought this nonstick set because their are complimentary and can share lids.  The color is great and I have not had any problems with Kitchenaid cookware in the past.  The handles stay cool and the set seems very sturdy.  I doubt I will have any problems as I only use plastic utensils and hand wash only.  The nonstick is very nice and seems to be much higher quality than my previous TFal set"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,expensive but worth every bit,"It took me time to decide for Le Creuset, especially for the price, but now I am using it every day, so easy to clean and so neat to use from the top of the stove to the oven"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 11,4.0,unbelievable price,Same thing at Sears was $100.  Amazon has it for $49 & free shipping
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A Pleasure to Use,"As a kid, I would eat bagles toasted with melted cheddar on top every morning.  I had a great cheese slicer with a thin, round, wooden handle and loved it.  Stocking my own kitchen, I wanted to get a cheese slicer that was as enjoyable to use.  Some slicers can be annoyingly dull, slice in a way that leaves cheese stuck to the slicer, slice unevenly, slice too thin/thick, or be uncomfortable to work with for long endeavors.  This slicer has none of these problems."
kitchen & housewares,27 of 28,5.0,"A fabulous, all around ktichen workhorse ","I couldn't decide: the 3 quart saute, sauce, or saucier.  "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Tasty Treats - Mix them UP!,I have had this model for about 4-5 years.  Before I purchased this I had a 5-quart KitchenAid Artesian mixer that I got for a wedding present in 1992.  
kitchen & housewares,15 of 16,5.0,Great Sucking Power,"It was good to see Hoover finally use the same hose for both the main vacuum and the attachments. Powerful, easy to use. Our other Hoover was great when using the main vacuum, but had little sucking power when the attachments were used. A GREAT improvement. We are HAPPY with it"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,2.0,Disappointing,"It looks nice.  It does not toast very evenly, typically get one edge burned another not toasted. "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Near perfect,"I have been cooking heavily for family and friends, as well as professionally, for going on 20 years now.  I recently re-outfitted my kitchen and I have been experimenting with various cooking surfaces, utensil finishes, and product designs (it's a hobby of mine to play in the kitchen).  This is one little gem of a skillet.  Although it has Titanium in the product name, that is the FINISH of the pan, not the material from which it is constructed.  In other words, don't expect to get a light pan, as this sucker weighs a ton!  Its heat distribution is nicely diffused throughout the cooking surface, and its non-stick surface is of suitably high quality to make this an every-day utility pan.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,5.0,FANTASTIC CHILLERS,"I have got these drinks chillers and I find them absolutely terrific at keeping your drink ice cold. Rather than using them to chill the can/bottle I find them most effective for keeping them ice cold for as long as I need, or as long as the drink lasts!!  They're also great for picnics and on the go"
kitchen & housewares,23 of 23,4.0,Some experimentation may be in order,"Using a rice cooker should be easy - otherwise, why plunk down the money for it? This Zojirushi is user-friendly only after some experimentation since the manual contains almost no information about how to use it. However, since I've finally found the right procedure (as I'll share later), I've been pleased with its performance."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,nice to use,"I have never used a spade to scoop ice cream, and i was not sure how i would like it.  But now i love it.  it is so much easier to use than the old fasioned scoop.  you dont have to dip it in hot water to help the ice cream come out easier.  i would recommend this product to anyone to loves ice cream"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 12,2.0,"Oh-so-cute, but not particularly useful.","I first purchased these because I needed pot holders, so I was surprised when they arrived to see that they would only cover one finger at a time. (NOT THE MANUFACTURER'S FAULT). Having admitted that embarrassing piece of information,  I still don't find them useful.  Unlike other reviewers, I dont' feel comfortable leaving the handle holder on while cooking (I have a gas oven)and trying to put them on after the skillet has been on the stove defeats the purpose."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Handy & Versatile,I found the Hamilton Beach Power Deluxe Hand Mixer to be handy & versatile. Its light to hold but powerful enough to do the job. Its comes with two different styles of attachements which fit nicely in bottom of snap-on storage case(no more searching for the beaters at the last minute & which makes the mixer itself easier to store.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,perfect coffee and super fast,"Perfect machine.  Fill up the water tank (once a week for just me) put a pod in the top, close it and press a button. If you can't figure that out, then go back to paper and pencil and get off the computer! "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 12,5.0,Ummm..... it's a gravy separator,How much can be said about a gravy separator?  It works as expected
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Hard to beat a KitchenAid appliance,"I purchased 2 Black and Decker blenders from Target and neither lasted more than 2 weeks. They would start to smell hot than shut down for good. The KitchenAid works really well with ice cream drinks. The ice cream doesn't seem to stick to the side like the glass ones, maybe it has more to do with the blades. The base is very heavy. You do need to hold down on the mixer when doing anything thick or heavy, it tends to pop up."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Good if used for what it was intended,"Don't expect to do large spaces.  Perfect for a small, cluttered home office, especially if you have pets.  Empty dust cup often and there is plenty of suction.  Long cord a plus.  "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 10,4.0,Not a fast food drive thru but they do work!!!,"I have read many of the reviews and all I can say is:  I have used these bags for comforter sets, summer/winter clothing, xtra pillows, hanging clothes(off their hangers), xtra sheet sets, our camping sleeping bags, quilting projects and atleast six trips by car and by plane - I THINK THEY ARE GREAT!!!  They are not a stuff, suck and throw product.  If you do not overstuff - are willing evenly zip the zipper being careful to start at the very end and completely remove the air and seal imediately - you will have sealed your stuff indefinitely!  I cannot wait to try the newest hanging ones.  So if you are one of the few people not in a hurry, expecting immediate gratification for a rushed job - go for it, you will love 'em"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,1.0,Does KitchenAid know this grater is mediocre?,"I received this grater as a Christmas gift, and the following August it broke.  I stripped the plastic screw that holds the handle to the grating barrel.  And all I did was unscrew it for cleaning!  If these reviews don't get your attention, let the amount of plastic on this grater send up red flags.  Why would the part receiving so much torque ever be made of plastic?!?  I am curious to see how KitchenAid will handle my complaint, since I can't find this product anywhere on their website, and a search for it comes up empty.  Not a good sign.."

kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Great Kitchen Tool,"This is a fantastic tool for your kitchen. I purchased one on the advice from a chef friend, and it has been great for steaming vegetables.  In particular I loved the sweet potatoes that I've made using this steamer.  Extremely easy to use"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,1.0,Not Worth It,"I have been making pasta for years.  So when I received the Professional 5 for a gift, I wanted to get the pasta attachment to make it easier on my hands.  Was I wrong. Since it was their equipment, I used their recipe.  I put the flat noodle plate in and  40 minutes later, I still did not have decent noodles.  The holes in the plate are too narrow for the dough to pass through without overtaxing the motor on the mixer. It got very hot.  I did not buy the pasta maker to ruin my mixer."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Awesome time saver!,"It's so great to be able to make my latte before I leave the house. I don't have to waste 15 minutes going to Starbucks (except when I'm low on beans.) A $10 bag will make many, many servings. Plus, this way I don't have to worry about it being too weak, as sometimes happens."
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Not so great,I received this set with the handle of the small pan broken.  The pans scratch easily and are very lightweight
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0, Nice Quality Dinnerware,"I am very pleased with this dinnerware.  The plates, bowls. and cups are generously sized.  The black interiors are really classy.  The color is a little redder than I expected.  It would be great if they offered a patterned dinnerware set in coordinating colors."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Corning Ware prettier but isn't as strong as it used to be!,"I love the plates and mugs and bowls. All are in a great size and the square plates provide a great background for food. HOWEVER, the first time I washed them in the dishwasher one of the plates chipped.  It hasn't happened since, but ruined the ""set.""  Since it was placed properly in the dishwasher all I can assume is that there was a factory  weakness in the rim of that particular plate"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,4.0,Glad I bought these knives,"After lots of online comparisons, I bought this set.  They are an excellent qualify, cut great, and having six steak knives for the table and prep knives for the kitchen all in one place is very convenient. I like how they look and feel to use.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the block was stainless as well. "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Old Fashioned Is Sometimes As Good As It Gets,"I hadn't used an old-fashioned percolator-type coffee maker for many, many years. I mainly bought this one to take on a cruise (cruise ship coffee is undrinkable sludge)and gave it a couple of dry runs over the weekend. It couldn't be easier to use, and made four (small) cups of great coffee in the same time it took to brew a full pot in our $200 Capresso machine. Its size is perfect for packing away and using in a hotel room or cruise ship cabin, for a dorm room, office or anywhere else where space is limited"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,No more pressing problems!,"This is the best garlic press I've had. It has a roomy ""bowl"" that allows for a couple of large cloves at a time and the cleaner is a whiz!  I wouldn't try using it without peeling the garlic as some have said you could, but I love it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Just what I was looking for,These whisks are a great product.  They are well-made yet light weight and comfortable to use.  This product is just what I was looking for in a set of whisks
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Terrible quality....poor repair options,"Not only is this product over-priced, poorly designed and highly inefficient, but its components are very poor quality.  The most recent problem is that the toaster timer mechanism broke...after no more than 3 months of use.  When we called DeLonghi, they directed us to a ""repair center"" about 20 miles away.  Very frustrating.  Unfortuntately, I can't recommend any other product, but I'd avoid paying a premium for this one"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Professional quality with a fixable defect....,"I picked this up cheap at a thrift store, and have been very happy with it.  The nonstick surface is very thick, the stainless(?) surface is heavy duty, the frame is rock solid, and it cooks quick.  It also does a good job of balancing the top half when you press down on a sandwich.  From a build perspective, it seems like it was made for restaurant use.  In terms of making Paninis this thing is awesome."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,top notch glasses,"i received these glasses as a christmas gift and i could not have been more pleased - they are of a great size and not flimsy at all, vey sturdy, easy to hold, classy and elegant glasses - in a funky, retro sort of way. They will be perfect for my up and coming retro martini party - the set that i received included 8 glasses and cost about $100, so you won't find a better deal - these are beautiful glasses."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Experience Speaks,"I'm not sure why ""Grass Tiger"" had such bad results with this product line.

kitchen & housewares,0 of 3,1.0,damaged items,"I ordered this item along with other items, shipping and handling were not to be added because all items were labeled free shipping if I ordered 25.00 or more, which I did. I have been charged shipping and handling on the two largest items this being one of them. When I received this item the magarita glassed were damanged. I cant get any response from emailing to try and get credited back for the shipping charge and now I have a defected gift that I will have to return"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Omega 4000 juicer,"I was a serious cyclist about six years ago and used a ""Juiceman Junior"" three times a day five days a week. I was initially impressed with the unit, especially for the price. Around a year later the bearings in the Juiceman gave up. About this same time, I was married and life took over. Now, seven years later I am looking to get back into cycling and juicing. I have looked at the Omega 4000 several times and compared it with others. I decided on this unit over others based on other reviews and the warranty. I used this unit as soon as it came in. I am happy to say that it performs beautifully. Rather quiet compared to the Juiceman, if I recall correctly. The pulp ejection worked fine and was much dryer compared to that (I feed product in rather slow) ejected from the juiceman. Clean up is no different from what I remember. In my opinion clean up is still too time consuming. Other than making the unit entirely out of stainless, I don't know how it could be easier to clean. If your as picky as me about ""clean"" a toothbrush works well for the mesh basket. One shot of seven carrots stained the plastic parts as I expected. I am sure by following the provided cleaning tips this can be removed. Plastic parts are; however, far more sturdy than the Juiceman. The juice produced from the Omega 4000 is fantastic, very light on ""texture"" or pulp. I have been rather hesitant on spending money on another juicer, but hopefully I have made the right choice. Others have commented on good customer support from Omega, that is encouraging. Out of the starting gate I am impressed with the performance of the Omega 4000. We will see what happens in the future, I intend to give this unit a workout! Don't get me wrong the Juiceman is a fair juicer for occasional use, especially for the price. If you are a serious juicer look elsewhere, possibly the Omega 4000"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,5.0,Great Rice Cooker!!!,Great rice cooker.  Cooks brown rice with no effort as well.  Highly recommeded
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,A Sharp Item For The Table,My old steak knives were flimsy and worn so when I shopped for new ones I wanted knives that were solidly made by a top-rated company like Henckels. The price was right so I bought two sets. I think I should have bought 3 sets. They are always sharp and my guests remark on the quality of the knives at meals. I even use them sometimes when I am doing prep work. These would be a great gift item too

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Christmas gift,Was very pleased to find this product on amazon.com.  I found them on sale at Kohl's and after calling and driving to several stores could not find the colors I wanted.  My daughter said to check Amazon and there I found all the colors I wanted and also they were less expensive.  Very very pleased.
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Great item-- LOVE the Logic finish. Worth the extra money.,"If you're reading this, you probably already know about camp dutch ovens. I've been a Boy Scout my whole life, and a Scoutmaster and adult leader for several years now... (and an avid camper and outdoor cook to boot.) I have owned 5 or 6 dutch ovens in my life, and I'm now convinced that there is no match for the quality of LODGE dutch ovens.  They are worth paying a little extra for. The others aren't really worth buying-- the cheaper ones don't keep a finish like the LODGE ovens do."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Best purchase I have made in awhile,"Simple to use, easy to clean, great results, inexpensive, takes up small space on the counter - I LOVE IT"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Very High Quality Pan!,"This pan has a thick, durable non-stick finish and is a very heavy gauge metal. It is surprisingly heavy for its size. If you're looking for a very serious quality pan at a good price, this can't be beat. It could be the last 9x9 pan you buy"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,There is nothing here not to like...,"Except, perhaps, for the list price, there is nothing to improve upon with these fine mixing bowls. I chanced across a set in a mustard colored hue not presently listed here and got a major discount... so I have nothing but praise for the set.  The ceramic is dense and solid, with a bell-like ring and a formidable resistance to chipping and cracking.  The glaze is smooth, easy to clean inside and out, and simply beautiful. And the three nesting sizes cover perfectly the full range a moderately sized family will need. Pyrex would work as well, perhaps, but in between uses, these Emile Henry bowls can be proudly kept in plain sight!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,You'll be dissapointed,"My wife and I were super excited to get this set as a wedding gift.  The pans look beautiful and we were eager to start using some great cookware.  The first dissapointing thing was that the color didn't last a single day.  As soon as you start using these pans they start discoloring and forming unsightly spots.  Yes, this can be polished out, but you'll be spending a lot of time on it, and you're not likely to keep it up.  The second, and by far the biggest dissapointment is that these pans really don't cook food well.  I have tried every trick in the book and can not for the life of me cook an egg in these pans without it sticking.  The calphalon website reccomends various techniques, none of which worked for us.  Lastly, you'll see many mentions of how fast your food will cook in these pans... which is also not true.  You're constantly reminded to use a low heat setting, or else your food will stick (which it will either way), so you end up cooking your food much longer than you're used to.  Also, calphalon reccomends that refrigerated foods sit out for 10-15 minutes before adding them into a pan to prevent sticking (which also doesn't work).  At the end of the day, trying to cook something in these pans takes a long time."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,1.0,Terrible leaking problem & terrible customer service,I have always bought Mr. Coffee & have always had problems.  This is no different.  After a while it leaks out the bottom.  This is our 3rd one this one is as bad as the other two.  Customer service was no help at all.  Borderline rude & pretty much call us liars.  I will be throwing out this maker & telling friends & family not to buy Mr. Coffee.  I'm going to try another brand and I don't know why it took me this long to see a substandard product and stop buying from them

It was a pain to read them and only then realize they don't really contain enough information to solve any problems.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,Awesome Awesome,"I was able to purchase this at another retailer for a steal as it was on clearance.  This item is so awesome!  Im not sure why someone gave it one star...you can take it back if you only used it 5 times and its covered under warranty, OR if not they could have called KitchenAid and they would have been able to help to get it replaced. Alas, it was problably just abuse.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Good quality pan that doesn't stick,"You can't tell from the pictures, but this pan is very heavy. The cast aluminum heats evenly and the cakes bake well. I was worried that cakes would stick to this pan, since it has so much detail. That hasn't been a problem. I just butter and flour the pan, then let it cool for twenty minutes before removing the cake. It comes out beautifully everytime. I was amazed. A dusting of powdered sugar or cocoa is all you need to decorate it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,I Love This Oven!,"Recently I did some research on the internet regarding toaster/oven/broiler-convection style ovens. I decided upon the TOB-165 Cuisinart and I have been happy from the time I took it out of the box. I have adapted some of my recipes for main dishes to the oven. It cooks in half the time the big gas oven does. And garlic toast, wow! It is very easy to clean; a simple wipe up with a non-abrasive cleaner and it is back to looking new again. It will really come in handy this coming Thanksgiving with handling side dishes. Now I plan on purchasing a food processor and I believe it will definitely be a Cuisinart. I do not find the crumb tray a problem. Some people do not like the way it has to be removed from the back. This is a sweet appliance. My son sent it to me with a card saying, ""Happy Cooking,"" and it has been"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,My favorite pan,"I have a growing set of All Clad, and this is the pan I get the most use out of. It is completely nonstick, and the surface is as tough as nails. I cook delicate fish with it, and never have a problem. I often use it without any oil or anything, it's appropriate (and yummy!) to cook on it dry. Nothing every sticks to it, and cleanup is a snap. I will wash with warm water and/or deglaze, and it's good as new. "
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,4.0,Decent pan/wok,"I just used this pan on my smooth-top electric stove.  The base of this pan fits the small burner on the stove.  I imagine that the cast iron wok is the best type to use, but I didn't want to go that route.  Now, when I was looking for a stainless steel type, I focused on how the aluminum was placed in the pan; either just in base, or up the sides as well.  The Calphalon stainless steel wok, has the aluminum up the sides (the All-Clad does as well, but not in the same price range), but no lid.  I chose this model, but I was concerned that the wok would not get hot enough without the aluminum in the sides.   As I suspected, the sides did not get hot, and when I lifted the pan to toss the food, the sizzling slowed or stopped, indicating the pan was not retaining the heat (that's where the cast-iron shines).  I tried to remedy the problem by closing the lid, and letting the vegetables steam a bit.  The food came out fine though, and I'm not sure how important the sides need to be hot, since all the food in a wok generally does not touch the pan at the same time anyway, and gets tossed or stirred (thus the title ""stir-fry"").  Nothing stuck to the pan, and clean up should be easy.  To sum up, I don't believe that this wok will be used by any professional chef, but might be good enough for the home. "
kitchen & housewares,38 of 38,5.0,The 'Professional' is worth it! ,"This is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased, but the  only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to.  The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line.  With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Corelle Livingware Abundance Review ,I really like my corelle livingware abundance set.  The new corelle is sturdier than the earlier versions.  I like the lip edges on the plates food doesn't slid off as easily and it is nice for children to scoop up their food.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Junk,"Probe stopped working during the fourth use. I was checking for a replacement probe when I read about others having the same problem. Well, now I'll just throw it away and get a traditional leave-in type. Sure, I may add a few minutes to my cooking time, but I think its better than using an inaccurate and problematic device. I could replace the probe, but how many of you have seen replacement blades for a Wusthof? Exactly"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,The Vittle Vault is Great,"The Vittle Vault is the best product I purchased in all of 2005.  The dry dog food I buy has some moisture in it and it would dry out when left in the bag.  I had been trying lots of things to keep it from drying out.  I tried storage bins but they are not air tight.  I tried putting press and seal plastic wrap on the storage bins.  Nothing worked.  I finally found the Vittle Vault and I am thrilled with it.  After telling a neighbor, she bought one too because she keeps her dry dog food on her screened porch and the ants would get in it.  She says, no more ants.  (I keep my dry dog food in the kitchen.)  I bought the 30 lb size and it easily holds my 20 lb bag of dog food when it's still a quarter full.  I really like pouring the whole bag in at once and throwing the big bag away.  This is a great product. "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,1.0,TERRIBLE!,This blender DID NOT work on a measly smoothie.  The design of the carafe may be the problem.  Blenders with a funnel-shaped carafe work best because the motor creates a tornado-like suction that moves everything to the center and down.  This Waring blender has a straigt-sided carafe.  I had to use a spoon EVERY time to get a smooth result... and ice?  Forget it!  I sent mine back and ended up getting a Black and Decker $39 one from Target and LOOOOVE it

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Oxo brand comes through again,"I've always found that Oxo brand products for the kitchen are top notch, and these corn holders are no exception.  I was surprised to see that they are even heftier than I'd expected.  The size ensures it's easy for anyone to hold whether that be children, men with large hands, or even people who suffer from arthritis or other hand problems. And the rubber gripping makes hanging onto the holders easy even with buttery fingers.  One of the more ingenious parts is the length of the prongs; Oxo had the common sense to make one prong longer than the other to ensure that both prongs come in contact with the peaked shape of the ear of corn.  I highly recommend these"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Some caveats here...,"If the alarm worked--on my unit, it does not--I would have given this five stars. Since it does not, I have to stay nearby to ""catch"" the change in the cooking sound when the water runs out; that's what stops the cooking.  I regard this limitation as a worthwhile tradeoff for eggs perfectly cooked to my doneness preference. I found the 'keep warm' function to be unhelpful. There is enough heat retained in the base, even when the switch is turned totally off (middle setting), that the eggs continue to cook. "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Simply devine,"At just over $20 bucks this wine cooler is amazing. Good looking, yes, but so easy too! Don't bother doing what we did at first, trying to pre-chill it with ice or keep it in the freezer. Doesn't work, doesn't help. Simply stick your chilled bottle in this cooler and it will keep your wine at an ideal temperature throughout your meal. No ice, no fuss. Perfect"

No, now that i have my own Cuisinart DCG-20BKN Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder i can grind to my hearts content in the sanitary privacy of my own apartment. now i grind all the time, day and night. when my neighbor complains and bangs on the wall, i just keep grinding. i love my Cuisinart DCG-20BKN Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder! i just wish i liked coffee"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Perfect for two,"We bought this to replace another rotisserie that we had left when moving, we sought something that had a small footprint and did the job for us. I researched the available ones for sale and decided that this one would best suit our needs. From the day we got it, I have liked the ease of clean up, and the speed of cooking.  We don't need a huge one and we aren't planning on cooking two chickens at the same time.  This one does one great, and two cornish game hens at once. It comes with a nice basket for fish fillets and veggies.  Overall the machine is great, does what it is supposed to do and is easy to clean.  Not much else you could ask. My wife likes the fact that it sticks to the counter top and doesn't move around by bumping into it. We have a small kitchen.  "
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Almost perfect,"I've got this one and the 10 1/4"" skillet.  For a family of 5, this size is perfect.  It easily handles 3 lbs. of ground beef, a double batch of Hamburger Helper, or 8 small chicken breasts.  This is the pan I reach for most often.  However, it's not quite perfect.  I'm having a devil of a time getting pancakes to cook evenly.  Others have mentioned uneven heating due to it's size, and I've wondered the same thing.  If the only flaw in this pan is imperfect pancakes, I can easily live with it and find a more suitable pan for the pancakes.  This is my ""go to"" pan whenever I'm cooking for our crew; can't imagine cooking without it.  It browns & carmelizes beautifully. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,This is the best garlic press!,"After years of using garlic presses that just don't seem to measure up, I decided to spend a little extra money and get the KitchenAid press.  This was money well spent!  It's the best press I've ever owned and for once I feel like I am really getting the most out of my garlic!  And it's easy to clean too.  It's a little heavier than most, but that's okay with me - it does the job it's supposed to"

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,GREAT QUALITY!     * * * * *,"First of all, I can't believe these sheets only had 1 review before mine!  All I can say is WOW!  When I opened these sheets out of their package, they were soft (not like flannel soft, though).  I have never seen QUALITY like this before in a set of sheets!  I washed them in warm water twice, put fabric softener in the rinse cycle, put them in the dryer!  These sheets did not come out of the dryer looking perfect or pressed and when I put them on the bed, they were a bit wrinkly, so I was a bit disappointed about the wrinkles, but the feel and comfort of these sheets made up for the way they looked!  I did some ""thread-count research"" before I purchased these.  Most of the time the manufacturers tell you that their sheets have 400 or more thread-count when actually they are somewhere in the 200's.  Also, what they do is weave in shorter fibers to get their ""so-called count"" (which break down over time and do NOT last), instead of using the longer better quality fibers.  Then, they tout that their sheets have ""2-Ply"" or ""4-Ply"" which make consumers THINK they are getting better quality, which is actually just the opposite.  THESE SHEETS have ONE-PLY, which is of great quality, and you can really tell when you put them on your bed and sleep on them.  I'm no scientist, and I haven't examined these sheets under a microscope, but I suspect these sheets really do have 1,000 thread-count, or it's pretty close!  They are the best quality I have ever seen, and a great deal for the price.  I will be purchasing another set!  I think they will last much longer than the 400-thread count sheets at Wal-Mart!    "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,Quality Control Failure ?,"I just finished returning the replacement for this cooker from amazon. The first one did not work for anything other than white rice and the second one has an out of control touchpad that spontaneously starts beeping all of a sudden. Looks like Zojirushi maybe having some quality control issues, according to even the Amazon customer service. Only saving grace is the fact that Amazon has been very good about the return process"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love it!,"This is a great purchase. We use this toaster oven for roasting peppers, baking bread, cakes, fish and chicken dishes and, yes, for toasting bread.

kitchen & housewares,8 of 13,2.0,Not happy with product,"We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients.  We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work.  Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great Cookware,"I got this set after my husband and I decided to get rid of all our non-stick stuff that we got for our wedding six years ago (some people think it's totally toxic and others think it's really ok if you use it right-- we just decided better safe than sorry).  After much research we settled on the Farberware Millennium (recommended by Cook's Illustrated and other sources).  Amazon is the only place we could find this set.  It has  the most pieces and the ones you want.  We ordered a set from Cooking.com, but returned it when it didn't have a decent size saucepan.  I have been using this set for a couple of months now and couldn't be happier.  I was a little worried about the cleaning when going to stainless from non-stick, but it's been no problem.  Anything that sticks comes off with dishwashing soap, hot water, and baking soda"

They are a great product.  I use the silicone spray, every few months when I do a thourough cleaning.  They are a good product when used with a quality litter.  I re-use the containers, a few times, until they crack.  They aren't that expensive, comparing the cost to a cheap litter having to change it more frequently, and loosing it all at once.  I have done the comparison with the total costs, and it is a little cheaper & smells better.  I am pleased with this product, if only it emptyed itself........"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Good Value,"I was looking at another Henckels set for a couple of hundred bucks. I just could not justify spending that kind of money for steak knives. I saw these and figured I could return them if they were too cheap. For $50 they are a super value. They don't have the weight of more expensive knives, but they are well built. I like the serrated edge. Cuts through a steak with very little effort. Block is a quality piece of wood. I'm very pleased and glad I did not spend $150 more for steak knives"

Not too big, not too small, sturdy material, well made, easy cleaning, DOES NOT LEAK, and with proper care should be good for a long time. Price may seem a little steep for its size, but it is a good product and in the long run, cheap pans cost a lot more money. I believe I made a good purchase and I am quite satisfied with my choice"

I wasn't sure Good Grips could improve on the old model, but this one is better.  Since it arrived we have reached for the i-Series Peeler every time.  It is very comfortable to use.

I know this is the more expensive of the single-cup coffeemakers, but after looking at reviews, this is  the one that was praised by all owners.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,"Fast, Easy, Very Good Buy! Works Great!  Safety Features Not a Problem.","I bought this for my mother-in-law to use to make meals for her mother who is 90 years old and can no longer wear dentures.  It is amazing!  ""Grandmother"" can now eat regular foods just like us.  I've pureed everything from hotdogs, to vegetables, to meats, to french fries for her and she really enjoys the food!  I've also used it to make homemade whipped cream, cucumber veggie chips (for my dehydrator), banana nut bread, salads, coleslaw, and cheese dip for the rest of us.  It shreds a block of cheese in about 30 seconds.    The first time I tried to use the machine, it did not work and only by looking at the instructions again, did I realize it was because I had the bowl on backwards.  Once I put it on the correct way, it worked fine.  I'm happy about the safety features because I had to get stitches a few years ago after cutting my fingers on a handheld blender because I was tired and not paying attention.  I like knowing that the cuisinart will not start if I have assembled it incorrectly.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I haven't experienced a ""wait time"" to use the Cuisinart if I have assembled it incorrectly and have to reassemble it.  There is also no worrying about lining anything up correctly.   You just have to make sure you have the bowl on with the handle facing the push buttons because otherwise the push top cannot lock in.  This is very easy and within a few uses you will immediately recognize which way to assemble the cuisinart.   Like the other reviewers said, Keep it out on your kitchen counter and you will use it more often. Cleanup is pretty easy.   I've washed it in the dishwasher with no problems.  The 14 cup size is perfect for a family of 4 or more, and really even if you are only cooking for 2, this is still a great machine.  I like cooking extra food so I have leftovers for later.  Fast and Easy!   I'm very happy I decided to spend the money.  I highly recommend this product"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,"Dishes are beautiful, but chip very easily","I owned a set of these dishes for 4 years.  They were beautiful, and we always received compliments on them, but I definitely would not recommend them for daily use.  Most of the bowls chipped as did several of the plates"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,2.0,Relay failed,"The flexible programming of this unit initially worked well  timing my 13-amp espresso machine. But after about 3 months the internal relay became intermittent, so the timer would come on, but power to the expresso machine would drop out after a short time. Tapping the timer would turn it back on, suggesting the relay as the culprit. Now I'm looking for something more reliable"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,The Best Small Spatula--A Kitchen Essential,"This Le Creuset Small Spatula is so useful--in cooking, with small pans, and in scraping jars and bowls. The colors are bright and pretty. You can keep the whole set of different size spatulas in a matching Le Creuset Poterie right next to your cooktop. I like that I can remove the head of the spatula, put it in the top level of my dishwasher, and sanitize it, especially after I have used it to make something with raw eggs. Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,Less Work With Better Results,"I have only one complaint about this rolling pin: that it wasn't available thirty years ago!  The first use of this Kitchenaid Nonstick Rolling Pin proved its vast superiority to the more traditional pins I've used, and subsequent experiments with other pins confirmed it.  Its increased heaviness does more of the work for the cook, without being too heavy for delicate doughs. The increased circumference allows it to contact more of the food to be rolled.  The nonstick surface resists sticking nicely, and its handles are much easier to hold than either the ball-bearing type or the stationary ones.  In short, this pin allows the cook to get on with the job, and to do it better"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,"Not perfect, but still worth it.","After using the wine savers, I was eager to try the canisters.  They do tend to come unsealed for some reason.  However, when they hold (more often than not) they do a wonderful job, and have saved me a lot of food that would have otherwise gone to waste.  I have kept rice cakes in these things for weeks, and they were as crisp as the day I opened the package.  I kept store-bought cookies in one for close to two months - again, not a bit stale.  I have noticed that any particles that adhere to the rubber seal or the rim of the canister seem to affect the seal, so I always check that no crumbs have stuck to either.  The water trick suggested by another reviewer sounds helpful.  My only concern there would be that that might introduce moisture into the canister.  However, I am going to give it a try.  All in all, these canisters are good.  The seal does occasionally fail, but when it holds, it is wonderful.  I am on this page because I am thinking of adding another to my set (I already have six canisters and two rectangular marinaters/containers, but I would use more if I had them).  BTW, the marinater does a wonderful job, and I've never had a problem with the seal while marinating (shorter time in use, perhaps?).   ...and it really does work fast"

The Corningware box does not protect the set well enough for shipment with the insufficient Amazon packing.  My first shipment arrived in pieces. Replacement set also arrived broken! Amazon wouldn't or couldn't send me what I needed to make a complete set. Returned order. So, I am now searching for a set in the Orlando area"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Great Looking and Functional,"I recently purchased the 3 1/2 quart buffet casserole.  I was worried about the size, but found that this pot beats the capacity of my 9 x 13 rectangular pyrex baking dish by 1/2 quart...and it has an oven proof lid!  So, any casserole that fits into my pyrex, will also fit into my buffet casserole, which is a much prettier serving piece.  "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"My first ""real"" dishes",For my 2nd apartment I decided to get real dishes instead of the hodge-podge I had from dorms and thrift stores. I could not be happier w/these dishes. The price was reasonable and they are incredibly durable.  I really like the plum-it's a rich purple and it was easy to match it to other fiestaware.  I liked the color so much I got the mugs and 2 other kinds of bowls to match the dishes. It was a great deal and it will be easy to add to my kitchen set.

I needed something that fits in the mini-fridges for college and this... fits. I don't drink excessive amounts of water, but I do however want the water I do drink to be clean, so Brita does the job. As I understand it, all the filters have a ""problem"" with the charcoal, which is fixed by filtering water through it until it runs clear. Which is worth the effort. This model hasn't broken or leaked or given me any kind of problems (partially because I don't fill it up to the top) I think I've heard of."

I read up on the various makers and chose the Salton based on the great reviews.  The yogurt that I make is now as good as what I used to buy and is only a fraction of the cost.  Invest in a candy thermometer to make sure that your milk is the right temperature before you add your starter.  I have used both the packaged starter as well as store bought active culture yogurt (plain) and had great results with either.  Now I just save some of every batch to use as my next starter. "
kitchen & housewares,29 of 29,1.0,Doesn't even toast well!,I bought this this toaster oven a few weeks ago and am very disappointed.  It is impossible to even get a decent piece of toast out this thing.  You put in one or two slices of bread (never mind six!) and the bread comes out untoasted in spots and nearly black in other spots.  Just heating something up requires you to constantly turn the food to keep it from burning.

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Worth the money,"I've had this fryer for over eight months and am very pleased with it.  The temperature setting is easy to use, as is the timer, both safely accessible away from the heat and steam.  The window isn't all that useful, however, as it quickly steams up and forms an oily film over time, and periodically needs to be cleaned with lemon juice and a soft cloth (mainly for appearance sake).  And the metal sides do become hot, so moving it even a little while cooking isn't recommended.  The large teflon-coated resevoir removes easily for draining old oil.  Cleanup is easy: just pop the resevoir, basket and even the internal part of the lid into the dishwasher.  And the charcoal filter is easily replaceable after the recommended 80 uses or so.  I love it"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Best whisk ever!,"A dream come true for beating and airating. This is what I reach for instead of balloon whisks, which don't make contact with the bottoms of mixing bowl or pan. Because each of the individual &quot;legs&quot; moves and beats independently, it beats much faster than traditional balloon whisks. Very comfortable to use. I've recommended this and given away many as gifts to cooking friends"

It is saving him many dollars as he does not have to run to a coffee house for his morning cup.  His only complaint is that sometimes the ""steal a cup"" feature does not work.  When he removes the pot to ""steal a cup"" before it is through brewing, it drips coffee on the heating element.  Otherwise, he is very pleased with the product"

This was only hand-washed after every use.  Don't waste your money on it; you will pull it out to use it, and will not be able to when you need it [like when you have that big turkey sitting on the counter, and find the injector unusable].  The acrylic body needs to be redesigned and manufactured with another, more durable material, then it would be absolutely great"

kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,2.0,Poorly Designed Product,"I bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. The manual is not thorough, but it does tell you AFTER you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an AC adapter.  I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit. Also, the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. The sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off, but the units are far from user-friendly."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Great for kids!,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder, and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast, making sandwiches, putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel, etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife, I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids, you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey, they can make their own sandwiches to take to school"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,The best I have tried,"I have tried almost every type of desk lamp there is in my quest for a low glare solution. I moved from incandescent bulbs, with their yellow light, heat, and bulb glare to fluorescent desk lamps. The blue-green light, coupled with glare off my glossy journal pages never really left me fully satisfied. Optimum positioning, after many experiments, turned out to be just BEHIND me to prevent the bulb from reflecting off the page into my eyes. I tried halogens but, inspite of their superior colour-rendering, I was put off because of the heat and, you guessed it, glare. Finally, I have found the ""Bright as Day"" lamp. No, it is not as bright as a twin bulb desk fluorescent, but the quality of the light was quite, uh, illuminating! The lamp shade is large and, coupled with the lamp's height, drastically reduces the ""point-source"" glare associated with most direct task lighting. With the lamp positioned in front and to my left, glare is not totally eliminated, but it is astonishing how much it has been reduced in this lamp compared to my other, now retired, lamps. The dimmer is a welcome bonus. This is the best lamp I have ever had"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Breville 800CPXL is a star,This is an outstanding citrus press. It is powerful and gets the job done fast.

How could I choose one favorite?"

Highly recommended"

I too am planning to hand them down to my kids when i get old and unable to carry them around.  I got this huge oven down at the outlet mall for next to nothing(literally) because it had slight damage to it.  I don't think i would have bought it otherwise.  The oven is so heavy it is hard to clean in the sink.  It is a beautiful pot...but definitely an occaisonal use pot due to it's size"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great FAN!,"We live in Texas where it gets HOT during the Spring, Summer and Fall so we need good fans.  This fan is great for blowing away some of the hot air.  I love it but the only complaint I have is that it is hard to clean the fan because the body is screwed together and won't come apart easily to clean it.  Otherwise I think it is a great fan.  I also have an 18 inch one that I've had for 3 years and it is still working and has never had any problems except trying to clean it since it also does not come apart easily for cleaning.  I highly recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Wine opener,"Although I have extremely arthritic hands, I find this opener easy to operate.  The accessories (foil cutter, wax remover, etc.) are also useful, even though I forget to use them as I'm not use to having them.  I also like the fact that everything is contained in the same place/holder and the appearance is such that it can be left out on the bar"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,Lasted Less Than 5 Months ,"I purchased this blender to make smoothies. It worked great for about 5 months and then the plastic piece that connects the motorized base to the blender pitcher broke off during useage. I generally use this blender once a day 5 times a week for smoothies. After the reviews that I read on Amazon and Consumer Reports I had expected this item to last longer. I purchased the small appliance warranty from Amazon also, big mistake. The blender didn't even last long enough for it to go into effect. I have heard the Braun is impossible to deal with on repair issues and that the cost of shipping is around 20 - 30 dollars. For that price I will find another blender. This blender is great if you are looking for something to take up space on your coutertop, but if you are looking for something to use 4 or 5 times a week it probably wont last long. I noticed that most of the good reviews for this product are from people that just recently purchased it. I wonder how many of them would give it a 5 star review after the first year...my bet is very few. Too bad 0 stars is not an option"

My mom has a tea room also and I plan on ordering her one today!  Thanks Presto! "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,Awkward to use and hard to slice ,"The mandoline looks nice witht the stainless steel, however, it's not usable.  Unless you have large hands, the food holder is hard to grasp which made it unusable to me.  The horizontal placing of the food blade made it difficult to cut anything hard like carrots.  You would need to exert more pressure than using a knife.  I tried to use it several times thinking maybe I am not using it right.  After using it several times on different vegetables, I have concluded that it's easier to just use the knife.  The only thing that it can cut better than a knife are paper thin slices of cucumber.  Otherwise it would be safer and quicker to cut with a knife."
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Great cookware,"I recently bought a ceramic cooktop stove and none of my pans would work well because of the grooves in the bottom.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Good quality but Really Really Thin,"I bought this comforter because of all the other positive reviews I read on the site.  The good news: The comforter arrived very promptly, even with the free standard shipping option. The Cons: When I opened up the package, I was disappointed to see how light and thin the comforter was...definitely not something you can use to dive under the covers with on a cold winter's day.  It was thinner than a generic down comforter I bought at a local Bed Bath Beyond (which cost less)!  It just wasn't as thick and warm as I had hoped.  After putting the comforter into my duvet cover you can barely tell there was anything inside. So despite the good quality construction, I am disappointed"

It's true that you get what you pay for.  When I received this set (I purchased the one in blue) I was very pleased with the overall quality of each individual item.  I would recommend this for anyone that has ever bought those cheap plastic spatulas, the cheap metal cheese graters that are difficult to clean and always end up rusting and those cheap wire whisks that end up rusting also.  You will get more than your monies worth out of this set. "

I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the pitcher is.  Sea Mist is much more beautiful in person, and so is the pitcher.  It not only matches my other Fiestaware pieces, but is an item that I can use in any room of the house.  I can see it displayed on the mantle, in a bedroom, the bathroom, as well as the kitchen.  If only Fiestaware would continue Sea Mist....I could order all the sizes of the pitcher and have a really nice display"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,GREAT PRODUCT !,I ordered this for my salon for vacuuming hair up during the day. 
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Very, very sharp","The design of this peeler is excellent. It's easy to grip, and you can reverse or replace the blade. But what really counts is the blade is sharp! Razor sharp! It works so easily it doesn't feel as if you're actually cutting. It comes with a plastic shield for the blade. I suggest you keep it and use it when you store the peeler to preserve that marvelous edge."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,1.0,Purposeful misleading,"The product may be fine but the description and presentation that Amazon is creating is vastly WRONG. It does say cover and a featherbed COVERS your exsisting mattress. At multiple places within this products page it describes the filling. That is not a accidental misleading or ambigious wording. It is false and a lie. I was just going to let the 10$+ go as a write off. You know ""you win some you lose some"" type thing. But after my first compliant they emailed me a very nice form letter apologizing for their error and making sure to tell me since it was all their fault that this occured they would pay my shipping back to return it. Then I opened my GoldBox offers. Guess what was offered to me with the same false description? How sorry and sincere can they be of their mistake if instead of altering the description they choose to make it a featured product? I fully intended to click the ""yes this answered my compliant"" link and be done with it. 10$ isnt worth the hassle in most cases. But I am just so incensed that not even 24 hours after my complaint(and obviously others as these reviews show) they choose to try and take advantage of as many more people as they could. I just can not wait to see which form letter I get this time."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,The quick and simple approach to good coffee on demand...,"I bought this coffee maker for my husband a little over a year ago as a supplement to our Cuisinart Grind 'n Brew coffee bar.  Initially, I chose the Melitta One:One because of the simplicity.  My husband constantly neglected to clean the Cuisinart after brewing (a time-consuming chore with all the parts involved), which left him ""coffee-less"" on those hectic, running late mornings.  Tired of hearing him complain about the coffee he was ""forced"" to buy on those rushed mornings, I thought the Melitta One:One would be the perfect back-up plan.  "

If they had a frame to contain the shape, they'd be great. I used 2 to make a birthday layer cake of lobsided hearts, that did not match. It was good for a laugh and afterall, it is the thought that counts. The cake baked normally. The next time I try these, I'm going to try and fashion a coat hanger frame for stability.

The happy couple enjoys collecting and tasting wines so my friends and I gave them this and a wine journal as a congratulations gift. That was over a year ago. Last week, we all dined at their home and the husband got out the coaster to say how often they use it and how much they enjoy it. When I thought about it, I was even more impressed and flattered since they must have been given over one hundred wedding gifts and they actually remember that we gave them this coaster. I recommend this for your own home or as a unique housewarming or wedding gift"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"For use only by ""seasoned"" cooks.","I can understand how the last person rated this grill. I probably would have done the same had I not first attended a cooking class where the Calphalon One line was used. There are some tricks that are referred to, but not suitably emphasized in the documentation that comes with the cookware. Most practiced chefs are already aware that surfaces need to have a fine layer of oil and that the type of oil used is also important. The temperatures are critical. The fat content of the food also comes into play. After about two fine tunings (after which the pan can be scrubbed with a cleanser like Bar Keepers Friend unlike ""non-stick"" cookware), my pancakes easily lift off the pan with a metal spatula (which you are also allowed to use). The real bonus here is that they are evenly and nicely browned, unlike `non-stick"" cookware which tends to leave them done but with a pasty look."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Wonderful fiesta go along......,"I hesitated to use these mugs when I first received them.  Now I use them exclusively as our everyday mugs.  They are a nice heavy weight ceramic that helps keep our coffee warm, they do not chip and wear beautifully.   I and my husband do not have a problem with the size of the ring to hold our mug as the other reviewer did.  I would have given them five stars if they held more coffee as I prefer a big mug.   These are simple and elegant in their design as all the fiestaware pieces are.  You can't go wrong with these if you are a fiesta fan"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,Great way to brew and carry your coffee,"     This mug, which is an ingenious comination of a French press and an insulated mug, produces about 16 ounces of excellent coffee comparable in quality to my French press at home.  You can drink straight from the mug after brewing, but I prefer to pour the coffee into a separate cup.  The mug and press are very well made, should prove very durable and the mug has a neat little storage compartment in the base to store extra ground coffee for your next cup.  An excellent way to make one cup of coffee whether you are at home, the office or on the road"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,nice item,I bought this and thought it was decent. Don't forget 24oz is small. Its not a dish that can hold several portions. If you are looking to use it for one portion that is fine. One thing I need to point out is that the cover is plastic and plastic heating up in a microwave according to some may not be the best idea since plastic in a heated environment can give off toxins. Something some may want to keep in mind. Happy eating

I didn't think I'd find anything better than my Rubbermaid but I did. I love this spatula. The size is perfect too. It takes the heat"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Inexpensive, convenient","I've had one of these for about 10 years now, and it works fine.  I have to admit when I first bought it, I was a little taken aback at how flimsy it was.  However, as another reviewer pointed out, you're holding a few ounces of pasta, not a 10 pound roast.  As for those who say the dowels are too close together, you need to use your noodle (pun intended) and learn how to think a little.  I actually like how this one works.  Unlike other dryers, the dowels are easily removed from the rack.  I start with all the dowels out of the rack.  I pick up a dowel, and when the pasta from my extruder or roller is the right length, I just drape it over the dowel, cut it off the pasta machine, and repeat until the dowel is full.  Then I place it in the rack, pick up another dowel and repeat.  When the pasta is dry, I just hold the dowel over a pot of boiling water or a freezer bag, and slide the pasta off.  No big deal.  "

kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,2.0,Very Disappointed,"I bought the Simac MX700 PastaMatic Pasta Maker to replace my Cuisinart pasta maker.  My Cuisinart was a bull at making pasta.  It made 1-1/2 pounds at a time and was never a problem.  I do not feel the same way about the Simac.  Mine would overheat during extruding.  Also, it barely made enough pasta to feed my family of 4.  It finally died after 1-1/2 years of use.  When I say died I mean it started smoking and making very strange noises. Also, there is no way I was going to send it back to Italy for service. I have resigned myself to purchasing homemade pasta at the store. I wish I could find a better pasta machine.  What I really wish is that Cuisinart still made a pasta machine"

Well, at least these are serving a purpose, and are reusable....I don't have to scoop anymore, and I have 2 cats, I change it maybe every 3rd day, and it's not a chore, takes less than a minute, less time than scooping and smelling it as it sits there,  and speaking of, I do not smell their poop at all till it's changed. so I'm happy and I think it's more than worth it!"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,The last mixer you will ever buy,"I have owned my KitchenAid stand mixer for over 8 years and have had no problems with it whatsoever. This mixer is so great. I use whenever I can. It actually makes baking fun. Years ago I used to use my moms old Sunbeam mixer and whenever I tired to make a recipe that had a batter that was very thick it would slow the mixer down and sometimes it would stop on me. Not with the KitchenAid. I have had no slowdowns whatsoever. Even with the thickest dough and batters the KitchenAid never gives me any trouble. This is an appliance that you can leave on your countertop all the time because it looks great and you can pretty much get it in any color you want to match your kitchen. So, if you are in the market for a stand mixer and want to get your moneys worth then look no further. This is the mixer for you"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Poach me some eggs, woman!","This thing works great!  Just the ticket for some nice poached eggs.  It helps to have a nice big pan with a lid to cover the whole getup, otherwise you need to turn the eggs to really get them to cook, at least up here in the mountains.  But for what it is, namely a piece of steel covered in teflon with four egg-sized depressions stamped in it, it's pretty durn good"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Thick and Soft towels,"I got the Supima bath and face towels (Buttercup color).  They have gone into the washer and dryer, and have held up well without falling apart!  As some other reviewers have noted - they are thick, soft and absorbant - therefore, they don't feel wet after they have been used.  Sometimes I have problem trying to figure out which one my husband just used for his shower.  The only minor casualty we've had was my husband put one of the face towels into the wash with other soiled laundry using the HOT water/Superwash cycle and might have bleached the color off somewhat.  I usually use the WARM or COLD wate/Normal cycle and do not have the problem"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,great set,So far I am very happy with the Cuisinart Chef's set.  I was apprehensive because I was afraid I would have a lot of problems with food sticking to the pans.  That hasn't happened and even when I scorched some rice it cleaned up quickly and easily.  They look beautiful and I do put them through the dishwasher.  The handles stay cool and I love the fact that I can put them into the oven. I've had them for 3 weeks but have found no negatives yet.  I have found that I need to purchase a 12 quart stock pot for larger crowds
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,5.0,Not for the weak,"This is a machine which requires &quot;touch&quot;.  Also a burr grinder.  If you are interested in respecting the tradition of great barristas, you're on the right track.  Grind, measurement, and compaction are your first hurdles towards perfect crema. Your next obstacle is milk.  The capp siphon attachment works quite well, but the milk needs to be preheated for perfect temperature.  Steaming one cup's worth of milk with the wand is a bit of a challenge as it scalds quickly.  All in all this machine is very satisfying to those willing to deal with a leaarning curve.

They slice quickly into whatever width you want, from slivers to less thin pieces, with only a modicum of practice.  The sharp flat cutting edge, safely lower than the handle, makes for an easy, comfortable grip.  These knives have multiple uses--not just slicing for Asian-style food, nor, for that matter, just for thin slicing.  One can chop, dice, or slice safely and quickly with these finely made instruments.  I have a large collection of Wusthof knives, but this style is one of my favorites and most frequently used"

My only disappointment is that they come just shy of holding an entire standard can of soup.  If you do not remove about four tablespoons worth of soup before cooking in the microwave, the soup will spill.

We recieved our first one within days from amazon.  Unfortunately the heat source broke in transit.  Amazon replaced it so quickly and easily, I swear we had the next one within 2 days.  This toaster is a convection oven so the air circulates and truly cooks everything perfect in much less time.  Best of all, NO PREHEATING.  Since this toaster which we love (and have encouraged everyone we know to buy it) we have bought a full size oven with most of the same features.  It is very worth the money and is even attractive.  I have cooked full chicken dinners, biscuits, cookies, muffins, toast of coarse, bacon, etc. and I am thoroughly enjoying this product"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 11,1.0,"Good blender until it breaks, and warranty = zero","I was very happy, until this blender broke.   Was very careful with it, but after only 5 weeks, it was done.  Called the ""hassle free replacement warranty customer satisfaction center""  and they said they would ship out a new one.  Great!    "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Great one. Available much cheaper at other online stores.,Great spatula. Works well for fish and for pancakes and omlettes too. You can get it much cheaper at other websites and in speciality food stores
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,2.0,Clever but...,"...the darn thing had to be replaced twice in 6 months because it cracked on the bottom, dead center, and the milk I was measuring leaked out."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Product is fantastic,"I ordered two fans, the shipping was prompt. Both arrived in assembled and in good condition. I was able to instantly plug them in and be relieved from the scorching heat. The clip-on is very useful. At home, I can clip the fan such that my 1 year old daughter cannot reach it. Overall, a great purchase. Hats off."
kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,5.0,"Nice Set, BUT....","I had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well. Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned, I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered. I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans. I decided to keep them but am quite upset, with my only alternative being to return them for credit."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,SET IT & FORGET IT,"I got this as a gift for my parents a few years ago and they really love it. They use it often to make chicken, and roasts. Even though it is over 4 years old it still works very good. This is a great item to give as a gift because you can be certain that your recipient will enjoy it and use it for years to come"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,No Frills & No Satisfaction,"This is a basic coffee maker.  Unfortunately, you really must use the mesh filter that comes with the appliance.  Using paper cone filters for more than 4 cups of coffee will lead to clogging in the water drip container and cause the water to overflow and make a mess.  If cheap is what you want in a coffee maker then, this is it.  You definitely get what you pay for with this product."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Worth every penny of it,"Have three cats and been searching for a small, efficient vacuum, cordless that really worked. No longer do I have to drag out the big vacuum and have the hassle of the cord and not be able to get in the small areas due to the bulkiness. The Shark is lightweight, powerful enough to vacuum up the debris, gets into corners, can be used on bare floors and carpets. Cat hair is a bit more complicated, requiring a brushing motion, but it really gets it off the furniture and cat bedding.It is super easy to clean and wish I'd known about it sooner."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,great price. . .great wafflemaker,"I wanted a good wafflemaker for a good price and this excells in both.  I've been using this for about 3 months with excellent results.   No bells or whistles for this price, but great waffles.  Heats/ cooks evenly, rugged nonstick surface, easy cleanup inside and out.  Hard plastic shell gets hot too, but not enough to give you a burn unless you decide to keep touching it"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,GREAT Platter!,"Don't laugh but I use this thing year round.   It's the perfect size for sweet corn in the summer and it's also a little refreshing to look at in 90 degree heat!  That aside, mine gets used continuously and it still looks great.  I load it up with everything you can imagine and the presentation is so beautiful on this platter.  I've had mine for 12 years now and it still looks new.  Amazon's $20 pricetag is just awesome too! I paid more than that at an outlet"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Sango Spash Baking Bowl Set,Its the first time I've ever had a set of dishes that I could expand upon.  This one is fantastic.  I loved the bowls because they are deep rather than wide and look great
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Presto 06852 16"" Electric Skillet with Glass Cover","This Electric Skillet is one of the better ones that I have ever owned.  It is very solid looking with its square body, rounded legs and glass cover.  It cooks everything quite evenly.  Even if you are not cooking for a ""Cast of Many"" it still works very well.  It is quite large to store, but if you don't mind storing it in your ""oven"",like I do, it is the greatest"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Hot water in a flash,"I have used a Hot Shot for many years and wouldn't be without one.  Now, I give them to other people for gifts and I get nice remarks about them.  Much quicker and safer than using the microwave to make a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.  Also useful for making instant oatmeal or instant grits"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Mini souffle cups,These are the cutest little oven-proof souffle cups you've ever seen and a huge hit at a recent party.  They really do make perfect mini-souffles
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Everyday Dishes,I love these! They are so cute and super durable. Very good quality
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great gift for the coffee/loose tea lover on your list!,"I've purchased a total of 5 of these mugs now (different colors). They're well-constructed and attractive. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. I've put 3 aside for Christmas gift giving. I think they're uniquely perfect for that person who seems to have everything, without spending a fortune to achieve that ""Wow!"" factor. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Good stuff,Kitchen Aid never lets me down.  I bought this to use when cooking on the foreman grill.  It is perfect
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,2.0,Cheap but there are Better,"I bought this product because it's the least expensive model sold here in Amazon.  I figured how bad could a relatively simple device with a singular function be?  While the unit does grind coffee, it is relatively loud, messy, and takes longer.  "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,4.0,Good Buy,Tested several torches in the store and found this one to be the best.  Once I got it home it was fun learning how to use to on real deserts.  Happy I picked this one
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,saucy little pitchers,"I have two of these and use them for sauces or dressings that pour easily.  Thick or chunky items don't always pour so well, but cream, herbed olive oil, au jus, etc. work well.  These are good for meals where a sauceboat is too big or where you'd like to have more sauce containers readily available to your guests rather than waiting for the gravy boat to get passed around and around so often"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A CLEAVER THAT'S WORTH  IT'S METAL !!,Of all of the Henkels I own this cleaver seems to get used the most of all !! It holds a sharp edge longer than any other Henkle Iv'e owned and it's a Great size shape and wieght !!
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,mine is west bend 40073 model,"I got my timer at local walmart store, the model is west bend 40073. I absolutely love it. It's  very self-explanatory and easy to use. it has a clock, count down or count up timer, and there are three channels that allow you to set three different times with each channel having a distinct sound. I have a Sunbeam timer, which is not good , nothing compared to this one. I carry it around with me all the time, it definitely has more use than a kitchen timer"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,4.0,A good looking canister set...with a great price!,"If you are in search of a canister set that is stainless steel, and has a sealed lid?  Then this is the canister set for you!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Works great for me,"I think this product is very well designed, it's simple and it works.  On some of my cheaper teas ""not all the leaves are whole"" I was frustrated at how the little slits did get clogged with tea leaves.  But I found that it was easy enough to clean with a business card, by running it through the slits. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,All-Clad - Expensive but Terrific,"WHen All-Clad first introduced their line of bakeware, I wondered who would be reckless enough to spend $79 on ONE 9"" cake pan or a similarly outrageous amount for an 8""square pan, rectangular pan, etc."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,GREAT set for the price,I purchased this knife set in Nov. 2005. I knew that for the price I was not getting the German Henckels so I went in with my eyes open unlike other reviewers. I just needed a good set of affordable knives.
kitchen & housewares,3 of 6,4.0,so far so good,I have only used it a few times but so far so good
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Best Espresso ever,"I bought this after reading many reviews and I am glad that I did, the quality of this Espresso is EXCELLENT, I am almost addicted to it now because it is so good, I constantly want to have another, I also bought the Starbucks Espresso Pods, which I would not recommend, they have a bland taste, but I would recommend the Illy pods to anyone, in fact, I am back for my second purchase"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,A Terrible Product,"I made two attempts to get this machine to work and both times it had problems.  After the unit runs for about 8 minutes, the unit starts shaking and making loud noises.  It shakes so hard it could literally fall off of the counter. The center section  that connects the lid to the cannister stops turning and therefore it deals with major resistance and makes horribly loud sounds.  If you remove the lid the sounds stop but this machine is not meant to run without its lid.  Left uncovered, the ice would melt quickly and the mixture would be exposed.  I called Euro-Pro and the representative said I should be using crushed ice instead of square ice cubes (which the owner's manual recommends.) When I told her I'd have to use my blender to make crushed ice, she said I could just wrap some ice in a kitchen towel and break it up with a hammer.  She was certain the unit would work with crushed ice even though the manual does not make such recommendation.  You'd probably need to come up with about 4 cups of crushed ice to fill the canister.  I told her I don't have time to make crushed ice; I just want to fill the unit and have it work.  I am returning it to Costco.  Don't waste your time and money on this machine. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Great for Applesauce but not for rasberries,"I tried this for rasberries and it left too much of the berry stuff among the seeds, so foolishly I ran it through again. That cracked the strainer. I'm still using it (cracked and all) for applesauce, going on 15 years, and its still the cat's pajamas. Everyfall it gets loaned out to my friends who don't own a mixer. (Otherwise I'd buy them this strainer pack)."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,OK-But Sometimes do not stack well,"The dispensers hold cans and dispense them well but sometimes do not stack well.  When they are full the cans roll out nicely and the weight keeps dispensers stacked well.  However, when not full the tabs of the upper dispenser can slip off the slots on the lower one"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect Machine,"I was very skeptical about buying an all-in-one machine.  I had heard all of the negative things about them but, this has been a spectacular machine.  It brews great coffee.  It's very easy to use.  And, it cleans very easily as well.  I love being able to put fresh beans in before bed, set the timer, then wake up to fresh brewed coffee"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent Buy - Wife is very Happy,"Prompt and faster than expected delivery through free shipping. Looks exactly the same as in the picture. Looks & feels expensive, quite warm and cozy comforter set. It has a slightly different shade of gold."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Meets my needs for pet stains,"I bought this to take care of pet-related issues.  I have 3 dogs.  As any pet owner knows, sometimes they get sick, or they have an accident.  This cleaner works great to remove the mess and the stain.  I use it with Bissell or Hoover cleaning products.  It really works great.  Yes, it takes a little while to dry the carpet out, but I would say that it dries out in about 2 to 3 hours.  I am not using the cleaner for large areas, just small stained areas."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Smoothie Maker,This blender performs better than I imagined.  It mixes all ingredients without stopping and using a spatula.  Just select the correct speed and you're good-to-go.  It also seems to be constructed very well. The dispenser works great to.  The unit is heavy enough so you don't push the blender over when using the dispenser
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,5.0,Beautiful and colorful! Definately worth the purchase!,"I have owned this stoneware for several years. The oversized plates allow for plenty of room for dinner, without removing any of the beauty of the plate. The rims are raised a little, but every so often in the pattern, one of the fruit dips down onto the plate or bowl.  There are many accessories available too, all as nicely done"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,bad stuff,"Just as other reviewers said, this quality is really bad. DO not buy this"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Unbelievable value and quality!,"I had purchased a lower end vacuum sealing kit from another manufacturer about 3 years ago.  I ended up hating to use it because it was difficult to use, was extremely noisy, and took two people to use the device."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great help with Kitchen Aid mixer!,The extra long rubber portion of this spatula works very well to scrape down the sides of the bowl as it flexes along the curve of the bowl and reaches the bottom easily
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great Product!,Works like a champ; very solid and amazingly easy to clean up since there are no removable parts except the lid. I love that!  Mix up the goods - and rinse it out right after. Very powerful MOTOR. I need to learn how to chop ice better - I was hoping this thing would just finely chop ice cubes into a tasty margarita goodness - but I still have to work hard to get the ice down into the blades.. 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,2.0,Lefties unite!,"It looks nice, but too bad it won't work for me.  I'd buy the left-handed version, though.  :-"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,beautiful,"These mugs are the favorite of my wife.  They are heavy, a testiment to their durability.  The cobalt blue on the outside and the french white on the inside it absolutely beatiful"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Order Extra Hooks for Your Rack!,"The Calphalon Spacesaver Pot Rack Hooks (set of two) are very handy to use in organizing your Calphalon half round or hanging pot racks. I like to use these hooks for nestling two omelet/frying pans together, since I have Calphalon anodized aluminum ones in 7-inch, 8-inch, 10-inch, 12-inch, and 14-inch sizes. However, I hang my Calphalon Commercial nonstick  omelet/frying pans on the double pot hooks, back-to-back, as I like to be more careful with the insides of these pans"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,1 Qt saucepan,This is a great pot for cooking sauces and such for 1-2 people.
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Works great! No problem getting dark toast,"I really hesitated to order this toaster because of complaints about it not toasting items completely enough (because, depending on what I am toasting and why, I sometimes like my toast dark).  I bought it anyway because of the bagel function, and figured I would just ""double toast"" if necessary.  I have absolutely no complaints about this toaster!  If I turn the darkness knob all the way to the darkest setting, I get toast that is quite dark -- what I would call burnt, actually; more importantly, I no longer have to choose between bagels that are not toasted enough (but still soft inside) or toasted as I like them on the outside and dried out inside.   The bagel function on this toaster works great -- fully toasted on the cut side and completely warmed throughout without being dried out!  This is how a bagel SHOULD be toasted.  I don't know if the company has modified the unit, or if others just got ""unlucky"" or if I just got ""lucky"", but this toaster works fine for me at whatever setting I use with just a sngle toasting."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"I love 'em , Totally Great ",I exspecially like the little strainer thingie that comes with it. These are very durable and really helped with my holiday cooking greatly! Really the above person said about the best you can get is RIGHT ON the Money! Enjoy and recommend. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Corelle white 16-piece set,"The dishes arrived quickly and wellpacked (there was no breakage, etc."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great Little Machine,"I have two espresso makers.  One very expensive in the kitchen and this little Krups in our coffee bar.  This is the second little Krups I've owned.  The first just died after 5 years of use so for the price it's worth every penny.  I use this little one every day and without fail it makes the best latte and steams the perfect chi tea!  If you entertain a lot and want to make more than two drinks, this is not the machine for you but if you just make one or two per day then you can't go wrong.  The trick to this machine is to turn the steam nozzel on first and let the water run until it starts to steam, then you can start making your espresso.  It makes much better froth this way.  Also, the first time you use this machine you will find that the espresso basket overflows so don't pack coffee too tight the first time.  Even though the instructions indicates you should not to pack the coffee, it've always packed it and it never fails me.  If it starts to overflow it usually means you need to descale and you'll be fine again.  Great little machine!  "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Cuisipro Accutec Dual Grater,"I love this microplaner. The fine grater makes the lightest, thinnest shred of fruit peel I have ever seen. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the rounded rubber tip makes it less stable when pressing against my cutting board. I wish they would have made the edge square instead of rounded"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 8,2.0,would have appreciated a box in better condition,"Having bought this item for a friends wedding gift, I was a bit upset when the package arrived and upon inspection found that the box was actually torn. This looks like I purchased the silverware at a yard sale or bargain bin. The only positive thing was that it arrived on time"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 89,5.0,A question,"How come people think kitchen basters, and especially the large-sized turkey basters are so funny? What's the joke? Am I missing something here"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Tilia V2440 Advanced Design FoodSaver Home Vacuum-Packaging System,"I have a model with the ""canister"" feature. I would say that items in canisters don't keep quite as long as advertised, but are a big improvement over other storage methods.  Overall, I am very satisfied so far"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Good product in general,"I've owned this crock pot for several years.  It performs consistently well, and I've cooked everything from beef BBQ to chili to caramel for cream pies.  My only gripe is that once while cooking I noticed quite a lot of hot water sputtering out from around the lid.  With two kids in the house, I didn't like the possibility of burns, so I put a dishtowel on top of the whole thing to contain the sputtering hot water.  The steam and heat trapped by the dishtowel actually warped the plastic handle on top of the lid.  Next time I'm in the market for one of these products, I'll look for something a bit sturdier"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,gorgeous and unique,"highly recommended, i fell in love with them at first sight. very classy... the only downfall is on all of them u can see the glue at the bottom of the flute upon close inspection. But i bought them anyway and would not give them up"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,The Best Sleep Ever!,"I bought the Queen size Premier Raised Aerobad a few months ago and since I began using this bed, I have gotten the best sleep I have ever had!!  This bed is extremely comfortable.  It provides great support.  I never have problems with pressure points or waking up sore and stiff the way I did with a regular bed.  It uses standard bedding, which is very convenient.  It appears to be very durable.  I've only had mine a relatively short time, but my son has had one for a while longer and his is holding up great.  For anyone who wants to try an airbed, I'd say you've got to go with the AeroBed brand.  Before I bought this bed I had tried an airbed of another brand and it was nothing like the Aerobed.  I love this bed and would never go back to a regular bed or even a waterbed after experience the comfort of the AeroBed"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Rich Looking Bookcase,"I have been very happy with this bookcase. It has a rich look to it even though it is comparably inexpensive. I love the color of wood and the easy setup. My only complaint is that when I first set it up, it didn't line up as perfectly as I wanted it to. But  overall it looks great and I have been happy with it"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,AIRBAKE the way to go!!," have had my two sheets for about 15 years or more. Before buying these I was buying cookie sheets every couple years. These still look good. I have never put them in the dishwasher. They wash quick and easy clean up. If something is stuck on it I just wet a sponge and let it sit on it for a bit and then wipe it up. I have NEVER had a problem with uneven cooking or burning. I have even used the one with the sides all around for pork chops, etc. I love my AIRBAKES!!"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,1.0,Cheap Painted Pan,"When this pan showed up, I loved it. It looks cool and it cooks well. But the finish wore off within a couple of months, and I was left with an ugly aluminum pan. I called Calphalon but they told me that if I didn't follow the cleaning instructions they wouldn't replace it. But the instructions are to wash it before AND after you cook."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,My carpets are clean!,"I used the Hoover Deep Cleansing Carpet/Upholstery Detergent in my new Hoover steam cleaner. I had previously rented cleaners from Lowe's and Giant and bought whatever detergent went with the machine. My carpets were always pretty clean after using the rented units, but my new Hoover and this detergent definitely got them cleaner. The spots that had been in the carpet for years even came out. It also got out the pet odor from the two dogs in the house without creating a wet dog smell while the carpet was damp, as the rented unit and detergent had done"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellant Buy,"These are great sheets,very soft,thick,and comfy, I've washed them 4 or 5 times now and they still very smoot"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Beautiful, impressive for show","Just as pretty as the pic, if not more so.  I ordered more because they are great in the guest bathroom.  The color is yummy, (buttery) and the design is quality made.  I wish they came in more colors, I would buy more. A great deal for the price.  They feel good, like luxury towels. are absorbant, but not really too thick, which works considering the design. Oh, and they don't have the polyester slick feel, they feel like good cotton, so pretty and functional. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,All-Clad 6-Piece Stainless Steel Tool Set - Superb,"These are the best utensils.  The tools and the crock are excellent quality 18/10 stainless steel, and very easy to clean.  The polished stainless is so gorgeous you can definitely use them to serve as well.  The handles match the handles of the All Clad cookware line.  They are an excellent design and quality that will last a lifetime.  An All Clad must have! Highly recommended! A"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Works great!,I like that it has the 3 sizes and that it is high quality stainless steel vs. plastic. It cleans easily and of course is dishwasher safe. I think it is a good value

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,Inexpensive K-Cup Alternative,"The Keurig 5048 My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter is a relatively inexpensive K-Cup alternative and works as it is supposed to. If you only want one cup of coffee, you only have to clean out the filter once. But if you want to make individual cups for several people, you must clean out the filter between each brew. For those days when you have guests, I recommend the prepackaged K-cups"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,nice size & heft,I have the 10 & 12 inch millenium and like them both. The 8 inch is a good size for a single serving or to saute mushrooms. The sides are higher than I expected which is great. The skillet doesn't feel flimsy at all. I don't put any of these nonstick skillets in the dishwasher. They don't need more than a quick swipe with a regular sponge to clean up
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Kitchenaid Silicone is GREAT,"The silicone spoons, spatulas, and bowl scrapers are the best.  Quality all the way.  I highly recommend these as they will last a long time"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Wow!!,"I love this silverware! I've bought three sets of the Non-Stop version and EVERYBODY always comments on it. I love the modern look that this has.  I searched everywhere for a set that matched my style ( I didn't want something that looked like it belonged at my grandmother's house)and finally found it here at Target. The reason i'm writing this review now is because of the customer service at the Gourmet Settings company (where this sliverware is from).  I had a couple rust spots on a few knives and forks and emailed the company about this problem.  Two days later (today) I recieved the replacement set via UPS.  I am soo impressed with this company! Seriously you could not ask for prettier, modern sliverware or the wonderful and helpful customer service that this company brings"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Love it!  Easy to Clean...good customer service,I have a few pieces of Emile Henry and look forward to getting more.  They clean up so much easier than Pyrex ever has for me.  They look brand new all the time!  And the colors are fabulous.  I had a piece break in half while roasting veggies.  I called Emile Henry and they had me ship it to them at not charge to me.  They inspected it and replaced it for me at no charge at all!  Because of the customer service I will continue to purchase Emile Henry
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Most useful utensil in the kitchen!,"I got this to replace the ""as seen on tv"" wisk/spatula--which doesn't even compare.  Do yourself a favor and get this item--I know you will love it.  I use it for everything.  (Scrambled eggs, French toast, fish, hard boiled eggs, steamed vegtables etc.) It's great on nonstick surfaces too. It saves time and space. You will be able to see and feel the quality as soon as you hold it in your hand.  It's sturdy and it looks great.  I am getting one for all my relatives for Christmas"

I don't know if it's the rain or heat (neither is suppose to bother it), but after a couple of months, it simply quits sensing the barking. It gets to the point that you have to hit the sensor hole directly to get it to even trigger. In addition, the label starts to shrivel up.. a sign that it can't really handle the weather. I've sent 7 of these back.. now Smarthome is smart enough to not even carry them. Stay away from this dog"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Awesome!,This product is wonderful.  You can cook different things at the same time on it and everything is done in minutes.  I love this grill.  Anything that can save me time in the kithen is a friend of mine.
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,2.0,Avoid It If You Can,"This comforter set is a big disappointment. It looks much better in photo than in real. The thread-count of the comforter is very low and it feels like rough plastic. The 180-thread-count kid's comforter I had feels a lot softer and smoother than this. Also, the King size comforter is SMALL. This list price is a joke. Do not recommend, not even for the guest bedroom"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,4.0,bake evenly and last for years,"I, too, was surprised by the negative reviews for these cookie sheets.  My mom has had a set of these pans for years and years and were the only ones I've ever baked with until recently, when I had the misfortune to bake cookies with several other types of cookie sheets, many of which resulted in over browned cookie bottoms.  My boyfriend's mother uses these cookie sheets too and I plan to order a set of my own now.  Just as a note to potential buyers, these are not no-stick sheets- you probably will have to grease them (not with butter which burns, don't do as one of the other reviewers...).  It's up in the air right now as to whether or not the material on no-stick cookware (and hairdryers, toasters, etc) has negative effects on human health.  Using items with no-stick surfaces kills birds, so it seems likely it's not that good for people.  A little off topic, but just putting that out there"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,awesome power!,"I never knew how easy it could be to cut brownies, pizza, whatever as I have found with this beauty.  My wife won't go near it because she is afraid of it.  It is extremely sharp and would not be good to keep around with kids. It has a sheath and you will want to use it to protect the blade. I can't believe I'm talking about the edge of a pizza cutter, but this thing is just like one of my Henckels in quality.  You won't get an argument from any pizza. It will cut through it like warm butter. This is a welcome addition to my arsenal of gadgets"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Serious Pizza Cutting tool,"It's rare that a tool feels this good in your hand.  Someone at KitchenAid put a lot of love into this design.  They really sweated the details.  The handle is ergonomic.  The hilt is functional and beautiful.  The plastic blade guard works well, and is a nice touch."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Eat with the family!,"This double-burner griddle is just what I was looking for.  The aluminum disk bottom encapsulated in stainless steel makes for easy cleaning and even heat distribution.  There are no hot spots or cold spots!  The coating is so nice, easy to clean, and you don't have to grease it before using it!  I can finally sit down and eat a hot breakfast with my big family!  I couldn't have asked for any better!  And the price is right"

kitchen & housewares,5 of 7,2.0,Black & Heck...this can opener sucks!,"I bought this and immediately had problems with it. I thought I was getting a good deal, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. It was not catching to open the cans, then it peeled and shredded the paper around the top, and then when it was scraping the top of the can (because it wasn't opening it) it was filing off tiny bits of metal. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to feed that to anybody. Not even my con-artist sister-in-law. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I called Black & Decker and they are replacing it for free. And when I told them that I just bought it they offered to pay for shipping as well"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,2.0,"Nice design, flawed execution.","I anxiously awaited this mug, which was backordered for about 2 months after I ordered it. It fits in my car's cupholder, which was my primary reason for ordering it, and it is stainless steel, which resists stains and odors much better than my plastic coffee mugs. However, the handle attachment is weak, and looks like it would be impossible to repair (though I did not test this). Worse, however, was the top, which leaked coffee all over me every time I drank from it. It didn't matter how tight it was. This was surprising because they designed it with an o-ring in the lid that should have prevented any leakage.  "

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,"Other than a burr grinder, this is probably the best one","Burr grinders give you less heat and more even grinding, but for the money, you can't beat the Krups Fast-Touch. The oval shape is supposed to distribute the heat and give a better grind. It's also large enough to accommodate beans for a 10 cup pot. Some other grinders I've seen have trouble handling enough coffee. Fresh ground coffee tastes better, and this is a reasonably good device for grinding the beans"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,adore this opener!,"I just adore this wine opener. I have gone through one refill already and am on my 2nd. That equals something like 200 bottles of wine or who knows how many. It's a great opener. I never touch the other openers any more, and I have many. I was highly skeptical at first (will it be too noisy, too gimmicky? will the gas change the wine in some way?), but it is just so easy to use and you get a perfect opening every time. No cork problems. I love this thing. It also works well on the synthetic corks, though you have to push pretty hard to get the needle through those things"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Cast iron works great,We have had this skillet for a few weeks now and it has performed very well right out of the box. No seasoning required. Fried eggs and omelettes cook great and don't stick to the pan.  Cleanup is easier  than our old non-stick or stainless pans.  Oiling the skillet for storage is pretty quick so it hasn't been a drawback.  The price was low enough to give cast iron a try and we don't regret it
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,1.0,Problem with Fast Cycle and Whole Wheat Bread,I make primarily whole wheat bread and the Toastmaster has separate cycles for fast and whole wheat.  Apparently the full cycle is the only option for whole wheat at 3 hours and 40 minutes.  The breadmaker that I am currently using allows for the use of the fast cycle with whole wheat (2 hours) which is much more convenient

kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Very impressed!,"I spent several weeks researching blenders.  Even the top rated Braun has reviews that aren't that great when it comes to crushing ice, which is what I was looking for.  This thing completely pulverizes ice to a smooth, soft, slushie consistency.  I was looking to recreate a certain frozen drink that I get at a restaurant, and the one we made with the Oster was even better than the restaurant's!  And they use one of those expensive frozen drink machines!  It's loud, but it works like a breeze.  The only thing I noticed is that it's so powerful, you need to put a towel over the lid because it will splatter out a little through the middle cap.  A small price to pay for the power this Oster has!  All the extras it comes with are a great bonus too"
kitchen & housewares,31 of 31,5.0,sturdy and beautiful,"The picture doesn't quite do the coloring justice. The bottom of the pitcher is much darker than the top, ranging from a deep brown/red to a beatifully vivid fire-engine red at the top. The size is just right for sangria for four or a dozen dahlias. As a pitcher, the handle is large and comfortable,and the spout is well-designed and prevents those irritating drips that happen with shorter spouts. As a vase, it'll win you a zillion compliments. My cats have managed to knock it over a couple times, even though it's quite heavy, and there's not a chip to be seen. (This says more about the determination of the cats than about the weight or balance of the pitcher."

kitchen & housewares,0 of 3,5.0,Wonderful manual juicer,"We love having fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice in the mornings.  This juicer is very easy to use (my two year old likes to put the oranges in and pull the handle), and a snap to clean.  This was a good investment for us"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,Still waiting to give this a try,"I am still waiting to use this pizza cutter.  Why am I writing a review now?  Because I want you to know how poorly this is packaged.  There is a round sticker around the entire blade, and it does not come off easily.  The blade does come out of the handle for cleaning.  That has not helped me to get this sticker off.  They must have used the strongest glue they could find to attach the sticker.  The sticker does not peal off.  Instead it tears, and comes off in tiny bits.  I picked at it for over half an hour.  I gave up for a while, and put the blade in the dishwasher.  I hoped the hot water and steam would loosen the label.  It did not. There is still glue and bits of paper that I am still picking off.  Although the blade is not 'razor sharp', I have to work carefully so I don't cut myself.  So far this product has been a big disappointment.  If I can ever get it clean enough to use, I'll write another review"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Large size Made in Indonesia ,"I couldn't resist getting just one of these bowls.  It is just as pretty as I imagined.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love it!,"I won't use any other whisk since I purchased my Ball Whisk from WMF.  I love the way it gets into the corners of a pan when I make candy, sauces or gravy.  It beats the eggs for scrambling fast and easy and is a dream to clean."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love this blanket,This blanket is soft and warm without bulk. It washes well and is larger than most blankets (making it perfect for sharing with the spouse). All in all a great buy
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,No More Grated Fingertips,"I use this for grating parmesan cheese, nutmeg, and ginger.  It does a great job on these.  It doesn't take much effort, and you get a nice fluffy pile of small flakes.  I'm sure it would work well for chocolate, too.  But the real benefit of this thing is that, strange as it sounds, it doesn't have any sharp edges on the cutting surface, so your fingers are safe even when you're grating the last teeny bit of nutmeg or cheese.  I've never used the highly touted Microplane brand equivalent, but my understanding is that it is very sharp and so, I suspect, not as safe in use or when you are rummaging for it in a drawer.  A few minor nitpicks:  1) The cleanup is not completely effortless, since food can get caught in the very tiny cutting channels, but 4 or 5 swipes of the ScotchBrite pad usually do the trick.  And of course you can use your fingers freely to help any remaining bits of food out.  2) It might benefit from a rubber bumper on the top edge so that it would grip the surface of a plate or countertop.  If you're really going at it with a block of parmesan, it's nice to rest that top edge against something for support, and as it is, the grater can slip around a little when you do that. 3)  It's not so good on mozarella, but I don't think any single grating surface can handle both soft and hard foods equally well. 4)   And as long as we're talking about single surfaces, I'm a little bit puzzled about whether the back of this is supposed to give a different result than the front--the difference is not very dramatic if it is.  But all in all I'm very happy to have this, and I pride myself on running a ruthlessly minimalistic kitchen when it comes to gadgets.  If something isn't earning its drawer space, out it goes.  This one makes the cut"

kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Well worth it!,"As you've probably read elsewhere, the Microplane grater was born when a cook discovered how good a carpentry rasp was for zesting.  It is indeed a superior tool, well worth the premium price, both in usefulness and in durability (someone I know who cooks all the time is still on her original one, which does NOT have the bells and whistles this one does!)  In particular, I now prefer it to my garlic press as it is quick, thorough, and easy to clean.  The &quot;pusher attachment&quot; is essential, and will amortize out because you will not stop with just one Microplane once you see how useful it is"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,great knifes for the price,"I have had these knife for about 3 months now and have not had any problems with them. The only thing I noticed is that the big knifes will get some rust spots everyonce and awhile in the dishwasher, so I just hand wash them. No Biggi"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,4.0,A decent buy,What I liked is that it is 100% cotton however what was disappointing was the quality of the cotton--- its bare vs a better quality where the threads are thicker and maybe threadcount greater.

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Top of the line,I've had 3 scrapers and I can honestly say this is the BEST of them. I crushes from vegetables to dough so easily. The handle allows a very firm grip. Not heavy or too big. It wonderful and I reccommend it without a doubt.
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Best Electric Kettle Avaliable,"Unfortunately no electric kettles are completely stainless steel.  The manufacturers always leave some plastic exposed to steam or water.  Having said this, Breville has managed to put together a very well designed and durable electric kettle.  I have owned Krups and Breville and would only recommend Breville.  I own two Breville Electric Kettles and would buy more for personal use or gifts. "
kitchen & housewares,26 of 26,5.0,Excellent Knife,"I took a knife skills class and immediately fell in love with this santoku. It has a hollow and extremely sharp edge and the length allows you to smoothly rock the knife to slice quickly and effortlessly. The granton edge helps keep food from sticking to the blade while slicing and the knife itself is well-balanced with a solid bolster and tang. The wide blade is also wonderful for scooping up from the cutting board to bowl or pan. This knife is going to be my workhorse, no doubt about it!"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,It's not for ricing anymore!,"I never bought the ricer for ricing potatoes.  Instead, I bought it to squeeze the juices from raw potatoes to make hash browns and potato pancakes. I've used it for 3 mos. continually without a problem.  It is truly a quality product.  I have also used it lately to rinse water from herbs and other soft leafy vegetables before chopping.  Talk about a verstile kitchen gadget"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,Not what they seem...,"I purchased this set of flatware because I wanted a set to match my red appliances.  I feel really dissapointed in this purchase.  The handles are not riveted as they appear. I thought these were all stainless steel with the red plastic part actually riveted on like the ones I have seen in stores.  They're not. The handles are plastic and the silver parts are painted on.  The paint job was poor.  The painted ""rivets"" were smeared on a couple of the handles and the silver paint was scratched and rubbed off on the ends of the handles exposing the black plastic underneath.  "

You can turn it on, set a bowl on it and zero it out then fill to desired weight, very easy to use. Great for measuring out precise amounts of bread dough for very even sized rolls. Great for gram weight when mailing a letter or anything light weight that requires a precise weight. You will love it as much as I do, I'm sure of that"

We have owned an espresso machine in the past, but it was nothing like this one.  It grinds, compresses and dispenses the espresso automatically and the frother has the milk steamed in about half the time of our old machine.  The Saeco machine is easy to clean and my husband loves to make the coffee in the morning now.  I have had no difficulty with this machine at all.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic ice cream scooper,"My wife and I purchased the black model of this item 4 years ago.  We have used the scooper on average once a week and absolutely love it.  It's solidly built, has a comfortable grip, and performs as good as the day we bought it. We have never had a problem with ice cream sticking to the scoop surface."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,I love it!,"I absolutely love my little george forman grill!  Whereas before I didn't cook much, I now make chicken and fish and such pretty often because it's so easy on this grill.  And the bun warmer works fine for me, just put the bun in when you start cooking and it's nice and warm when you're done.  Highly recommended"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Anolon Review,"One of my hobbies is cooking, I love to cook and the Anolon Advanced is one of the best Skillets I have ever used.  I have had AllClad Emerilwear, Calphalon, and others, I would trade them all for the Anolon cookwear.  It's the greatest"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 9,5.0,The only wine opener,This wine opener and kit are the cat's meow!  This is a must have for the wine person!  It is awesome - less than 3 seconds to open a bottle!  Totally awesome product.  This is a must have for everyone and a great wedding gift as well
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful item!  Down comforters were always too warm for me, and this turned out to be perfect.  I highly reccomend it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Another winner,"I love it. I hated pizza cutters because I had only used the ones with handles, and none of them had serious blades like this one. Now I let my chef's knife rest again, since this little wonder cuts pizzas very cleanly."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Easy to Clean, Great Gripping Action -- But a little hot","I purchased these mitts because I was pleased with my Silicone hot pad and wanted to try out silicone mitts.  My first impression of these mitts was that they are much easier to use than regular oven mitts -- you feel like you have much more control with your hands.  These particular mitts have little grip ""bumps"" all over both sides of each mitt which make handling hot pots and pans even easier.  We even use the mitt as a grip to open jars!  Works perfectly!  Dishwasher safe?  Another plus!  However, if you're carrying around a pot for a long time (not just holding it steady, actually carrying weight with full mitt-to-hot surface contact for more than one minute) you can start to feel the heat.  I would say for most general cases of taking things in and out of the oven and placing them somewhere, they are perfect.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking to switch to silicone"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Great brush set!,"This is a great set. Very sturdy, well made. A great value for the price"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,1.0,Not The Best Choice,"I had high hopes for this mandoline, but I unfortunately have had to return it and, for the first time, I feel a certain responsibility to write a review.  The blades of this mandoline are dull, dull, dull.  When it arrived, I first tried slicing an onion, which actually was somewhat successful, although the slices were torn and uneven.  The carrot I then tried was more shredded than sliced. Forget tomatoes -- do not try tomatoes, period!  Unless you want tomato juice and there are easier ways to get tomato juice. This mandoline will definitely slice potatoes and cucumbers although the slices tend to be uneven, but perhaps I wasn't applying even pressure.  However, I haven't had this problem with my V slicer which, I guess, for now, I'll continue to use. My advice would be, don't buy this one.  "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,great glasses,"I have had these glasses for about 10 years.  I love the size and shape and durability.  I have broken only one, and that was thanks to my ceramic tile floor.  Any other floor and the glass will survive.  None of the remaining has even a chip. Mine unfortunately have hard water stains all over, so I'll probably break down and buy a new set of them soon"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Its a Rip off!,"I wanted to have an onion cutter that would make my life easier. after buying  this i found that it was tough to use. I had to apply all my body weight to cut onion. 2nd day , it broke. "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Fiestaware Deal,Product arrived packed very well and quality was outstanding !
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,sturdy knives,"These knives were $3.99 and i bought them with a $25 dollars off with purchase of $125 promotion, as an afterthought.  I really like them because the blades are thick and very sharp, and the quality is very good.  i used one of them to open boxes today, no problem.  i don't agree that the knives are flimsy, as one reviewer stated.  although the handles are plastic and colorful, they are a much better quality than many plastic handled knives i've seen. AND, again, at less than $4, who can beat that"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Botanic Garden Kitchen Wall Clock review,"The Botanic Garden Wall clock arrived in good shape (except for my having to turn the battery compartment/hanger slot on the back to the proper position.  Also, the instructions in the box were for another type of clock entirely, so I had to figure out the directions myself - not very hard, fortunately).  However, I'm pleased with how pretty it looks in my newly decorated kitchen alongside my new botanic prints.  This clock would make a great gift as well"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,perfect,"I own many pyrex pieces and this is one of many. This is a piece that you will use for many times. I've baked macaroni and cheese to cobbler in the oven, made salads, store vegetables, mashed potatoes to various desserts to store in refrigerator as well as freezing spaghetti sauce in the freezer. You can use it in the microwave as well. Dishwasher safe. I love that it comes with a glass cover. Doesn't hold stains or odors. A beautiful sculpture design that is very attractive.  A definite piece to add in any home. I got this as a wedding gift 29 years ago and still looks new. Highly recommend this piece"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,4.0,mushrooms no problem,"I use this slicer to cut mushrooms around 2-5 times per week.  I've had it for less than a year.  It works great.  The slices are nice and uniform, it is easy to use.  I bought two on a Friday sale because I had concerns about the durability after reading the other reviews and the product was so cheap.  After much heavy use slicing various types of mushrooms I feel this slicer is durable.  And yes, it does sound nice when played like a little harp"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Great product for single or small servings,"This is one of those TV ads that really didn't exaggerate. I love this system and have bought refill sets for more containers. The thing I like about this the best is the small storage room it takes but also the containers are great and the lids are the best. The lids are the only ones that I've found that really are easy to snap on and they are TIGHT! You can turn the container upside down with no leaks. I take them to work, I freeze in them, I microwave in them, I eat from them. Really saves me some money by being able to freeze leftovers."

kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,1.0,There are better.........,"ways to juice!  Was excited about this attachment, but found it awkward to use. Slow and juice will run down your arm unless you hold the citus just right. For large amounts found myself cleaning strainer quite often before I could proceed with juicing process, can do large amount of juice with my other juicer without pausing. Used this a few times but found my small electric juice was quicker. IMHO better to put your money with a better juicer.  Will give away this attachement to anyone who wants to try it!"

As a Scout for seven years and Assistant Scoutmaster for almost three, I have over ten years experience with the BSA and cooking on campouts. In scouts we don't fool when it comes to our dinner and neither should you. Iron Lodge is the best of the best when it comes to camping cookware. Don't be fooled by yuppie la-di-da, Martha Stewart dutch ovens. This is the BIG DOG, so if your ready for serious beef stew or cobbler this is the real deal.    "
kitchen & housewares,42 of 42,5.0,"Quiet, Solid, Fast","    I bought the Krups GVX2-14 to replace a Braun burr grinder that I have had for about 8 years.  The Braun was still working, but it was getting slow and noisy."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Super Basic But Spot On.,These tongs retain the timeless stamped metal feel of the equivalent from restaurants and canteens we all know.  
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,4.0,Great set,"For almost two years I've had this set, along with a few others in the same product line that I've also purchased.  I use at least a few of these daily.  They have great weight and balance, good heat distribution, are easy to clean (especially the nonstick pans), and are very reasonably priced."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,5.0,These a very nice,I love them. They are very big. I like that about them. My friends love them when thay come over each person uses the same same design each time so we always know who's is who's. I am always poka dots.   
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,My favorite pan,"I bought this in June 2003 and have used it on a daily basis. When I cook for more than one this is my favorite pan. My concern is that I have used it so much that it is showing some wear and I do not know how to replace it.  I paid under 20 dollars originally.  I have two others, a 24 cm (small 10 inch) and a 22 cm (nine inch)both are great but the big pan is the one I reach for most often.  I always hand wash it and the outside looks new.  It is a great nonstick even heating pan. I wish I had bought two, but then both would have used as much as one."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,4.0,Nice Kettle,I like the style.  It has lots of room.  The whistle works fine.  It should be hard for me to burn it up
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Did not work well at all!,"We were so excited to have this tidy gadget in our kitchen--and after removing the plastic tape over the blade, were seriously disappointed.  We tried sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, carrots...and made a mash of veggies all over the counter with a few julienned carrots and a couple potato slices on top."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Awesome,"I'm getting ready for my own place and bought this because it was on sale. I like how there was almost everything that I need to start out for those first yet attempts at making something edible (hey, tastes good is the next step!). "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,2.0,"Nice Iron, couple of flaws.","I actually do like the iron, I love the steam shot, but the spray needs to be redone, it never hits my clothes, it always sprays above and beyond my clothes onto the floor.  I just don't use that feature.  My problem is with the retractable cord, as a previous reviewer stated, you have to wrestle with the cord to get it to fully retract.  Well, in doing so, mine broke.  I have to hold the cord under my hand now when I'm ironing.  Otherwise, it just shoots right back inside the iron.   UGHHHH!! That drives me nuts.  I guess, it doesn't really pay to try to get a little more fancy with your iron.  I'm going back to the good old stand by"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,very versatile,"I like that this mandoline makes so many different kinds of cuts, but it's still compact. It did take a few tries to get comfortable with it, but it's worth the effort. I takes me less than half the time to make cucumber salad and the results are beautiful. I had trouble with tomatoes too but I called OXO and they explained that you can go on their website to see how to slice softer items like tomatoes with a straight blade mandoline. It worked pretty well. Still, it's a great product for potatoes, zucchinis, try it for shredded cabbage. A real time saver"
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,The glasses are fine; Amazon doesn't know how to ship them,"3 of the 4 glasses arrived broken.  The UPS delivery man was a bit humiliated to hand over a box containing obviously broken glass.  I should have listened to the other reviewers...the packing for these is all but non-existent.  I would say, ""Don't waste your time.""  If they had arrived intact, they would be fine, although I think 6 oz. is pretty large for martini and martini-type drinks"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Bulb Info,"I am looking for a new book light, and as a former owner of this light, I was suprised at the bad bulb stats.  This bulb, like halogen bulbs, get very hot.  It is imperative that you do NOT touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it.  The oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp. and hastens failure.  Hope this help"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,5.0,Add some spice to your life!,"This handy little gadget will not only save time but will also save your finger tips from certain injury! A spice grater is a must for those who cook with nutmeg, cinnamom sticks, and even pepper corns. Though a coffee  mill may seem an east way to grind these often you need a more controlled  grate as opposed to pulverizing the spices. This is where this gadget works  best. The handle is also excellent and easy to grip which is important as  this is certainly small work. In the end just throw it in your dishwasher  and the work is done simply and easily"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,4.0,This turned out to be exactly what I thought it would be.,"The pieces are not the heaviest out there, but I didn't think that they would be at this price.  They are certainly not light.  The pieces are the size I expected them to be also. The photograph captures the pieces well."
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,4.0,Food saving mania,I originally got this from a friend who told me how much better the food was when vacuum sealed.  I have a big picnic at the end of the summer so this year I got an extra freezer and then I heard about this.  Each holiday this summer I would go to the sales and pick up the various meats that were on sale then I would take them home and freeze them and seal them.  
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect Toast,"After reading all the reviews, I crossed my fingers and ordered this toaster, anyway. I guess I was one of the lucky ones, because it looked like new when it arrived, and toasted perfectly every time.  I love the reheat feature"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,The Whiskiest!,"Unlike some of the previous, uneducated reviewers, I knew prior to ordering this item that it was not used for making Whiskey. I knew that it was for beating things, such as eggs, whipped cream, and unruly children. (The latter is an optional use - I would use the 11-inch whisk, also available from amazon, or a heavy iron spoon). In short, this tool does its job with aplomb. I enjoy whisking all manner of items, and find myself using this item when it really isn't necessary at all. Just this morning I whisked myself a milk and organge juice smoothie, and followed that up by vigorously whisking my bowl of Rasin Bran. Sure, flakes and milk ended up all over the place, but each cereal shard was coated with nice frothy milk. I have even used this whisk to create my own flavors of toothpaste, mixing the best of several of my favorite brands into one bowl and wisking it into a greenish-brown blob of tooth-whitening goodness. Overall, this whisk is superb at doing what it was meant to do, and then some. I think I may use it tonight to whisk together a bowl of chiken soup puree! YUM"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,I love this machine!,"I am new to juicing, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a juice extractor. I bought this Breville and have been so happy with it. I use it several times a week and think it is really easy to use. Cleaning the unit is a pain, but I think that it comes with juicing territory. I would recommend it to anyone who want to start juicing"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Use it indoors and outdoors,I've had this thermometer for over a year and I use it constantly. My favorite way to use it is on the grill outside. Pork loins and chicken breasts cook fast on the grill--it's best to know exactly when they're done. I just leave a window open and listen for the alert. A busy Mom's best friend
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Utterly Perfect,"As a longtime collector of Homer Laughlin's Fiesta, I can say this pitcher might be the apex of design. It is form AND function, beautiful and sturdy.

kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Quality makes a difference,"I've got a cheap-o chef's knife and I've got this little 3 1/2&quot; Wsthof paring knife.  It's a testament to the quality of the Wsthof that I'd rather use it, even for big knife jobs like chopping vegetables or cutting meat.  The quality of the blade more than makes up for the lack in size"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,2.0,picture doesnt match colors,"I bought this and the colors are much golder than expected.  In dim light it looks bronze/brown.  Also, the material patches between the silk started ripping only 1 month later, before i had even washed it."
kitchen & housewares,27 of 27,5.0,wonderful for a trip,"I purchased this cushion for my cat to have in her carrier when we drove from Texas to Florida. We went for Christmas, so I knew it would be a little chilly. This cushion, not only allowed her to be as comfortable as possible, and actually enjoy the ride, but also kept her warm. I also sprinkled cat nip on it, and she enjoyed it that much more. while we were in Florida, she stayed out on my dad's Lanai. it got a little bit chilly, but she would go sleep in her carrier, which I kept open for her to go in and out of at her will. now that we are home, I keep it in a corner of our room, and she still loves to sleep on it. I have washed it a few times, and it is still just as nice as when I purchased it. I'm so glad I purchased this item, and I don't know how long it'Ll last, I'm guessing quite a while.....but once it needs to be replaced, I'll definitely buy another one!!!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Darn good baking dishes.,"These thing work quite well. They are very sturdy, very well built. I am sure they could double as a home protection device if needed, and would still be in perfect working condition. These things are heavy, like solid steel"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice sheet set!,"These sheets are VERY comfortable! Soft out of the bag and not stiff at all, which is why I bought the 800 tc and not something higher. These sheets also fit my incredibly tall mattress, miracle of miracles! They may even be a little big, but I'm sure that they will shrink down in the dryer. So, for those of you that have the ""tall"" mattress, don't fret, these WILL fit it! Two thumbs up for this sheet set"
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,Best Thermometer/timer I've used,I've been using this for at least 10 years and I love it.  It's only on it's second set of batteries and it's used almost every day.   I haven't had any of the problems with the probe that I've read about and that also gets used frequently--probably at least once a week.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,"POOR C,S.","I have had 2 machines, nierther one has lasted very long, when I called thier custormer service it was a joke,Once they found out that I needed to return the item (full size) they hung up and woul dn't answer the phone when I called back"
kitchen & housewares,47 of 47,5.0,The roomba is worth it- but know what you're getting. ,"OK. First let me say that this product is amazing and well worth the money. As an engineer, this thing has amazing obstacle avoidance software, and it navigates rooms extremely well. I put a good deal of research into this vac before I bought it - so let me tell you what you can expect, and more importantly- what not to expect. The majority of reviews that are negative are from people with defective units or people who expected something completly unrealistic. On a side note - all of the units have the same capabilities. So I would recommend that you buy a slightly cheaper unit to test it out. If you really like it, then buy the schduler seperately. The high-end vacuum is no different than the low end one. The only exception is the red - which doesn't have ""max"" clean mode. I personally recommend the sage unit that comes with the home base. It has everything you really need to fully test out the unit - the home base is particularly useful, but the black basic remote (not the white scheduler remote that comes with this unit) is not very useful. "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 14,4.0,Good mixer,"The Delonghi DSM5 appears to be a decent mixer. I purchased one in February 2006 and have made several batches of 2 loaf bread and a few cakes with it. It can easily handle 5 or 6 cups of flour. I haven't tried it with more yet. My mixer was purchased online from Etronics.com. Their merchant is Comerexia (Comerexia.com). I would not make a purchase from Etronics/Comerexia again. Etronics online advertising for the DSM5 says the mixer is 820 watts. Those who have done their research know that this mixer is supposed to be 780 watts. When mine arrived after an unbelievable 40 days (yes it took them that long to ship although the item was listed as in-stock and ships same day or next business day), the label on the mixer said 750 watts. I contacted Delonghi to ask why the discrepancy and they advised that Etronics/Comerexia had sold me an older unit. In addition, Delonghi further advised that they will not honor the warranty because they have no control over the quality of the products sold on that site. They referred to Etronics/Comerexia as a sort of online auction website and not a registered seller of their product. The unit is supposed to come with a 10 year warranty on the motor. I now have none, even though the Etronics website says in big bold letters next to the item description ""This Item Is Brand New Factory Sealed and Comes Complete with USA Warranty!"""

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Wonderful little pan!,"I use this pan for making hollandaise sauce, and other sauces that make about a cup.  It works for warming butter or making a basting sauce for somthing on the grill.  Barbeque sauce warms up nicely for barbeque ribs.  I know I will find other uses for it, too, but I bought it especially for packaged sauces that make about a cup.  The base is nice and solid, it won't blow over beside the barbeque grill"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Love them but hand wash them,"I have had this flatware for many years and have recently acquired a dishwasher.

kitchen & housewares,7 of 18,1.0,IT'S A STUFFER - WHAT CAN YOU SAY.,"I bought the whole kitchenaid system and thought that i would make some sausages.  there's not much thought to the stuffer (it's plastic)  however, the kitchenaid is not worth the effort.  1st: you can't just buy the stuffer, it has to be used with the grinder attachment; 2nd: when you install the attachment, on the counter, it extend the kitchenaid to about 6-7 feet in height (you'll have to climb up on the chair/table; 3rd: it does not stuff easily, meat goes all over the place (leeks through the attachment), the plunger does not plunge, meat sticks and it is hard to work with, you'll spend roughly 1/2 hour trying to get meat into the stuffer, into the sausage, and by the time 1/2 hour is over, you merely stuffed about 2 feet of sausages.

kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,1.0,I like OXY but hate this product,I'm usually pretty satisfied with the design and quality of this company's products. I used a $9 martha stewart one for years that finally warped and dulled but it did slice tomatoes. this one was so dull it couldn't slice anything. I returned it immediately. Its soured me on the straight blade design but I don't see higher end units with the angled/diagonal blade and they don't have as many cutting choices so I'm quite stuck
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,great rolling pin,"After years if using a handled rolling pin I finally decided to get one that suits my rolling style. The handles on my old pin were wasted space and my old pin's rolling surface wasn't as wide as I wanted. So, I decided to look for a French pin or straight bakers pin. When I saw this one my little brain immediately said 'A HAH!!! This can be chilled!' And as those of us who frequently make pie dough, the colder the better for a flakey crust."

kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,Nice alternative to teflon,"I've decided to replace my teflon pans with cast iron and this is one of the first ones I bought. So far it has been excellent. The large size is fantastic, though it's definitely heavy. My arm muscles are getting a workout! I'm glad I got it pre-seasoned, since that was one less thing to hassle with. I have found that cooking with cast iron makes food taste better. Kind of surprsing. I'm not sure why this has been the case, but my husband and I have both noticed it. I have to say though, it is very different than cooking with a regular teflon pan. At first I kept burning everything. Cast iron gets very hot and maintains a steady hot temperature. I'm finding that I'm basically cooking everything in this pan on med-low heat, where I would have used medium heat. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase though and plan on getting a couple more cast iron pan"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Get a Grip!,"Like much of the Le Creuset line, these dishwasher safe round silicone hot pads have multiple uses. Covered with ridges they make excellent trivets for resting hot pots and pans on while allowing for air flow. The ridges also make these perfect to set eggs on so they don't roll off the counter. They are firm enough to use as a fan when a little air movement would come in handy. Combined with the ridges, they are flexible enough for opening jars and bending/gripping around medium to large handles. "

It cost so little, and it still works, so it is small complaint"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Critical for the beginner!,"This is a good all-purpose test kit for someone beginning freshwater fish-keeping.  It's also the most economical way I've found to purchase a wide variety of tests (it contains test solutions for pH, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates) in large volume.  The directions are clear and concise and the color coded cards make readings easy"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,roshco cookie cutters are a big hit,I have not used the cookie cutters for cookies yet.  I purchased them  for our 6 year old son who likes to use them with play dough while learning his alphabet.  It makes it a fun learning experience for him.  There are also numbers which can be used for the same thing. I am happy with the quality of the product. I was also satisfied with the service and ordering process.  The shipment of the product was quick too
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent product !!,Keeps coffee hot for hours. No more burnt taste from traditional coffee makers. Just heat water from a kettle to get carafe hot then brew your coffee. Simple as that. A little pricey but worth every penny

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Coffee Grinder/Power Generator ,"If you were looking for a quiet humidifier, this is a falsely advertised and disappointing product.  Even after letting it run for 30-60 minutes, this humidifier was too loud, even closing the doors couldn't mask the loud, grinding, and machine-like sounds of this ""humidifier"". buyer beware"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Perfect sized serving bowl,"This vegetable bowl is just the right size.  Not too big, not too little.  I like it that it's just like the cereal bowls, only bigger"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Worth the money,"After purchasing the Tassimo and returning it, I tried the Krups Home Cafe at a friends house and then purchased my own.  The biggest plus in my book is the ability to change the strength of your coffee. No the latte and cappucino are not as good as starbucks but lets face it, this machine doesn't cost several grand either. They have so many drinks to choose from including two new teas! I couldn't be happier and my friends haven't complained either"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Good and biiiiig...,"I bought this set on sale at a local store for almost half the price amazon is offering right now. The tools have a good feel and they are well made, the only problem is that they are kind of big even for my big hands. The spoon has some scratches at the tip after only a few uses on nonstick pans. The canister is big and nice looking with plenty of space for more utensils"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Amazing Smoothie Blender,"I make a smoothie every day with close to ten types of whole nuts, 15 whole grains, 10 different types of frozen fruit, Yogurt, Apple, Orange and Cran Grape, and throw in some greens today supplement.

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Not a Blizzard, but Great","I like this fan for its versatility and power.  It can be set to focus moving air or to blow intermittently (as a breeze) and/or to disperse the air almost like an oscillating fan.  The remote works very well even though I initially thought it ""over-the-top"".  So far (after a month or so of use), I believe this is an excellent fan for general purpose cooling of a room or two"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Great Glasses!,I originally bought a set of these several years ago. Have since broken a few. I was greatly pleased to find that these are still available.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great for soups,"This is such an improvement over the standard stainless pots most people have. I love making soups and this is just perfect for that.  It is quite heavy, but that's one of the nice things - it's solid!  Great purchase - well worth the money"
kitchen & housewares,15 of 15,5.0,"If I can handle this, so can you.","Drape the tortilla in the bowl, bake. Wipe clean.  The tortilla bowls are crisp and excellent.  I am a middle-aged guy just learning to cook.  You can handle this too"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Nice pan ..,Nice pan but I find the handle a little on the thin side...ie for gripping. I have an average sized male hand.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Love Fiestaware,My husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me. I thought okay until I opened the package. This shamrock green is so pretty. This dinnerware is great. A nice heavyweight. The glazing is brillant. And the cereal bowls are a good size. Not too small as other types tend to be. I am very happy I own this and have bought more since
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great pan,"I loved this pan so much, and got a great deal on it, only $20, or so.  It's a great size.  The pan fits nicely on the burner.  It's small enough to cook just a little, but deep enough to cook more if you need to.  Heats very evenly and cleans beautifully.  I was going to get one for my sister who cooks as much as I do.  I let her try it, intending to buy her her own if she liked it.  Well, I've never gotten my pan back!!  She loved it.  "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Fast, easy and perfect low cal snack","After reading about all the harmful chemicals that possibly end up in microwave bagged popcorn, I decided to look into a hot air popcorn popper.  I use this machine at least 3 times a week.  I really like it other than it is a little loud and blows popcorn dust on counters and floors and I wish it had an on/off switch other than unplugging it from the wall.  I have a GFI protected outlet so I don't feel too uncomfortable with this issue.  It makes great popcorn and pops most of the kernels.  It makes the perfect low cal, low fat, high fiber snack with minimal effort and preparation and easy clean up.  "
kitchen & housewares,21 of 22,5.0,Best grater I've ever owned,"I just got this grater and I was blown away with how sharp it is! It makes grating so easy. At first I was a little skeptical about the manufacture's claim to having razor sharp teeth but now that I've tried it - I know they are for real. The grater seems to effortlessly shave through everything without tearing or shredding the food. And b/c it was so effortless, I could just hold the grater over my food and grate right onto it. I would highly recommend this grater and will definitely be looking to getting some of their other graters. Cuisipro well done"
kitchen & housewares,22 of 24,4.0,the nectar of the gods,"I will repeat what everybody else says about the included strainer not being worth anything.  It is small, easy to lose, ineffective, etc.  "
kitchen & housewares,22 of 22,5.0,The cats in your life will love you...,"My pet sitter told me about this cool little disc. It looks like a frisbee. After you heat it in your microwave for 6 minutes, it emits heat of 120 degrees Farenheit for 12 hours. I use it to keep a homeless kitty that has adopted me warm at night. I just heat the disc, stick it in a box under some blankets on my porch, and the kitty is ecstatic. He sits on it like it's an egg, purring. It's safe and very effective on cold winter nights. This is a really great gift for anyone who loves cats."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"Cooking is fun, cleanup is not",This grill works best with hamburgers and pre-cooked hot dogs.  I seldom used the bun warmer though.  The only drawback was the grill plates could not be removed to facilitate eassier cleanups.  This eventually made me dread cooking on it because it was such a tedious task to degrease and rinse. The next one I buy will definitely be the one with removable plates
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Great product!,"Purchased this slow cooker after my other one bit the dust. This is an EXCELLENT slow cooker--it looks small in the package, but holds more than you think. The teflon coating is perfect for easy cleanup--aluminum container is light to pick up and move (with oven mits). I've not used the bottom as a griddle, but purchased this as a true slow cooker. I've done chili, soups, meats and am very pleased. Watch the temperature controls until you get used to them. The tote is a bonus-easy to store that way and keep it unscratched, but I've not transported anything. I've tried several slow cookers and this is simply the best design and performance. Light, easy to clean, fairly large (mid-size roasts) capacity. You shouldn't be disappointed if you buy one"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great product,"I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware.  Best set I have every owned or used.  Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots & pans."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,WOOOOOWWWW,"I have used the same dish ware for the last 15 years and haven't really been looking for anything new.  Then I saw this collection and I just had to have it.  I started with just a few pieces and in just under 3 weeks I have most of the set for 4 and will soon take the it to 12 settings.  These pieces are so whimisical and the colors are so rich and vibrant and what makes this even more special is the story that goes with these pieces.  No matter how you dress your table these can go from everyday casual to dressy with just a few accessories.  Great pieces, buy'em all....."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,arrived dull.,"The peeler in this set is good for larger vegetables like potatos.  My husband uses it, since the handles are large and fit his hands better.  The parer arrived without the blade having been sharpened.   The blade does require repeated sharpening.  The parer was larger and more difficult to use than I had expected.  Again, it seems to work best for someone with larger hands"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Great Price, Excellent Quality!","We purchased these new knives about 2 weeks ago. The price is excellent, and the quality is superb. The tangs (that is the metal part of the blade that goes inside the handle) goes right to the end with 3 fixtures keeping in place, making these a very solid knife."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Make Coffee,My husband and I use it every morning to make hot water for our instant coffee.  It works great and is very fast.  We love using it very much and highly recommend it
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,I LOVE IT - UPDATE,"I have had this little coffeemaker for about 1 month and it is great. I got it a Walmart for $15.00 and I just love it. It works well and I use it everyday. I have a large coffeemaker for morning coffee but for a cup of coffee later in the day I use this and have been surprised at how good the coffee made in this taste. I use the pods and ground coffee as well, although I prefer the pods. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a cup of coffee at odd times of the day, I have tried the de-caf pods and had coffee in the evening and it was very good also.        UPDATE                                                           This Proctor Silex coffeemaker stopped working after about 6 months of use. I would not give it 5 stars now. I purchased 2 coffeemakers and the first one is used more frequently and is still working but not sure how long before it also stops working. Just cannot recommend it any longer, so I wanted to correct my review"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Beautiful and a great price,"This looked like a great deal and it was. We like the feel and weight, it is a really nice set.  I would buy this again!  It shipped faster than expected.  Very Pleased"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,going back for seconds!,"I love this pot rack - I bought it two years ago for $35 and it looks and works fabulously - we bought extra hooks and it holds everything.  We're renting out our house and moving to a bigger one and I'm back to buy another pot rack for the rental!  The price has gone up, but still for under $50 it's a great deal"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 10,5.0,The Best Garment Steamer,I bought this Garment Steamer last month and I love it. I cannot believe that I stayed this long without one. It is convenient and quick to use. It takes away the wrinkles in seconds. 
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Absolutely perfect.,"I have an incredibly small kitchen that's just finishing a remodeling two years in the making. Since no walls were knocked out, utilizing every square inch of space is still a priority, and this knife rack does it in style."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,1.0,Pretty Blender Shaped Paper Weight,"This is our fourth new blender in the last three years.  My wife and I prepare one large smoothie everyday that has no ice, but lots of frozen berries, fresh fruit, etc. Nothing else goes in the blender. This blender looked nice and was so heavy it implied quality. It even worked great for a few months. Then one day the gear that delivers power from the base to the jar stripped right off. Now it is out of warranty. This is not simple to replace since the plastic/rubber piece separated from the steel shaft. We paid close to $100 for this thing so spending a couple of hours bringing it to someone who will charge $25-$50 to repair it seems like throwing good money after bad.  "
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,Great for the kids to use-fun!,"Works pretty good. The kids love it, can use it with ease. works better if you spray interior with Pam first. You can use one to four eggs at a time"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Good Value,"Wow, the price has come down.  I bought the set when it was 15 and for the price the glasses are great.  The glasses are only 9 ounces so they don't hold too much liquid and when full they are very easy to spill since they are so wide rimmed at the top.  Other than that for the price you can't beat this deal"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great item!,This was a beuatiful set of bakeware very carefully packed.  It was also a great value for the price
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,excellent coffee maker,"I bought one of these, based on the postive reviews here, for my wife after she complained about the relatively new Mr. Coffee leaking and dripping. She says (I'm not a coffee driner myself) this is the best coffee maker she's ever had. It doesn't leak or drip. It makes excellent tasting coffee. The no-drip feature that allows you to remove the carafe while the coffee is still brewing really works! Also, the non-slip handle on the carafe is really nice and helps you keep a firm grip on the pot. Last, but not least, the compact size fits nicely on the counter, under cupboards, etc."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,cheri,"I love the glass set!  They are very pretty but also sturdy.  With teenage children, fragile glassware is not an opiton.  So these are functional yet very decorative!  Will not hesitate to buy another set once the kids go through these!!  The only flaw was that two were broken in shipping, but that was not a product flaw, just a shipping problem.  Need to find a better way to package before shipping"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent value for the money,"I have bought many sets of these Bone China, not only for myself but also for my friends as gifts.  They are beautiful, functional, and durable.  My whole family loves cooking, and the set, particularly the soup bowl, is a joy to use.  The soup bowl can be used very well for pasta. "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,What a beauty!,"I had a traditional alluminium pressure cooker and one day I decided to treat myself (after a lot of research) to a WMF Perfect Plus 6.5 qt pressure cooker. It is so easy to use and has an outstanding built quatily to it. I can honestly say that I am delighted with it. I know it is a bit on the high end as price is concerned, but one definitely gets what one pays for. As I said, what a beauty"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Grind and Brew,"I bought this as a gift, but found that I liked the coffee from it so much I have just about taken over operations from my fiance, who is a verified coffee fanatic.  This unit has saved me a fortune, as we can have excellent coffee without the Starbucks trip.  I don't know where the low star ratings come from, but I couldn't be happier with a coffee maker.  Why did I labor all those years with the cheapo Mr. Coffee's and others of that ilk?  Five stars!!"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,Pyrex isn't Pyrex anymore,"Corning Glass Works used to make Pyrex, a name synonymous with borosilicate glassware.  Corning spun off its kitchenware division in 1998, and the Pyrex brand is now owned by World Kitchen, Inc."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,5.0,Holding up to heavy use - A great item!,"I've had this model for quite a while, maybe a year, or thereabouts.  I have to say that for the price, and the convenience, this little thing is a wonder.  Mine is kind of beat up, and parts are scotch taped on, and yet I use it daily.  I have a dog and a cat, and I'm in and out of the garden with tracking - all the time.  I can run this over hard wood floors, and some throw rugs even.  It's no Dyson, but if you just want to tidy up for company, and you don't want to drag out the vacuum, this is it.  I haven't seen any other products that let you wet mop and vacuum too. "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 14,1.0,Loved it until it broke,This was the perfect good-looking replacement for boring Pyrex and I used it often - until one day it suddenly cracked right down the middle while I was roasting a small turkey breast in the oven. Makes me completely wary of purchasing another as they're quite expensive. I have a similiar roasting dish from Cost Plus that's made in Portugal and is still going strong. Wish I could find more of those instead. (much cheaper
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Works fine.,"Like all Good Grips items, this is easy to hold and use. Have used it with a variety of frostings including butter cream, sour cream and  creme fraiche, and cream cheese with no problems. Applies nicely and evenly for small and large hands alike. Works much better than the improvised alternatives of butter knife and/or plastic spatula."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,What you would expect from a commercial smoothie maker,I was looking for a new blender to make smoothies with after burning the motor out on two previous ones.  I was also tired of having to stick spoons into the blenders and mash down the ice/fruit to get it to blend thoroughly.  The Back to Basics Smoothie Maker solves this problem by providing everything you would expect to find in a commercial machine.  
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Like them so much I bought spares,"I purchased the 4-knife set with the small wood block. These knives are so sharp, you better be careful how you handle them. And they're so reasonably priced, handle them a LOT!!! I use them for everything you might imagine you'd need a sharp knife for. Some of the things I use them for might make you cringe, but hey -- I've got spares and at this price, I'll likely buy more!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,My new favorite gadget!,"I bought 2 sets of these to use as stocking stuffers for my girls, and thought they were so cool that I ordered a set for myself.  I've already found them useful for pouring peppercorns into my peppermill & adding ingredients to my little Cuisinart grinder.  Saves on messes!  The girls loved theirs, too"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 5,2.0,Not very impressive,"I thought the drying rack was pretty poorly made from really cheap wood. The thing reminded me of something you would make in woodshop in junior high school. Maybe that's why the reviewer ""Dennis"" likes this rack so much...it reminds him of his rare school accomplishments. The rack is nice looking but considering the price, it is no bargain. The wood splits on assembly because it is of poor quality. I liked the way it looked, but as for it being functional and sturdy, I would say other products would do better."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Best peeler I've ever had!,"This peeler cuts through potato and cucumber skin like butter.  My son  loves to peel things for now!  I no longer dread the task of peeling.  My  old peeler took forever to perform the task of peeling potatoes.  After  using this peeler, I'm sold for life on OXO"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,1.0,Please don't waste your money.,"I purchased this for use with my smoker, right out of the box, it worked great. The controls are intuitive and well designed.  Worked like a charm until the second time around when it started registering inaccurate temperatures.  I was extremely careful with the probe, not getting it wet or crushing it. I've tested many thermometers and this is by far the worse.  It now registers about 50-80 degrees too hot. "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great product  but inaccurate desciption,"I love the color and the cause, but this set is slightly misrepresented here. I am glad to have this product, it is pretty and is good quality, but as someone mentioned in another review, the measuring cups do not come with a leveler as pictured and described. I went to the Kitchen Aid website and the same set on their website is not pictured or described with the leveler so the set pictured here must be an older version of this set. Also the set lists for $9.99 on the Kitchen Aid website and not $14.99 as stated here. Today I was in a well known chain store and the same Kitchen Aid measuring cups and spoons, exactly the same except for the color, sold for $6.98. I still would buy the pink for $3.00 more, but the pink set lists for $9.99 and not $14.99. Regardless of the leveler no longer being offered and the list price being inaccurate, it is still a good product and I am glad that I bought it. I love having pink measuring cups and spoons. Very good quality too"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Easy crock pot to handle,This is the best slow cooker I own. Having a disability I cook meals in advance and put them in on low to warm so they are hot when my husband comes home for dinner. It is so light and easy to clean. I would purchase a larger one next time

kitchen & housewares,9 of 10,5.0,Awesome!,"I was baking cookies tonight for an exchange at work tomorrow.  When looking for my cookie sheets I noticed this airbake one.  I vaguely remember getting it for Christmas last year, but have never used it.  I put one set on the airbake and another on a regular cookie sheet (neither with any grease) and my normal pan burned the bottom and didn't cook the cookies through.  The airbake worked perfectly!!  The cookies barely stuck (after removing the cookies, you woulc barely tell that I had just baked on it).  I recommend them to anyone.  I even tried one more identical batch switching the airbake and regular sheets in the oven to make sure it wasn't because of the racks that they were placed on.  It wasn't.  Airbake definitely works"
kitchen & housewares,14 of 15,5.0,Rustic Pie Dish,"One of my favorite desserts to make is deep-dish caramel apple pie with streusel topping. I bought this green Emile Henry 9-inch pie dish to make that recipe, and I was so pleased by using the dish that I soon bought more matching pieces. Emile Henry has been manufacturing their individually-crafted pieces for more than 150 years in France, but they've only been available in the United States for about 20 years. This pie dish is their signature piece, with its fluted edge and ribbed exterior. It's hard to see just how beautiful its transparent color glaze is from the picture. It's made of high-fired Burgundy clay, and its glaze is resistant to cracking and crazing when used in a microwave or conventional oven, or under a broiler. It's dishwasher and freezer safe, too. There are a few cautions: use an oven mitt or thick potholder because the dish can get quite hot, even from the microwave;  don't put the hot dish on a cold or damp surface; and don't put the dish directly on a stovetop heat source. This pie dish is very durable, chip resistant, and has a one-year warranty against breakage. I also use it to make sweet and savory tarts and fudge pie, which is difficult to bake to a proper consistency in any other pie dish than this one. The earthenware holds the moisture in and ensures that the pie is baked evenly through the center"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Not an Economical Purchase,"I bought these for my wife a few years ago based on their reputation.  The price was very high, but I figured it would be a lifetime purchase.  Wrong.  Within a year or so the finish began to wear on the saute pan.  The frying pan held up for about 2 years then did the same thing. As others have posted here, we never, never use metal utensils on these pans, yet the pans lose their low-stick capability after being used on high heat.  Once this occurs they are actually worse than regular Farberware or Revere pans in terms of sticking.  The pots, which we never used for high heat cooking, are still in good shape.  For the price (which is lower here than I paid at Filenes), I think it would be smarter to buy 2 or 3 sets of conventional Farberware or Revere.  I have Farberware pans that are 30 years old that have held up better than these overpriced gimmicks"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 10,1.0,Buyer beware!!! A big disappointment and a lot of anguish,"Made in England. So it says. What I received in the box today is not a Churchill Chealsea Tea Pot but some teapot made in Malaysia. What is up with that? I suppose I have to go through the proper channels to get this straightened out. Be prepared to spend a lot of time dealing with this matter. There is no savings at all, when one counts precious time and emotional upheaval. A really big disappointment. Maybe this was an April Fool's joke, not a pre-Christmas present."

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Top Tea Kettle,This is an excellent product. It is convenient efficient and easy to use. I particularly like that it automatically shuts off when it reaches the boiling point
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,A great tool,This product is wonderful.  You can get any cookie off the cookie sheet without scratching the non-stick surface.  It is also useful for removing bits of things left on non-stick pans.  It scrapes almost anything off anything without leaving a mark.  It isn't a heavy duty spatula and It wasn't intended to be used for heavy food or scooping. I love it and have bought several for friends who love it
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great deal,"I am an avid cook and decided it was finally time to throw out my old beat-up non-stick cook ware. I purchased 2 sauce pans, and 3 saute pans from this line. All of them cook fantastically. I had to set my range on pretty high heat to sear anything in my old cookware. With these pans medium heat is all you need to get a nice sear on steaks, chicken, burgers, fish, or whatever you may be cooking. Preheating time was pratically cut in half, You can put them in the oven without worry, and clean up isn't bad at all. For the price amazon is selling these pans at, you're crazy if you pass up this line of cookware. 5 stars without question"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 10,1.0,Dangerous machine. Knife spins with cap off.,"The Braun KSM2 Coffee Grinder is a very dangerous appliance.  My wife just got her fingers chopped up while removing the lid, after grinding some coffee beans.  She is in the hospital as I type this.  I hope it is only stitches.  The problem is that the rotating blades still strongly spin after the top cap is removed.  Very, very dangerous and it should be taken off the market"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,LOVE IT!!,If you are looking for a kettle that is both stylish and functional then this is it. It gets the water to a rolling boil perfect for that cuppa tea!! Also I love the fact that it has a bell to tell me when the water is ready if I am not in the kitchen. All around it is worth every penny!
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Utterly Fantastic!  One of the Best!!!,"This 4-in-1 Multimix by Braun is simply fantastic.  I've had mine for 7 years...that's 7 years of HEAVY use, meaning at least daily use and it's finally about to kick the bucket. I've just ordered my replacement and thought I should go ahead and pipe up with my comments and thoughts on this wonderful product!  I've used all four attachments on al manner of items and never had a problem with a ""wimpy"" motor...in fact, the motor on this baby seems to be quite powerful.  The chopper is small, so it's not going to take the place of your food processor if you use it for making big batches of stuff...but if your family is like mine and all you really need is to be able to make small batches of salsa and chopped veggies...heck I've even made a huge amount of roasted red pepper sauce for salmon in it...then the chopper attachment is going to be perfect for you!  The stick blender is great for smoothing/blending soups (like cream of potato) or tomatoes and has such force that it suctions to the bottom of the pot/bowl you're working with, so you don't have to worry about power being a factor here!  The dough hooks are ideal for things like pizza dough and small batches of rolls....you wouldn't think so looking at them, but go on...give them a try, you'll be surprised at how well they work!  Finally, the mixer/beaters...they are some of the best on the market and stand up well to even the thickest batters without any problems.  Additionally, clean up couldn't be easier...wipe the unit down and all the attachments remove for scrubbing (obviously you can't submerge the stick blender or chopper), but these are easy enough to rinse right after use and to a quick scrub and rinse with the rest of your dishes!!  So you can see why we're so pleased and I can tell you that I'm looking forward to receiving my new one and that I am looking forward to at least another 7 years of service with this one!  I give it five stars and recommend it without hesitation! "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Great for making baby food!,"I have owned this chopper since my first born (2002) was just 8 months old and used it for her to make table food into baby food.  I now have another daughter born in May and I broke out my trusty little chopper and it still works great for chopping up a bit of meat, veggie and rice or potato to make fresh, homemade baby food.  My daughter thoroughly enjoys having a bit of texture to her dinners now that she is 8 months old and this leaves just enough texture to food that it is not like soup for her.  "

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Skillet,"Lodge has lived up to it's reputation once again. Having cooked with cast iron for many years both indoors and out I was intrigued by the new design and that it was pre-seasoned. I purchased the 8"", 10"" and 12"" sizes of this iron skillet and after a quick clean-up with soap and hot water and a little time on the stove with some oil in them to dry them out completely I started using them. I did find that the first time or two of use some of the things cooked did stick a little but now the skillets are working very well. We purchased a set of them for our daughter who is getting married as a wedding gift and our other daughter wants a set for her famil"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,1.0,Motor dies,"The motor of this thing died and almost burned my hand in the process. I was trying to chop raisins (bad idea, however no word about that in the instructions... they tell you to not chop cheese, but nuts are said to be OK) and after a couple of seconds, a spark came out of the button where I was holding the blender(since you need to press the button to have it work, you have to hold it there).

kitchen & housewares,67 of 69,5.0,Excellent product! + Helpful hints.,"Excellent product! I've had a Tilia FoodSaver Vac for about 5 years (I asked for it for my birthday) and have never had a problem with it. If the person who said that one corner didn't seal will check the rubber on the lid, it may have slid to one side and isn't making contact with the bag when trying to seal it. This would make it not seal completely. No one has offered hints to make using the Tilia FoodSaver Vac more economical or practical so here are some suggestions: (1) When making a bag, if the meat(as an example) is a steak 8 inches long, make the bag at least 12 inches long. The reason for this is that the bags can be washed and reused over and over until they're too small for anything to fit in and still seal."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,Lasted 3 days,"I purchased this knife for cutting home-made bread in a slicing-guide. While I liked the look and feel of the knife, it lasted about three days - after that the blade would ""wiggle"", but wouldn't actually cut anything. Amazon happily took a return, and I will be looking for another electric knife to try"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Calphalon Stock Pot,"Excellent price for a high quality stock pot.  Very heavy steel with solid glass lid keeps pot from ""rocking"" while allowing visualization of ingredients.  Very pleased with purchase and speedy shipping"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"The strainer in the lid is a good idea, but . . .","I purchased this saucepan specifically because it has a straining/pouring feature in the lid.  The idea is great.  However, it isn't quite as effective as I thought it would be.  This is a 3-quart saucepan that holds alot of water, especially when you are cooking pasta or potatoes.  When you go to pour the water out the pot is heavy to lift and you have to lift it and hold it at a certain angle to get the water to drain out.  Sometimes you think all the water has drained but it hasn't. If you are making mashed potatoes and all the water didn't drain, you have a problem you didn't expect.  Maybe it just takes getting used to.  I like the saucepan and it came in red which I wanted but trying to use the straining/pouring feature is harder than I expected.   "
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,2.0,It Is What It Is,"I bought mine several months ago and use it exclusively for espresso.  That I would give it 4 stars.  As for customer service, all they have voice mail telling you they will call you back but they never do.  For that I give them one star."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,You Want This Pan!,"What a great buy. A terrific pan for putting together a one (or at most two) pan meal. Flat bottom is large enough to saute veggies and aromatics, while the sloping sides are great for stirring in a sauce, al dente pasta, or whatever you're adding. Goes from stove top to oven with a great glass lid. Much better than the average saute pan in my opinion. There's no reason whatsoever to go to the much more expensive All-Clad version"

I think the odor coming from the plastic body and cap,so I highly suggest to clean the cap every time you boil it, even the odor from the body is almost removed, the odor from cap still show up. Right now I have used it for three months and hard to smell the odor. BTW, the filter is just a thin plastic film only under the mouth and you would not expect it can clean the water so much"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,2 Years of use and going strong!,"After reading some of the negative reviews I decided to stand up for this great little machine. I bought mine from Amazon over 2 years ago (mine is model 555) and have been very satisfied with it for several reasons. I like to brew using different methods, though primarily pump espresso, and the grind has always been perfect for the process used. The grind is consistent and my coffee is always perfect. I have been grinding my own beans for over 20 years and used several different grinders, but this is unequivocally the best I have used. I only have problems with static when the humidity is too low, but have found this easy to overcome. The only problem I have had is the plastic receptacle recently cracked, but this was easily and inexpensively replaced by Capresso. As for the noise, grinders are noisy - no getting around it. But really, who cares? It only lasts a few seconds."

kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,5.0,BEST grater out there,"Microplane graters are the sharpest graters I've ever bought.  Easy to clean, non-rusting, and cuts grating time in half (at least!) because they're so incredibly sharp.  Also means you don't have to work so hard.  More costly, but worth every penny"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Very nice set,"This is a great dish set for Thanksgiving entertaining. The dishes are made of a high quality English earthenware that is microwave and dishwasher safe. The plates have a nice scalloped edging. The full color decoration is traditional old-fashioned looking engraving of a turkey in the outdoors surrounded with Autumn blackberries, acorns, oak leaves, and  wild roses. The design is based on original old Churchill company engravings. Eight place settings come with the set, each setting consisting of a 10-inch dinner plate, 7-inch bread and butter plate, 6-inch bowl, teacup, and saucer. Plus 5 serving pieces are included with the set: 2 open 9-1/4-inch diameter vegetable dishes, a 6-cup covered teapot, a creamer, and a covered sugar bowl. Very nice, and the company sells matching itmes at Amazon to complement the set"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Worth the extra work,"Coffee presses work pretty much the same way.  I like Bodum presses because they have yet to let me down.  If you're going to get one (and you should)spurge a little and get a nice one.  You will be happier that you did.  My first was a plastic one and the plastic would expand and contract when I poured in hot liquid which made the thing feel unsturdy--even though it wasn't.  Then I got this one and it's great for just $30. Even if you REALLY spurge and get a $60 press, the glass beakers are replaceable should you ever break yours.  So why a press?  It is a lot more work...you have to boil water, steep, press, then dump out used grinds and wash your press right after each use.  But coffee presses allow the natural coffee bean oils, which are extremely aromatic, to stay in the coffee...and not get wicked away by the paper liners/filters.  Your coffee is richer and more flavorful.  Who wouldn't want that"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Solid Unit - Good Value,"Makes a nice replacement for the George Foreman grill in that it can do steaks, burgers, chicken breasts - AND does a great job with the Panini! The floating top grill helps provide even grilling across the entire surface of the meat or Panini. It seems well built, heats up fast, and cooks evenly. The indicator lights are a little hard to see in a bright kitchen, so that could be better. The manual is all of one page of actual usage instructions, but it did come with a nice cookbook with lots of great panini ideas. All-in-all, a pretty nice unit."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Great Set!!!,"I beg to differ from the previous review.  I just purchased the set and it's great.  The handles have been enhanced with color  coordinated silicone so they don't get hot.  I even purchased the 12-inch skillet and the covered sauted pot because it's a wonderful set for the price.  Regardless if you are just starting out or adding to your collection, this set is great"

kitchen & housewares,27 of 27,5.0,The Best Value In your Kitchen!,"    First off I enjoy quality kitchen tools. I never minded paying for a quality tool. But when you get prenium quality at a rock bottom price, well it just doesn't get any better than that. Also any of the cast iron products from Lodge will easily last a lifetime or two, with minimal care. I previously owned a 7 quart duch oven and loved it. But my daughter finally has moved out, and it's just the wife and I at home now, so I downsized to a 5 quart dutch oven. I was happy to see Lodge offer a dutch oven with side handles instead of a wire bail, because we do most of our cooking at home in our oven, not at a campfire. The 5 quart dutch oven and 10 inch skillet would be a perfect gift for someone just starting out in life. They probably would not realize the value of what they recieved, until they are cooking a pot roast or a pot of chili for their grandchildren thirty years later"

kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,4.0,Sleek little oven,"I bought this as a replacement for my old DeLonghi convection which my daughter was taking off to college. It toasts fine, and I would have given it 5 stars xcept that Sanyo decided to call it digital. Yes, it has a touchpad for 1, 2, or more slices of toast, but what's that about???? This is not a microwave, so the toasting should not be quantity-dependent; why not just have us toast longer?  There is also a touchpad for temperature which is calibrated not in 50 degree increments as are our reg ovens, etc, but instead at such odd temps as 180-250-320-400-470; maybe the boxes of frozen food say different things in Japan?  That said, I think I will adapt and be able to use this oven just fine.  It is exactly the right size for my counter, prettier than my other one, and the shelf is conveniently attached to the door so the food slides out toward you when you open the door, without burning yourself on the hot shelf"

This has been a wonderful pan and I like the results as well or better than the Foreman grill. I wish they had a lid for this pan because with some meats I'd like to turn the heat down and slow cook.

I thought that it would help people to know that almost 4 years later, it is still in tip top shape. I use a grater a lot. At least 3 or 4 times a week on average. I never buy pre-grated cheese, I grate my own. I make cole slaw at least once a week & use it to grate the cabbage & carrots. It has no rust spots on it at all. And is is still very, very sharp! I wash mine in my dishwasher. I have had friends & family who have admired mine & ended up buying one for themselves."

kitchen & housewares,21 of 24,5.0,"Four gallons of chili, mhm...","This is a huge pot. It may look small in the picture, but it's 4 gallons, so it'll fit a lot of food. It'd be great for lobsters, I suppose, but if you are not inclined as to boil live animals, this pot is great for stews, soups, and chili. It's really big, but it has an extra thick bottom that distributes heat evenly, so no spot gets heated more than another making for good stews. Left on very low heat, it can pretend to be a slow cooker. Also, it's made of stainless steel and no food sticks to its sides or bottom. I have been using it constantly since I got it and I highly recommend it.  I got it on sale I'm really happy with it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,2.0,Doesn't  Vacuum Seal Very Well,"I recieved the FoodSaver Vaccuum Seal system as a gift along with two 11"" continous roll bags.  They worked great but were kind of big for some of the food that I was trying to vacuum and seal so I bought the premade package of 48 quart size bags.  I have had nothing but issues with those bags since I got them.  They will not vacuum and seal correctly.  When I make my own bag with the continious roll material the vacuum and seal works great but not with the quart bags.  Even when I have tried both types on the same night, the continious self made bag works the quart bag does not.  The vacuum system works well but the quart bags do not.  They look and feel like they are made from the same material.  The only difference is that the quart bags are about half the width of the 11"" bags and they don't stretch across the whole vacuum seal area like the 11"" bags do but the manufacturer does mark-off where the optimum vacuum seal area is so you can make sure your bag covers that area and the quart bag does stretch across that area but still will not vacuum and seal.  I am just going to buy the 11"" roll and make my own bags"

I have purchased two white and one red.  There is no way that you can purchased a better mixer for the money.  Why buy 3?  I bought the first for my wife approx. 2 years ago then several months later I purchased one for my oldest daughter as a gift, then in Jan 2006 I purchased another one for my youngest daughter as a gift.  The last one is used in baking cakes, etc. for resale.  All machines preform very well with no trouble.  Thanks for a splendid machine.  I highly recommend the KSM90 300Watt mixer over all the rest"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,really good price and works well,"The santuko knife is the best knife I've ever owned. Of course this is because I cannot afford to spend $90 on a knife that I say this. If you want a good semi-precise knife set on a low budget this is pretty good. I do have to sharpen the santuko knife a lot but that is because I use it several times a day and sometimes on a glass cutting board. From what I understand that will dull a knife pretty quickly. Be careful,it's sharp, I've cut my fingers twice with this knife. The smaller knife is great for cutting open a bell pepper. Over all, I like this set. It's getting me though all the healthy home cooking I do. But I'll probably buy something a little higher quality in a couple of years."

kitchen & housewares,4 of 8,1.0,Everything sticks to this pan!,"Believe me, I dearly wanted this pan to work out. It costs well over $100. However, no matter what I did, everything I cooked in this pan stuck. I tried using it without greasing it, greasing it with oil, spraying pam on it, putting ghee/butter in it etc. The following things all stuck: pancakes, eggs, hamburgers and chicken. In fact, every thing I tried, stuck. Also, the shape was strange as most of the surface area was off the heating surface. Also, they have this 1"" label on the bottom that was hard to get off. I finally did but once I cooked something, when I turned the pan over there was a microscopic film of glue from the label that I wasn't able to get off and it had turned brown. Ugggh, this was the worst cooking experience of my life. Needless to say, I returned this pan... "

I like the variety in sizes.  One will be ideal for almost anything you make."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Better &amp; Safer,"So much better and safer than deep frying on the stove.  I had read the reviews and they were mixed so I decided to be my own judge and I am very satisfied.  It is so much cleaner and easier to handle.  Previous reviewers commented on the odor.  I have to say, compared to deep frying in a pot on the stove-this is basically odor free.  The suggested timings tend to be off.  I suggest checking your items frequently before they burn.  Once you test it out a couple of times you will know what timings suit your quantity and type of cooking.  Also, it would be helpful if T-FAL provided a few straining filters, just to get started"

This one does and I think it is just smashing !! I can control the temperature, it heats evenly and leaves nice grill marks on the food.....It is perfect for someone like me who does not have time to wait around for a charcoal fire to heat up and does not particularily like gas grills..... From onions to eggplant and shrimp to steak, this little cookery has lovingly seared my heart....It's just great !! It is certainly worth owning and I can highly recommend it to everyone !! "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent Guest/Camping Bed,"I'm not sure of the defects that other reviewers have had, but I've had this bed for more than a year and it's exactly what the description says.  "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Totally amazing kinves for the price!!!!!!,"These knives are amazing for the price. you can't beat it! they are sturdy, cut amazingly well, never need to be sharpened and i haven't had any problems with rust! I never put them in the dishwasher because i know that they would probably start to rust. its so easy just to hand wash them. Nothing will stick the to blade so its an easy rinse wipe and your done!! For anyone looking to buy great knives but don't want to spend a lot of dough, this is the buy for sure"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Kitchen Aide 750 Food Processor...Awesome!,"This machine is awesome.  I love it, I use it several times a day.  It is a workhorse!  I make breads with it.  Pie Crust that is tender and flakey in ten presses of the pulse button.  I received it for Christmas and I doubt there has been a day that I haven't used it.  The bowl is sturdy...dishwasher safe.  It comes with a hard plastic tool box that contains the dough blade and the other cutting blades.  Easy to store...I love it"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,This vacume is awesome!,"Consumer Reports gave this thing a glowing review... rated in the top 10 amongst $500 cleaners. (and higher than any Dyson I might add)   I've owned it for about six months, and I couldn't be happier with it.   It picks up A LOT.  Hence, you have to empty the thing every time you use it.  Think for a moment... if it didn't fill up so fast, all that dirt and dust and doghair would still be in your carpet!  "
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,1.0,Black & Decker Gizmo,"As far as the Gizmo is concerned, it is among the worst products I have ever purchased.  It was placed in the trash. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,1.0,QUIT WORKING AFTER 49 DAYS,"I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS POSTS....I HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR 49 DAYS AND IT JUST UP AND QUIT....HARDLY USED IT, ONCE A DAY TO COOK LUNCH FOR MY 3 Y/O DAUGHTER.  THATS IT, NOTHING REAL DEMANDING, MAYBE 15 MINUTES OF USE A DAY, MORE OR LESS.  THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT, RIGHT UP TO THAT POINT.  I AM IN THE PROCESS WITH DEALING WITH DELONGHI NOW...WE'LL SEE.  I WOULD NOT PURHCASE THIS PRODUCT OR ANOTHER FROM DELONGHI.  49 DAYS IS RIDICULOUS, ESP. WHEN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.. I SMELL A LEMON COOKING"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,"Uhh, it SAYS they are 16 in long...","If you buy these tongs you know you are buying 16 inch long tongs, i mean cmon'.  This is in reference to the below reviewer.  I own the 9 inch and the 12 inch tongs from this line and am VERY plesaed with them.  i just did not buy the 16 inch ones because i knew they were mainly for the bbq, unless a person has a specific need for them.  So to all, the other lengths in this line are great, and if you need 16 inch tongs i would definatley reccommend them"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Coffee grinder,The coffee worked very nicely.  I ordered it to grind flaxseed and it did a good job.  The flaxseed still has whole seeds but not bad. 
kitchen & housewares,4 of 9,4.0,nice little mixer,"This is a great little mixer for every day baking. Its light in weight and has enough power for cake mixes, mashed potatoes, and whisking cream and egg whites.  I wouldn't use it for really heavy batters like cookie dough as it doesn't feel like it packs that kind of power. "
kitchen & housewares,22 of 23,1.0,Don't bother...,"If I had known this was not the ""real"" heavy looking Bavarian pan as it looks to be in the picture, I would not have purchased it. It was a complete waste"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 11,1.0,"Unfortunately, I got a Dud","I just got this machine and went to break it in, per the manufacturers instructions. Before baking bread, you have to run the machine on a bake cycle while empty in order to burn off the manufacturing oils. It went through the motions of kneeding and baking beautifully. I let it cool down to room temperature and then proceeded to assemble the ingredients for my first bread recipe. When I plugged in the machine and turned it on nothing happened. The display would not even come on! It appears to have burned itself out on the very first use. :(  I ended up making my bread the old fashioned way. My friend who has the same machine but different model (TR220C) swears by his and has been using it at least twice a week for year. Maybe I just got the lemon of the bunch?"
kitchen & housewares,26 of 26,5.0,great loaf pan!,"My first observation while taking this strange pan out of the box was how big it looked, it measures 13 x 15.5 and another 2 inches counting the handles, also a generous 1.5 deep. The thing is rubbery and flexible and I was skeptical. The sled is great for keeping it stable. I very lightly oiled it rubbing with an oiled paper towel (PAM would work well) as the instructions said and put my whole wheat bread dough into each compartment. Into the oven it went and WOW did it come out great! The loaves puffed up all around even on the bottom, they pulled away from the pan and fell right out! I tried mango bread yesterday without oiling it, it did try to stick a little where the fruit touched the pan, so DO OIL IT LIGHTLY, you also need to cool quick bread a bit as usual before unmolding, unlike yeast bread which jumped right out. I also like that the sides are straight up not angled so when you slice the loaves you get a nice square slice! Nice you can work the pan off the loaf pushing the pan inside out thanks to it's flexible nature. I also like that 3 mini loaves is exactly the recipe for 1 regular loaf, baking time was just a hair shorter then for regular loaves at the same temp. You will be amazed how nice they rise up and evenly cook. Order several when they are only 9.99, they make nice gifts"
kitchen & housewares,29 of 29,5.0,Never knew I needed these...,"...until they were given to me as a gift.  Now I would not be without them.  The shape alone makes them worthwhile, especially for the spoons.  Think spice jars.    Plus they are also very sturdy...the handle of the measuring cup will not bend back or break off as you're digging into hardened brown sugar,etc.  You can melt butter in them and it won't easily scorch.  Fantastic!  Did a woman design these???"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,If you want waffles this is the way to go,"Never was a big waffle person but I like the throw big brunches so I thought I would incorporate a waffle station.  Very easy to use, hardly any cleanup (just butter the grids a little before each waffle), and makes them quick, probably every 4 min or so.  I am definitly enjoying this unit, looks great too came in perfect condition.  The only thing is once and a while the timer does not go off.  Seems to be every third waffle so I keep an eye out for that. (hence the 4 stars)  But this is so worth the $40"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Nice Tray,"I have ordered many pieces from the Melissa line so far as I really like the pattern.  As for the tidbit tray, it is much bigger than you might think from the picture (and the price), but it is made of plastic (melamine) which if I remember correctly, is not mentioned in the description.  I would have to say, for the price, especially if you get free shipping, this is definitely worth purchasing"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Excellent Product and Service,This is a well made beautiful cabinet. It arrived well packaged and already assembled except for the shelves which are adjustable.  Some brackets were lost in transit and quickly replaced.  I definitely recommend this product
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Higly Used, High Quality","A chefs knife will be your most used Knife in your collection.  Why would you want to pay a lot of money for one?  Expensive, high quality knifes hold their edge (sharpness) longer.  After almost 6 months of daily use, mine needed sharpened ($3 for a professional to sharpen it).  You should also invest in a honing steel.  This will not sharpen your knife, it will only realign the blade and keep it sharper longer."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,was good.now trash,"This brush was great for awhile on my grilled stuff, as well as on all of my baked items. Unfortunately after about ten washes half of the bristles came out at once! Oy. Don't buy this one unless you don't want something that lasts"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,2.0,2 Stars Only For Looks,"If your buying a toaster for looks but don't care how it toast, this may be what your looking for.  Not one of the four slots can toast evenly, one side is done while the other hasn't browned at all.  I expected much better performance for it's price.  You are paying for the looks because this toaster is cheaply made.  I've also tried a Dualit because I wanted a toaster that was made well, but I experienced the same outcome. I have come to the conclusion that the cheaper the toaster is, the better it toast. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,Excellent Pie Pan,"I just received my pie pan and I love it.  It is heavy duty and very well constructed and very deep -- don't have to worry about spill overs.  Have never been able to really find a ""deep pie pan"" and this is exactly what I wanted.  Now that I see what a great pan it is I wish I had ordered at least 3 or 4 at the fantastic price of $5.99.  This was definitely the best bargain I've gotten"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Nice shaker for one or two people,"I purchased this shaker a couple of years ago and have given it a lot of use. First let me say that this is a very good shaker and performs very well. I read some of the other reviews and I have not encountered any problems with the lid sticking or the shaker leaking. It performs as advertised and is a good value for the money. The only drawback might be if you want to make cocktails for more than two people at a time. It's a bit small for that IMO but if you are mixing for one or two folks at a time, it's the perfect size. Another plus is that after many washings (by hand only), the finish has held up like it was brand new. Along with performance and functionality, it is a durable product as well"
kitchen & housewares,17 of 17,2.0,Hard to use,"This is supposed to be a universal double boiler, but it's hard to use because it fits no pan well -- making it hard to stir, and giving you a limited &quot;surface area&quot; for use.  Also, due to it's curved bottom, it won't stand up on its own if you remove it from the &quot;boiling&quot; pan (to set beside you as you mold candy, etc."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,An excellent oven thermometer,"This oven thermometer has been very accurate and easy to read in the oven.  I studied the other ones before I bought and I am not sorry about my pick.  I have a new stove and was having trouble adjusting to the oven.  The bell would go off that it had reached the temperature in 10 minutes, but it would really take almost 20 minutes.  Having the thermometer really helped me to know when it really hit the right temperature. "
kitchen & housewares,17 of 18,5.0,Versatile and worth every penny!,"I've owned this dutch oven for 3 years now and I must say, I use it at least 3-4 times a week. It is so versatile that you can make anything from soup to chili to even stir-frying when necessary. Although after using it for about a year the bottom looked really yucky, I bought some of the Le Creuset enamel cleaner and it was as good as new again. I love this pot and recommend it to anyone who wants a piece that they can use for almost anything. My only complaint about Le Creuset items is that it is extremely heavy due to it being made of cast iron. However... that's what makes it so durable and will last you a life time"
kitchen & housewares,18 of 18,5.0,cooking tip for a nice looking checkerboard,"I used to have a checkerboard cake pan that I loved.  I finally returned it to my sister after &quot;borrowing&quot; it for about five years, so I am ordering this one to replace it.  The old one was metal, so I'm pleased with the new plastic separators that come with this one.  I experimented a lot with different cake mixes, and discovered that the thicker the batter the less the two flavors bleed into each other--for a more even checkerboard look.  The best mix I have found was Duncan Hines Butter Recipe Golden for the light part and Butter Recipe Chocolate for the dark.  They taste great too.  I'm sure other butter recipe cake mixes would work well too"
kitchen & housewares,11 of 12,5.0,absolutely perfect,It is a joy to make sauce with this little pot.  Only the lowest flame is needed.  The handle stays nice and cool to the touch too

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,OXO Ice Bucket,Your product was exactly as described.  I had shopped around for a long time but never found an ice bucket that was as nicely made or had the extra feature of a clear lid.  Yours was the best deal.
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Nice pot for gumbo,"I made a very large batch of shrimp gumbo in this pot yesterday that nearly filled the pot.  The pot gets used often and has held up well.  Fortunately for me I paid 1/3 of the Amazon price with free shipping and no tax.  Should have bought more than one.  I am amazed that Amazon sells this for virtually the same price as Williams-Sonoma, the price-gougers of cookware suppliers. I love Amazon but this price is too high"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,I love it!,I purchased the Hamilton Beach Brew Station Deluxe about a week ago after spending a couple of months of on-line product comparisons and reading customer reviews on Amazon and several other sites.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Love It!,I love this stuff!  I have had many sets of this corningware and I keep getting more.  It comes in such a variety of sizes so I can always find the perfect one that I need.  It can go in the microwave and the oven.  And nothing I cook ever sticks to the inside of it when I clean it!  I highly recommend this for your kitchen needs
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,2.0,Passing,I bought this coffee maker because I am the only coffee drinker in the home and one cup is normally enough for me.  The quality and taste of the coffee is fair at best.  I normally have to microwave the water before adding it to the maker to get the coffee hot enough for my enjoyment.  The heating element just doesn't get cold water to the proper temperature.  All in all this coffee maker is just passing enough to enjoy a blah cup of joe on weekends.  I will be in the market for another model soon
kitchen & housewares,14 of 46,1.0,waste of money,"I bought a product from Calphalon Commerical Non-stick product line and it was great, so I thought the new Calphalon One should have better quality as they are promoted. It turned out to be a big mistake. I used the product once and it was discolored, besides the cleanup is not as easy as the non-stick edition. I decided to return it right away"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Henckels Twin Cuisine 8-Piece Knife Block Set,"I Like the knoives alot, they are very well balanced. They don't quite hold a perfect edge for as long as I would like, although my expectations may be overly optimistic.  In general I am very pleased."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Just Like McDonalds,This item is so useful yet affordable. Make you own Egg McMuffins and is CHEAP!!
kitchen & housewares,8 of 10,5.0,"Heavy, beautifully made, did I mention HEAVY?","All Le Creuset is beautiful--you can hang them on your pot rack & just ogle them, altho they are also great to use! This 6-3/4 Quart Oval French Oven weighs at least 14 lbs, & I think the weight & quality is obviously part of the appeal. But, if you have a ""bad back"", or are ""downsizing"" & packing to move, as I am, the weight can turn into a negative. Also, you should check around for price--I'm pretty sure Amazon had these at a much lower price a week or 2 ago, & there also good deals on the main online auction site. BTW, I have the Citrus Yellow, which is my favorite color"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,5.0,Great Gadget,"Some of the reviews I read indicated there was a problem sealing.  If you follow the instructions, it's the greatest gadget you will ever buy.  I scoffed at a vacuum sealing system, foolishly thinking a zip lock bag would do the trick.  But, I was wrong.  I have shared my delight with this product with several friends.  I'm glad I purchased the FoodSaver"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,beautiful flatware,"This flatware has a very solid feel to it.  Utensils are long, you will have no trouble getting to the bottom of a big peanut butter jar with one of these knives!  The desert/salad forks are the size of the dinner forks in my old set.  They are extremely shiny (especially compared to the ratty old stuff I replaced...).  I do notice myself polishing away water spotting from the dishwasher, but that is probably because they look so darn good when they are perfect and shiny.  I have only had the set for 3 weeks, but so far I am very pleased"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"After two years, still in great shape","I had to come back to review this item, after having used it for two years.  The construction of this pan is top-notch.  It's an item that actually deserves the ""commercial"" rating, unlike some other high-end cookware that I have used.  Stock up for the holiday baking season"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Practical cooking tool..,"...easy to use, easy to clean up. Because it is designed for storage, with a lid, you can keep it in the fridge for as long as you like, allowing you to drain the yogurt for varying lengths of time, producing varying textures of yogurt cheese.  I am very pleased with this product - it is just what I was looking for"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 18,2.0,Awful on polished tile,I was looking for an easier way to maintain my new polished tile floor.  This machine left the floor wet and streaked.  I even went out and bought the lambswool attachment to polish the floor and it was ineffective.  At this time I am back to a mop and bucket.  Also the cord is quite short

kitchen & housewares,9 of 11,1.0,Watch out for the brush drive,"It cleans well when it works...  I clean once a week on about 400 square feet of regular carpet for 19 months.  I've had 4 of the $10 belts that drive the pump break.  The pump and the brush are all part of the same unit.  The plastic used for the brush drive wheel is very cheap and has failed on me 3 times.  It only cost $40 for that part.  Since you have to replace it all.  None of this counts labor, which I do myself.  The store that I get the parts from have  know which parts fail by heart.  Also for them it is a great money maker with people bringing in broken machines at least 3 times a week.  It cleans carpets well, along with cleaning out your wallet.  I would strong suggest you look else where for your next vaccum."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,5.0,Best Blender Ever,"This blender is easy to use, powerful, and easy to clean.  The most important thing about this blender is that it is SIMPLE--no extra seals that tear, no twisting, no unnecessary speeds.  I highly recommend it."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,It's The Best Buy For The Money On The Market Today,"This machine is not ""breakable"" as someone at this page has suggested.  If you drop it on a tile floor maybe, or it falls from an airplane. Instead, it's the best buy on the market today. We tested all kinds of panini makers. Even the most expensive still produced just a sandwich. This one makes great panini sandwiches for a whole lot less and it will make four at a time. It has a true floating top that allows for sandwiches 2 to 2 and 1/2 inches thick. It's easy to clean off with a paper towel after cooking. It's nonstick so you don't have to add calories with oil or butter. Make a good panini bread yourself or get a nice sourdough roll and slice thinly.  Wonderful!"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Fine grater disc works fine,"Grating very hard Italian cheese by hand was difficult and slow, so this disc makes a huge difference. The disc itself, while bearing the Cuisinart name, was made in China, but seems manufactured to high standards. My only complaint is that some of the cheese remains ungrated and gets wedged under the disc. However, overall the disc does a great job of producing very fine cheese. I have not tried it on anything other than cheese"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,I like my toaster oven!,"    Four months ago, when I bought this oven, I was desperately needing a replacement for my Euro-Pro TO285 X/L Toaster Oven with Rotisserie. A thermostat malfunction and other silly quality issues had caused it to grow cold all too soon. At first I wasn't sure if this new oven would be as big as I thought I wanted. I bought it anyway, and am very glad I did! "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Don't have one?  GET ONE!,"This was the hottest gift we received at Christmas!  I waited a couple of weeks to use it...until my husband could help only to discover that not only could I use it completely by myself, I could do it with three kids running in and out of the kitchen!  It's fast, easy, clean and it was worth every dollar what with all the food that we've thrown out in the past due to freezer burn or the old &quot;I don't want to eat that left-over already!&quot; complaint.  I used to only make ham or turkey for a family get together but not anymore.  I cook it, we eat what we want and seal the rest up with our food saver!!!!  Get one"

kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Expensive but worth it,I have five cats so to me the expense of a few flimsy plastic containers is worth not having to scoop the litter box every day. I usually have to dump the container every other day or so and I don't reuse them. I just toss the thing as intended. It would be nice it they weren't so expensive but I am not giving it up anytime soon.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great gift for self and anyone!,"This Pyrex set is the ultimate gift for yourself and any women or man! It is top quality!  Best storage for all foods, and the lids are so easy to put on and take off, and the vent for the microwave is a great help"

kitchen & housewares,14 of 16,5.0,Excellent Cooking Pot,"My wife loves this cookware.  It keeps the heat very well and it is excellent at browning meat (as opposed to burning the meat).  She also loves that it cooks the food evenly, which other pots have not done well (She has tried teflon and copper pots and they do not do a good job in this area).  She heartily recommends this product"

Dick cutlers.)perfectly balanced andas as rigid as any carving fork sold by the German big names ( Wusthoff /Trident, Henckels, etc.)but at a fraction ofthe price. In appearance this fork will actually match the big names'top knives.My advise: grab one or two before Calphalon realizes that they can easily doublethe price andstill be competitiv"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great pan!,"This pan makes a great cake, without a lot of effort, and the presentation is perfect for your Patriotic holidays, picnics and gatherings.  I used it tonight for a graduation cake with fresh strawberries and blueberries around the perimeter of the cake plate once it was baked, and with Memorial Day and the Fourth of July coming up, I'll be sure to reach for it several more times before the summer is even half over.I never experience any sticking despite the intricate design of the pan.I simply spray the pan  thoroughly without the need to dust the pan with flour."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Gloves that actually work,"These gloves address an important issue--protecting hands even when wet. With these, there is no possibility of getting burned unless liquid were to seep in from the top (very unlikely)."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,one could hardly improve on this fork:A winner!,"Fully forged, with a full tang and bolster and finely finished this tool is akin to a 600 pound gorilla: Stronger than isreally needed, great looking, points as sharp as a samurai sword and the only missing element is the Calphalon name etched somewhere on it; otherwise, the Chinese maker hasn't missed a trick:it matches the Calphalon chef Knife to a ""T"", rightdown to the rather squarish handle which on the chef knives mayoffend some very tender palms but on thefork helps in preventing twisting. While I haven't lifted a 20 lbs turkey with it, Im quite certain that it would not succumb to even a 30 pounder if called to the task. At one third the price of a Henckels or Wusthoff, it is this decade's best bargain in cutlery ; grab one before Calphalon comes to itssenses and brings the price more in linewith the hallowed competition andwhile you're at it, look into the 6, 8 and 10 inch chef knives which, while not quiteas lofty as the bignames' ones,pollish wise, onlyneed a good sharpening to equal their performance: you just cannotmiss!I understand thatthe steel is provided by F Dick - aGerman maker in the Henckels/Wusthoff class.(theKnives are quite heavy, which helps when chopping, particularly when chopping through cooked poultry bones, whichI do routinely without problems or damag"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent Meat Tenderizer,"Very excellent product. A good weight to it for really tenderizing whatever meat you are preparing (chicken, steak, etc...) The two-sided mallot works well, where you can use the flat side on chicken so as not to make a mess, and the dimpled side does a great job on tougher meats like beef to really tender them up. I would highly recommend this item and given the choice I would definitely buy it again"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,5.0,TOP QUALITY!!!!! VERY STURDY,THIS SCOOP IS GREAT. IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW FFROZEN THE ICE CREAM IS THIS SCOOP WILL GET THE JOB DONE. I HAVE OWNED MINE FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS AND IT IS STILL HOLDING UP VERY WELL.
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,You can use this for many things,"I can't say enough about how handy these are. I love my cookie scoop. This one is very sturdy and can take heavy use. One of the benefits of making a batch of cookies with this is that they all come out the uniform size. Uniform size helps in baking evenly and also they just look better once they start out from the same size and shape. They recommend scooping up ice cream for this, but I like the 2 tablespoon size to use when I put muffin batter into a tin, there is much less clean up"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Top Quality, Great Price","I purchased this item about a year ago, after reading several good reviews on Calphalon knives.  I'm a vegetarian chef, so veg prep is a way of life and, as a result, this knife gets used quite a bit.  Washing it by hand (as recommended with all knives, regardless of the maker) and honing it every once in a while, this knife is just as sharp as the day I got it.  This is a tribute to a well made product that is meant to last for a lifetime.  I'll probably have to have it professionally sharpened at some point to keep it razor sharp, but seeing as that won't be for another year or two.  I have since buying this also purchased a spare chefs knife and a paring knife from the same product line and have had similar results.  I would whole heartitly recommend this product to anyone who likes to cook"

I like mine so much I bought one of these for my brother and his wife and they love it too.  I use 1 pod for an 8 oz. cup of coffee and it's great.  The new flavored coffees are terrific.  My dad drank all my cappucino!  I have made tea using an herbal tea that comes in a round pod-like tea bag sold at Wegman's.  I believe the brand is Republic of Tea.  But there are other brands too.

This OXO knife looked like a good yet inexpensive way to start. The knife is well balanced with a comfortable grip and the length is just right for my smaller than average hands. I'm pleasantly surprised by how easy all my slicing and chopping jobs have become, now that I don't have to apply extra pressure like I had to with my utility knife"
kitchen & housewares,57 of 64,5.0,This is the one you want!,"Exceptionally well-designed device to take your beans and grind them with burrs rather than blades to a specific setting --  you choose from nineteen settings! The machine itself is very well made, everything fits together tightly, the motor is powerful -- really a beautiful object, typically great Italian industrial design. This would make a terrific gift for a coffee lover"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Great pet bed!,"My two dogs are very picky about what kind of pet beds we bring home to them. This particular bed was a winner straight away.

kitchen & housewares,6 of 8,5.0,Great Buy!,"This is a wonderful machine.  We didn't know that much about making cappuccinos.  This machine makes it incredibly easy and impossible to mess up!  I was a little put off by the cost, but the quality of the end product and the ease of use make it well worth the expense.  The built in coffee grinder is also fantastic because you can use whole beans which ensures the freshest coffee with each cup."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Works Great nothing fancy to F-it up,this is my third toaster. the first 2 just did not want to work. I read the reviews and settled on this one.

kitchen & housewares,14 of 14,4.0,I like it!,I am impressed with the Breville quality and inclined to purchase the brand in the future. An extremey well made grill. Easy to clean. Easy to use. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Raw foodist perspective: works great for my purposes,"I bought this thermometer to use it with my dehydrator. If you want a living raw food, you need to make sure that the food temperature doesn't go too high, else the enzymes start to die. However, initially is okay to use a higher temperature - you just need to lower it after you get there, and this technique reduces the drying time to half or so. The dehydrator I have doesn't have a thermometer (of course it has a thermostat), so the Taylor comes handy to measure the air temperature to know when it's time to do that. Also, it's very precise."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Prepped and ready to go!,"Mise en place is the French term for having all your ingredients prepped and ready to go before starting you start cooking.  This technique is so important for proper cooking and these dishes really help you break that old habit of cooking and prepping at the same time.  I use them to pre-measure all my spices, juices, liquids, etc. so that I don't have to be rushing around the kitchen as things are burning wishing that I had everything ready.  "

kitchen & housewares,20 of 20,2.0,Description of Color is Misleading,"Amazon misleadingly describes the color of this set of dishes as ""Pantine Green,"" and the photograph shows items that appear to be a bluish-green.  This is completely false.  Be forewarned that the color is in no way green - it is a light, dusty blue.  I ordered two sets, and when they arrived I was disappointed that they don't match my decor, since the dishes are baby blue and my other stuff is green and gold.  So I am returning them, which is going to cost me almost as much as the dishes themselves cost, since each set weighs about 25 pounds.  (Amazon is charging me for the cost of return shipping since they say the return is ""not their error""!!!)  The shape and size of the dishes seemed acceptable - they are your typical stoneware with some faux-distressing to give them that French provincial, flea-market find look.  "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Great flavor and good hot coffee,"We have had the 12-cup percolator for three months now and have had no problems.  Great flavored, really hot coffee is ready for us every morning when we get up.  We've used drip makers for years and no matter what quality coffee, it all tasted the same.  With the percolator, we really taste the difference between just okay coffee and really good coffee. The only (minor) drawback is that the bell icon that lets you know you've set the timer is very small.  Once you get used to that, there are no negatives to this coffee maker."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,The best DVD tower,"For quite a while I had been looking for a certain type of DVD rack/tower...then one day in Target I was looking at the Mission collection and saw the box (no display). It is exactly what I had been looking for. Slapped on the two foot ends and done! Perfect fit for DVDs, 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy DVD cases, like the ones New Line Cinema puts out, you can fit more. I don't have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one DVD per slot. I have many oversized ones. The hardwood is great too, just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall. If you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then...it is worth it. I am almost ready to buy a third one soon"
kitchen & housewares,33 of 34,4.0,almost as good as they claim...,"A nesco is a very good second oven.  It is also very good for cooking your dinner outside (if you have an outlet) on a patio on a hot summer day.  I did find mine easy to clean on the non-stick interior...a bit less so on the outside but still very cleanable.  The issue I have is that is isnt really an excellent unit for crockpot cooking which is what i primarily wanted it for.  It cooks a bit different, the timing is a bit different and the crockpot recipes dont exactly transfer.  It took me a while to figure that out.  You *can* use it as a crockpot but if you are buying it to use it primarily for that I would choose a crockpot instead.  That said, it bakes, roasts very well.  and keeps things warm (like pots of chile or soup etc) for a party excellently"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,This makes the STUFF!,"I received one of these last summer from a box of random housewares a coworker was going to throw away.  What great luck- I am an absolute convert.  It's very easy to make.  The concentrate stores in the refrigerator for weeks and it is free of acidity and bitterness.  My husband has Crohn's disease, and giving up his brewed coffee was a sad day for him, but with this method, he can enjoy a bit of coffee treat because it is so much easier on the stomach.  Just make sure you dilute (to quote copy from another favorite product: dilute! dilute! OK!) properly, as he once accidentally ingested the full-strength concentrate and aptly dubbed it ""rocket fuel."""
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,POOPED OUT,"I purchased this from a local discount store.  I made cookie dough once and it pooped out on me.  I returned it to the store and they replaced it with the same mixer.  Again, I took it home.  I use my mixer at most once a month for cookie dough or cake mixes.  I have had it for over 6 months, but it has quit on me again.  I give up! "
kitchen & housewares,13 of 13,5.0,Works great!,"I purchased this about a month ago and it has made a big improvement in my breathing.  I have allergies and when I used to wake up in the morning I would be all congested, not any more.  This has (3) variable settings High, Medium, Low which is nice because on the high setting it can be difficult to fall asleep, however on the low setting it helps me fall asleep.  I have yet to clean it's reusable filter, as the digital read out shows that it is not yet dirty and I have ran it almost everyday for at least (4) hours at a time?  It has a timer that will shut it off (1-10 hours).  It would be nice if the timer could automatically turn the unit on?  Overall I am very happy with this unit and do recommend it.  Hope this helped, thanks for reading it"
kitchen & housewares,22 of 22,4.0,Very good machine...enjoy the quietness,"I've had this processor for about three months. On the first day, I decided to make bread, and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine. When I called customer service to help me figure out what I did wrong, they told me that occasionally, this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine. I couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor. I'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly"

I am a photographer and was hoping to get some nice shots after everything got going, but after trying to shoot anyway .. the scratches show up bad in the pics.  I am researching to find a better way to clean these tanks and wish I had bought glass to begin with .. but the magnets say they do not scratch .. but they do"

After their rave reviews, I finally brought one for myself. This is an excellent, quality pan.  I have used many tube pans before and this one by far is the best.  It holds event the thinest cake batters and doesn't leak like most pans. My cakes bake a beautiful golden color. I highly recommend.  I recently purchased their 9"" round pans - same quality"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Circulon,Very good. I bought other circulon skillets and use them all the time. Recommend circulon
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,2.0,Nice while they lasted,"The locking feature was great, it made them much more manageable while in use and for storage.  However, the plastic grips starting coming out very soon after I bought the tongs.  Not long after that, the locking mechanism broke.  This made them very hard to use and store, so we chunked them and bought a different kind.  It is probably worth a little extra money to get tongs that last"
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Who knew there could be so many cookie cutter shapes?,"I bought these for my 4 year old daughter to cut play dough shapes.  These plastic cookie cutters are easy to wash and safe for kids to use.  Her favorites are the flower, the star, the heart, and the letters.  Some of the more complicated shapes, like the dinosaur one, are difficult to remove from the cutter and keep the shape intact.  My daughter has also been using them as stencils with her markers."

kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,4.0,Fun soup bowls save my lunch when the phone rings.,These bowls are ideal for spaghetti or soup and so many things. I like the wide lip that helps prevent spilling and drippng. I also appreciate being able to reheat in the microwave. So often when I am having a nice bowl of soup on a cold day the phone rings and my meal gets cold. I don't like having to pour it out of the dish and reheat it then pour it back. Now I just pop it in the microwave and I'm back on track with lunch. I chose the periwinkle color but think I should try other colors too. They are fun to have around and easy to clean afterwards in the dishwasher
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Oh Yeah...,"Absolutely no complaints about the Senseo large capacity water tank.

Bite the bullet, get the large tank, you won't be sorry"

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,Just About Perfect,"I have had this coffeemaker for over one month now.  It is used a minimum of once/day.  I agree with all the other positive posts before mine.  My only complaint is that amount of coffee it claims it makes.  It is supposed to make 10 cups, but my version of a cup and Braun's version of a cup are two different things. I fill the coffeemaker up to the 4-cup level and that is enough to fill up my 16 oz. mug. If you have a lot of people fighting for coffee in the a.m. or you entertain a lot, either get little tiny wussy coffee cups, or tell them to hit Dunkin' Donuts and get their own stinkin' coffee. "

But then it slipped the gear and is completely unusable.  This time I'm going to pay a little extra to get quality and a warranty
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,A must have gadget!,"This is an excellent jar opener. Use it right side up for large and small size jars and flip it over for medium size jars. All you do is grip it on the jar, firmly hold the handles and twist. Your jar will be open in a blink. It has teeth that grip but do not damage the cover. I have not been disappointed with any of the new line of KitchenAid tools and gadgets and I am sure you won't be either. They are excellent quality and made to last. Definitely a gadget must have"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Calibration fails over time,"I have a Polder and a Pyrex, both of which I bought around the same time over a year ago (use them for bread baking and meat roasting).  In the last few months, the meat started to be inexplicably overdone when using the Pyrex.  Tried it again for the Thanksgiving turkey. When the turkey seemed to be taking too long, I plugged the probe already in the turkey into the Polder unit instead. Suddenly my 132 degree temp reading went to 158 and the turkey was almost done! We took it out of the oven based on the Polder reading of 165 and it was perfect. In swapping the two probes back and forth, it is clear the Pyrex unit is no longer calibrated correctly and the probe is not the issue. Kind of defeats the point of using a probe termometer.  I'd go with another brand if you are looking at purchasing one of these."

kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,A Must Have,"I purchased this breadmaker about three years ago.  I was impressed by the 45 minutes from start to a finished loaf of bread.  This is an EXCELLENT little machine that makes a loaf of bread ""Just For Dinner.""  I use mine all the time and keep telling my friends they need one too.  If you decide to make two loaves -- you need to wait about 15-20 minutes for the breadmaker to cool down between, but I've done that when I was having company for dinner.  It was nice to set one loaf of fresh baked bread at each end of the table.   Everyone who has seen it has been impressed.  What's great too is many times in the evening I will make a loaf for lunches the next morning.  It's so quick.   I have noticed that my loaf always rises nice and big if I warm my liquid to at least room temperature (or a little more) first.  I have experimented, and the only times my loaf has been a little smaller was when I left my liquid at refrigerator temperature and made my bread.   Fresh bread is always the best bread and with this breadmaker I rarely ever have any left over...but it's only 45 minutes to another fresh loaf. "

kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,"Great, but...","I needed a saucepan to cook oatmeal in that would let go on the bits that stick to the bottom.  Sounds silly, but I love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards.  This cleans up easily and cooks evenly.  I have used it for cooking rice, gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well.  Now, for the lid.  There is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently.  I sat down, wrote an email to the company and by the next day, they have a new lid on the way.  They asked only where to send it, nothing else.  I like companies that stand by the product they sell.  So, if you are going to buy from this line, check that black band, it should be between the glass and the metal, not on the inside of the lid.  If you have a problem with the product, ALWAYS notify the manufacturer, they will almost always make it right, like Calphalon did for me"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,2.0,Poor design,"This silicone pan's fluted sides are far too ""pointy"", for lack of a better word.  The part of the cake in the narrow ""points"" cooks MUCH faster than the rest of the cake, leaving you with burned, or over-cooked edges.  My other problem may be common to all silicone bakeware, but this pan doesn't brown cakes, it simply heats them, leaving you with a somewhat mushy and pale cake exterior, especially around the inner tube.  I'm going back to a metal bundt pan"

It was about the size of a breadbox.  Well, this is just SLIGHTLY bigger, and WAY better.  Let me put it this way, my kids spilled 1/2 gallon (yes, half a gallon) of Sherwin Williams Cashmere flat enamel on my new carpet. (latex paint) I was MORTIFIED!  My neighbor, who, blessedly, happened to be there at the time, said, ""Do you have a steam cleaner?""  I replied, ""No, just a foam shampooer, not an extractor.""  He ran next door, and handed me his ""Little Green"".  I was so freaked about the stain, I just dug in and started sucking with this little thing, with no regard to what paint would do to it. (Nice neighbor I AM??!) Anyway, it got out EVERY BIT.  I had to empty the tank a few times, but come on! It was HALF A GALLON OF PAINT~!  Anyway, the paint DID stain the inside of the brush head and the dirty tank, but it didn't slow it down a bit.  As a courtesy, I traded the affected pieces with parts from a new unit, and have already used it 3 times in the last month.  Praise God for this little wonder. (And the neighbor!!)BUY IT, QUICK!

Giant paper muffin cups might help, but I'm buying new metal pans.  If you care about taste, stay away from these"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 5,1.0,Do not waste your time with this product,"I bought one of these about a year ago. When I brought it home it sealed 2 bags then stopped working.  I called the company and they said to take it back to the store.  I assumed it was just an extreme case so I exchanged it for the same product.  Within the first year of having it, the wire that seals the bags has burned through it's protective coating. So now whenever I seal a bag it burns a hole in it, which then lets air into the bag, defeating the whole purpose of the machine.  I wrote the company and asked if there was something I could do or a part I could buy, I was told that they don't sell that part and that since it had been a year there was nothing they could do.  I do not recommend this product, it's cheap and the Rival customer service is definitely lacking"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 21,5.0,BETTER THAN EXPECTED !!!,"MY REGULAR OVEN MALFUNCTIONED JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAY SEASON. I PURCHASED THIS HAMILTON BEACH COUNTERTOP CONVECTION OVEN OUT OF DESPERATION. I AM ADDING ANOTHER 5-STAR RATING FOR THIS SMALL APPLIANCE BECAUSE OF IT'S GENEROUSLY-SIZED OVEN CAPACITY, EASE OF USAGE, CONSISTENT HEAT DISTRIBUTION, AND EXCELLENT VALUE. I USED BOTH THE BAKE MODE AND THE CONVECTION MODE THUS FAR. THE BAKE MODE WAS USED FOR BAKING BROWNIES IN AN 8X8X2"" PAN. THE BROWNIES WERE EVENLY COOKED AND PERFECTLY CRUSTED WITH NO OVER-DRYNESS. THE CONVECTION MODE WAS USED FOR A ROAST TURKEY BREAST WHICH RESULTED IN AN IMPRESSIVE UNIFORM BROWNING TO THE SKIN WITH NO OVER-BROWNING OR DRYNESS TO THE MEAT. THE OVEN'S TEMPERATURE GAUGE ENSURES AN ACCURATE INTERNAL OVEN TEMPERATURE AND THE AIR FLOW OF THE CONVECTION OPTION ENSURES EVEN COOKING WHILE SIMULTATEOUSLY SAVING TIME (GREAT FOR ROASTS OR WHEN TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE FOR ENTERTAINING.) I HAVE THIS CONVECTION SITTING ATOP OF MY MICROWAVE OVEN. IT DISPLAYS WELL BECAUSE OF ITS SIMPLE BLACK WITH CHROME ACCENT DESIGNS. BUY THIS ITEM CONFIDENTLY"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,5.0,An Essential for Family of Four or More,"This is a big saucepan!  I got it for Christmas because I needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines.  This has become my favorite pot for many things; from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night.  The see-through lid is great for monitoring food as it's cooking, and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring.  It is traditional Calphalon quality with a modern look, and I love it"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,4.0,Nice cooking piece and serving,It's great to cook and serve in one dish. We even store the leftovers right in the casserole. Just remember to tell the kids it's hot when it comes out of the oven. Dishwasher safe
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Looks Great;,"This a fine House Piece that really jazzed up my living room.  The chairs consumed the most time, as they took about an Hour to put together.  Never the less, the finished product was rewarding.  Shipping was timely and I was satisfied. "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Second Time Around,"I mourned the death, after five years of excellent service, of my lovely little ""Just for Dinner"" West Bend bread machine that baked a loaf in only 45 minutes. When gifted with the Cuisinart, I eyed it warily. Too complicated, takes too long, etc.  Well, I have been pleasantly surprised. This machine has baked many loaves, usually in an hour when I set it on ""Last Minute Loaf."" It also makes a lovely Artisan Bread and has produced lots of pizza dough (in ten minutes when set on Last Minute Loaf and removed at the beep). I like the feature that tells you when to remove the paddle, so the loaf doesn't have a big hole. I still haven't exhausted all the possibilites. I do wish the booklet had been put together all the same side up. It's hard enough to flip thru pages without having to keep turning it around. All in all, I am very happy with my new Cuisinart Convection Automatic Bread Maker"

That said, OXO has great customer service and other products I've used are better"
kitchen & housewares,19 of 20,5.0,Excellent skillet,"This is a great piece for the kitchen. We've cooked all kinds of things in it and it doesn't cease to impress us.  The handle does get hot, but Le Creuset makes heat pads for the handles so this isn't an issue (just be sure not to get it too close to the flame if you're cooking on a gas stove). Though not non-stick, it's easy to clean and always looks great.  Don't hesitate on buying this item"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Excellent,"This is the latest in a long line of trying out popcorn poppers.  Hot air and microwave make bad popcorn, tasteless and tough.  This one makes good tasting popcorn.  I use 1/4 C. of popcorn, 2 T of butter and about a half tsp. of salt.  It popped all but five kernels. The search is over."

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Very good wok.,I bought it last year and is very satisfied with this wok. It is big enough for basically any family size dish. It is pretty heavy and sits on the stove steadily. 
kitchen & housewares,4 of 7,4.0,This mixer is great!,"I've just started using my mixer.  I've made bread, rolls, doughnuts and banana bread.  The mixer works well especially for yeast doughs.  The dough is well mixed and require a small time for hand kneading.  I highly recommend this product"

kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,4.0,Does a great job!,"I only use this to marinade meats for short periods of time.  I save money because I'm not having to but the most tender cuts of meat and still get very tender steaks.  I haven't had problems with the container holding the vacuum seal, then again I don't keep food in the canister longer than an hour. I've been washing the bottom of the container in the dishwasher and haven't noticed any damage after many, many washings.  If I could change it a little bit, I would like to have a longer container.  I marinade really thick london broils and sometimes they are hard to fit inside a 9 1/2 sq. inch container.  "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,Great machine--except for one safety feature!,"For the most part, I like this machine. It was the one I wanted and it does what I need it to do and I like that (I've never made dough in it, so cannot comment on that feature, which seems to be where people have issues with it). "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,"Great Price, attractive, good value for the money",Yes this set is a little heavy but no more sliding around the table either.  Makes a difference at my table. I purchased two sets
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,5.0,For those who don't like to cook...,"I don't like to cook.  I don't even like to do outside barbeques!  But The George Foreman Grill is kind of cramping my style - I'm having fun using it.  It's easy to use, grills fast, cleans easily and quickly, and gives meats a really great taste.  My wife gets home late from work and then cooks dinner for us (I know, I'm heartless - but, like I said, I hate cooking) so I've cooked some meats in minutes when she gets home.  All that's left is to do some salad or veggies and our healthy meal is done being made in 15 minutes."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 23,1.0,I HATE this pan,"My mom bought me this pan for Christmas a few years ago and I absolutely hate it.  It's the worst pan I've ever owned.  Food sticks to it no matter how much oil or how low of heat I cook on.  It is not balanced properly and I find it difficult to manage when full of food.  The handle is too narrow and it makes it so you can't lift the pan with one hand.  My husband used it the other night and ended up bruising his hand with the handle.  Because the handle is hollowed out in the middle, all of the pressure is on the two points of contact that meet the hand.  He can't even use his hand today.   This pan went out in today's garbage.  I wish my mom had saved her money"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Don't press too hard!!,"A lot of people have been giving this grater bad reviews.  It works very well for me.  I grate cheese with it for my macaroni and cheese, and other pasta dishes.  We are used to holding and pushing very hard with the cheese in the traditional grating process.  The trick to this one is to NOT PUSH TOO HARD.  The grater is very very sharp and will do the work for you if you get the technique down pat.  Hold it lightly against the grater, and it will grate just fine.  Battery power is fine for me, never slows down. Maybe the grater body could be a little wider so the cheese would come down easier, but there is even a technique for that which works, bang it on the side of your hand, or use a table knife to push it out.  I guess I kind of like gadgets, and since this one works.  I can't see why it is being dissed so badly.  Come on lighten up!!!"
kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,5.0,Very convenient and easy to use,"This is a good one. Large buttons help operate easily. Size of Numbers is about 1/2 inch for each time display. The audible alert is pleasant to hear. Loud enough for within the room use or nearby. I read the previous reviews and bought this one. I use it for timing practice tests for my kids. Easy directions and pretty sturdy. I use it on a table top, so I have no idea how strong the magent is. Worth the money"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great Muffin Pan!,"I love this muffin pan! There is no need to grease it, and the muffins come out beautifully - nothing sticks! "
kitchen & housewares,7 of 10,5.0,Great Value,"I have purchased three (3) of these for myself and friends; it is perfect for useing with pre-packaged stir-fry mixes or make/modify your own. Just start the rice cooker, wait 15 mins., heat up the wok and go-to-it. (P.S...I paid $19.99 each so watch for sales"

It is a very attractive hard floor with a rough shale looking finish."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,4.0,Works Well,"It works well.  Cleans up easy.  Retractable cord is cool.  Some reviews mention that it makes a mess (water boiling over and out), but I have not experienced that.  I don't usually cook more than 1 or 2 cups (dry measurement) of rice at a time, maybe that's the difference"

kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent,I bought this to replace a Cuisinart that was recalled. It has reliably been making excellent coffee for nearly a year. No problem in using #4 filters.  Thermal carafe keeps coffee nice and hot. Great product
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"heavy, but functional","As far as I know, (I have the 10 1/4"" and 12"" equivalents of this lid as well), the 12"" lid is the only one that has little flanges (?) that cover the spout portion of the corresponding skillet.  So less steam will escape.  This lid does not have those flanges, so steam will escape from the spouts.  Also, the resulting hole will let dust/flies in."
kitchen & housewares,20 of 21,4.0,Cuisinart Grill & Griddle,Received this as a gift.  Works great!  Steaks cook up perfectly; not quite like char-broiled but darn close.  Pancakes are a breeze.  Brats need to be covered by a pot lid while cooking lest they burn and take forever to thoroughly cook.
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,             Sassafras Wood Pizza/Bread Peel,    My husband bought a Pizza Stone for my Christmas gift..I was so happy but I didn't receive the peel to go with it..I was disappointed..so I started searching the Internet for one..Amazon is my favorite place to shop and low and behold  I found the perfect peel!!! I'm so happy..Thank you Amazon !!!
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great price for these rolls,"You can't beat this price for these rolls. If you own the machine, you'll want more of the bags to seal and store, for sure. This is the best price I could find on this product"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,found a hot pack source,"Like others, the hot/cold pack opened up in the microwave and is not useable.I found a company named Roshgo Corporation that makes temperature control products.  They sell an item called REACTRO that is a reuable hot gel pack.  They also sell one called FREEZEZE which is a gel ice pack refrigerant.  You can call toll free-  1-888-4-ROSHGO.  They are out of Alpharetta, GA. The product is great if you can get the packs to work"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,"A great plate, but don't get it confused!","That said, Fiesta also makes a plate called the bread plate which I thought was the normal size of a saucer.  If you're looking for a normal sized saucer, then this is it - not the bread plate.  It is 1 inch smaller than this plate.  Otherwise, these are just great plates, look fantastic in your kitchen, and are so much fun mixing and matching the colors.  They don't hold up well to knife marks, but oh well.  They sure are pretty on the table! That's my only complaint with these plates and I highly recommend them"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,The best,"I simply love Le Creuset's entire line of items, and this soup pot is no exception.  it is the perfect size for curries, soups, and sauces, and clean-up is almost a pleasure.  if you price this cookware anywhere else, you'll quickly recognize what a great deal amazon offers.  i'll keep using amazon to add to my collection"
kitchen & housewares,24 of 25,5.0,"High quality unit, affordable price, great espresso","This was the best price point I could find for a super-automatic espresso maker.  It was also among the most highly rated by other customers.  The unit has been great!  I've had it for 4 months.  My friends are always amazed by the quality of the espresso and they all want one of these machines too, now."

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Love the board, hate the packaging!","I absolutely love this cutting board.  It works well with most knives (don't use the serrated knives with tiny teeth).  The board is very forgiving with repeated cutting.  They are very heavy and very attractive.  The only complaint I have is the paper packaging stuck to the board.  I've bought 3 of these and I couldn't get all of the ""glue"" off any of the boards.  I eventually just put the oil on the boards to protect them and that somehow helped get most of the sticky residue off.  MIU France really needs to use something that will not permanently stick to the boards.  I'd give it a 5 star if the sticky residue and paper came off easily"

kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,4.0,Beautiful tableware,"I looked for some time for new dishes to go with my redecorated kitchen, and the Pistoulet dishes are perfect.  They're sturdy, they stand up to the microwave and dishwasher and they're whimsically pretty, all at once.  I do wish that the standard coffee cups (instead of mugs) were included, and a three-piece place setting seems skimpy.  (Most china settings are five pieces: dinner plate, salad plate, bowl, cup and saucer.)  This is the reason for the 4-star rating.  If bowls were included in a place-setting, it would get all 5 stars"

I originally bought the (much) cheaper two-stage Chef's Choice sharpener which was great for quickly and accurately honing cheap kitchen knives. I've even used it on machettes, anything with a flat grind can be sharpened with these things..."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This Spiral Slicer is Awesome!!!,"I love using this to make zuccini noodles with marinara sauce or buttered creamed sauce made from pine nuts and cold pressed olive oil! This spiral slicer is extremely easy to use and I like the fact that I am using my bodies energy instead of electricity!!! I highly recommend this to all of my friends who are interested in making ""noodles"" from vegetables instead of processed wheat which is harder for your body to digest. Enjoy and be creative!!! "
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,"FINALLY A TRUE ""SLOW"" COOKER","After trying (and returning) several slow cookers which both overcooked the food on low heat, I purchased this West Bend 84765 model.  Put together some potatoes, chicken thighs, broccoli, carrots, etc.  Left on LOW for 10 hours....vegetables were juicy and flavorsome...chicken was fall-off-the-bone moist.  This is the way a slow cooker should cook....everything should turn out tender and juicy.  Thanks for all of your opinions on this site, which convinced me to purchase this wonderful slow cooker"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,Horrible Service and Warranty Issues,"Manual machines, without question,produce the best cup of espresso.  I have owned them in the past, and recently purchased a brand new La Pavoni.  The machine arrived broken.  I could not even get one cup of espresso.  I called thinking that La Pavoni would have me send back the machine and replace it. WRONG.  I was told that this was not allowed, and the only option I had was contact one of there US Service Agents and arrange to have the machine sent to them for repair. Even then they indicated that the repair expense would be my responsibility.  "
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,2.0,Good kitchen timer - not for all purposes,"I purchased to use in the classroom, however it beeps whenever you press a button.  For example, to to set the timer for 10 minutes it beeps 11 times - once for each minute, and once when you press the start button.  Very annoying, and no way to shut off the volume.  This would be great in the kitchen"

We all love the Fiestaware dishes - they are beautiful and hold up well!

They are heavy and substantial ceramic.  They are quite beautiful, and I can't believe they are selling them for only 15.99.  The red is an absolutely beautiful shade. I am very impressed with these bowls"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,"A great tool, only one tiny detail","I feel the scoop is just a tad too big. I had another mellon baller, just as good as the KitchenAid, but the balls were smaller and just so cute. Still, it's a great tool and can help in so many ways, not just cantaloupe, but cheeses, cucumbers, and other fruits! "
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Still thrilled one year later.,"After much research, I settled on this Oster blender for my kitchen. I use it frequently for smoothies (with ice), for cold and hot soups, and even to blend nuts into flour. It has proved to be a great product - just as good as my mother's Waring, but half the price."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Gorgeous Sconce,"Before I ordered this piece I read all of the other reviews on it. I completely agree with everyone. It is a beautiful piece and was worth every penny. The shipping was very fast, I received it within a week of ordering. I ordered on a Thursday and it was at my door waiting for me the following Wednesday. It was packaged very well with each votive wrapped individually in a small box. If you are ordering this as a gift for someone, beware that it arrives in the original box showing exactly what you are getting with a big picture of it on the front. I still can't believe how inexpensive it was. You can't find quality things like this piece for so little money."
kitchen & housewares,10 of 10,1.0,Poor Design,"Very disappointed Kitchenaid fan. This spatula is not only way WAY too large to be useful and poorly balanced, but also it's sister product (the short turner) broke recently when dealt some routine cooking abuse. Snapped right at that pretty narrow neck. Futhermore, the plastic handles are not heatproof like the silcone, so if you leave it leaning on the pan or the stove, it will melt. What's the point of silcone then"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 2,5.0,Great price and great quality,"These pans arrived quickly, and are a solid, nice size item.  Great for small meals, particularly if you are cooking for one.  Great price for 3 pans!!"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,A great choice.,"I have worked with different mixers in the past, but this is the first mixer I have bought for myself.  I did some research before I plunked down the money for a mixer, and I knew that I wanted one with a powerful motor and with staying power.  I have watched my mother go through mixer after mixer before she stayed with Kenwood (now DeLonghi, of course).  She has had her mixer for a few years now, and she has used it regularly on a weekly basis without problem.  Initially, I was planning to go for a Viking mixer, but the price at the time was a little dear.  I pounced on this mixer when I was able to get it for just under $300 on Amazon (I took advantage of a lot of discounts and gift certificates!)  I do not regret this purchase in the least.  I am an avid baker, and this machine has not failed me.  Initially, I was concerned about the stability; when I toyed with the controls, it shook a little across the counter at the highest speed while kneading bread.  However, I think it might have been an isolated incident, for I haven't noticed it again since.  Also, I seldom have the need to bring the speed up that high.  The bowl is nice and deep, which I find also helps minimize the flinging of flour into a cloud.  When I purchased it, I was also able to get a grain mill for free, which was handy in grinding my own wheat flour and cornmeal."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Great urn...and new top!,"I just wanted people to know that it looks like Melitta has replaced the glass knob with a plastic knob.  Obviously from the reviews the glass knob was a problem.  There isn't a problem with the plastic one..but it is ugly.  It does not fit with the overall good look of the coffee urn.  If I was buying this to sit on my table - I would think twice.  But, it sits on a counter and I'm not concerned.  But, at least I know it won't break.  Besides that ...the urn works great"
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,1.0,Crap,The Block is of very poor quality and is Damaged and put together very poorly. I do not recomend buying this product.

kitchen & housewares,12 of 14,1.0,slicer is terrible!,This slicer is not even worth the $10 I paid for it.

Don't buy this item it is very dangerous! 
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,fantastic,"Fiestaware items are objects of beauty that I have found to be virtually indestructible.

And what fantastic colors for food presentation.."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,This vacuum really sucks!!! ,"Don't be alarmed looking at the title. We wanted a vacuum cleaner that can really suck everything on its way and this one does exactly that. Looking at the price (&lt;$50 thanksgiving sale) I was a bit skeptical about performance but came home and tested it out right away... This one rocks! Best one I have used in my life. Highly recommend. Very easy to use, only drawback?? - the cord is about 12 foot so if you are using on a bigger room, you may have to switch plug points -but thats true to most vacuums anyways. Good buy"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,"Uncomplicated, exactly as advertised","My wife wanted this for very simple tasks in her Thai restaurant. She opened the box, wiped/washed the vessel clean, dumped in some garlic and fresh chilis, and hit Play. It worked like a charm, and is still doing it a month later, heavy-duty, even though it is not specifically rated for such commercial work. It is precisely what she wanted, and does exactly the task it says it does. There are no drawbacks, actually, but I give 4 out of 5 because - be careful washing this little baby, the blades (surprise!) are sharp."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Super multiclad cookware at a reasonable price.,"This cookware overall is an excellent choice for the price.  It heats uniformally cleans up well and looks great, I have them hanging on a pot rack in the kitchen.  The handles do well on heat they don't get to hot unless they have been on the burner for an extended period of time but I've used more expensive pots that heat up much faster.  If I have a complaint it's that they haven't expanded the line at all.  I'd like to see more choices in the multiclad like like they have in their other sets"

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best Ever!!,"If you like ice cream in a bowl, this is the best spade ever designed!  Works like a hot knife through butter.  The tephlon coating performs wonderfully, just as you would expect.  I am an ice cream addict, and have found this to be the best scoop of any I have tried.  This is the first amazon review I've written.  I shop here but never rate stuff.  This deserves a perfect 5!!  Amazing product"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 6,1.0,Don't waste your money!,"I thought ""KitchenAid"" this has to be a keeper. I was wrong. The handles are much too heavy. There's too much give with the spatulas.

kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,2.0,These are kind of cheesy,I bought these because they look beautiful in the picture.  I returned them because the glass was thick and not that evenly molded.  They just had a cheap feel to them and my wife hated them too

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great Coffee Press,"I find myself getting excited about a good cup of strong coffee.   I have found a French press to be a great way to accomplish a good cup at home.  I have had several different kinds of presses over the years.  This is the best I've ever owned.  I have been using for several months and just love it.  The press itself fits tight and works great.  The fact that it is a thermal carafe is very helpful.  I prime it with a little boiling water and it keeps coffee warm for several hours.  It is easy to clean.  So far, it has been very durable.  I have broken every glass press I've owned.   I can't seem to break this one.  Pricey but worth it.  I would purchase this same model/brand again."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Another great value from ALL-CLAD,"I had never heard of ALL-CLAD products until my brother-in-law (of all people--he hates to cook) purchased a set of cookware that was on sale. When I saw it in his kitchen, I thought it looked so good, I picked up this saucepan (I'm forever making sauces). It was one of the best purchases, kitchenwise, I'd made in a while. It has the two qualities that all cooks demand: it's easy to clean and it's durable. The lid sits firmly and snugly"
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,The Best Bread Machine I Have Owned,"I am really disappointed to see so many bad reviews for this machine.  It is without doubt one of the most unattractive appliances I own, but it produces the best quality machine baked bread I have ever produced.  "

kitchen & housewares,29 of 29,5.0,"Weird, But Good","I just made some banana bread in the silicone rubber loaf pan.  It was a really weird experience.  The loaf pan is a soft rubber and doesn't feel structural enough to bake anything.  There are two main advantages.  1) Nothing sticks to silicone rubber.  2) The silicone rubber loaf pan is so flexible I could probably turn it inside out, and that makes it easy to remove baked items."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 5,1.0,Unique features in a bad product with lousy service resolution.,"I bought a Panasonic toaster oven and I am now planning to return what I have. My first unit worked fine for about 4 months and then the rack mechanism broke followed by the heating element at the bottom. I had to send the unit for repair and then (weeks later) was accused of abusing the unit by the servicer, who then claimed an out of warranty problem and refused to repair it. Weeks later, Panasonic sent me a replacement - but the wrong model; more weeks later, I received the right model but it was damagaed upon unpacking it. It's been three months and I still don't have resolution or a toaster oven, not to mention all the time I've spent on the phone with Panasonic - where some folks are very helpful and some are worthless (outsourcing at its best). I cannot recommend this product and for me, the Panasonic brand is tainted"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,A better handle.,"Have had this fry pan for several years and never gave the handle a second thougt.  Recently until I needed a none stick pan to use with an induction hob.  Since I think all non-stick is temporary (at least with the way I cook), price is a major consideration.  Ended up buying an inexpense commercial fry pan that had an oval tubed handle.  Was surprised to find the oval gives better control than the thin All-Clad handle and without becoming too hot."

Without instructions to be found, we figured out what it was and how to use it. How wonderful!!! Fresh, spiral sliced pineapple in seconds. I didn't cut too deeply into the shell so it would hold liquid. I froze the shell and used it later as a drink container.  Since it was frozen, the shell was like a mini ice cream freezer.  The drink started to get slushy.  Yum,Yum!! Once home, I located the set of 3 at Amazon.com-myGearstore. I use the med. blade most.  What fun we have had"
kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Makes terrific Ice Cream!!!,I have thoroughly enjoyed using this Ice Cream maker!!! It's very simple to use and I don't have to worry about forgetting to put something in the freezer beforehand or fool with salt and ice. I've used many different types and this one is by far the easiest to use and makes great ice cream. We've been experimenting with different recipes (from books and the internet). I would highly recommend this unit. (I had read it was pretty noisy but I don't find it that bad.....I bought a soy milk maker some years ago and it will run you out of the house with it's noise.
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,The Best Deep Fryer Out There!!!!!,I received this deep fryer for Christmas and it does a great job. It is so easy to clean and the best part is all of it can go in the dishwasher. I was a little concerned at first because it started smoking as it heated up but it was the first time use and it was supposed to do that. I would recommend this to everyone
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO!,"I love this item. Perfect for storing Pet Food. Special Screw type tops that seals food.  Bugs, Mice Cannot get in.  Easy to wash, let it air dry.  My only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it.  So those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed.  Over all the best in Food Storage.  I know i just about bought them all"

This cool tool makes converting recipes, whether downsizing or cooking for a huge crew, a breeze - it does all the converting for you!  The directions are pretty simple, though I keep my user's guide handy for a refresher from time to time.  The protective keypad cover is a must in the kitchen, keeping it clean.  I love the tilting display, the ease of use, and this cuts out the headache and pencil & paper converting to about a minute!  It even has a ""pinch"" and ""dash"", C & F, metric and English measurement choices.  All it takes is just a few entries and the calculator does all the hard work. It couldn't be any easier!   My kids love it also! I don't use the duo timer very often, but am glad it's there. "

Upon trying to use this item for the first time the motor barely had enough power to cut a tomato and emitted a burning smell as soon as I turned it on... Unmentioned on the web page is the 10 minute duty cycle, an important piece of information that would have been a big help in deciding wether to purchase this item.."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 3,2.0,How can it be a Pro when it Breaks in two weeks?,"At First I thought this was a great blender, however in two weeks of use the blade stopped turning. I do not have enough faith in the blender to keep it, so I am returning it."

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,I really like it!,"I bought this in a store recently as I didn't have time to wait for it to ship, and had only two choices -- this one, which at least looked solid, and a plastic one.  I was a little worried about buying this particular version, because I had read the (sometimes terrible) reviews, but being an optimist decided I would give it a try -- also, the cookies sounded so yummy! "
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Puppies love 'em!!!,"I had one of these beds for our older dog already.  I purchased this one for my younger and bigger dog.  They fit perfectly in their kennels and are a breeze to clean!  Just throw them in the washer then transfer to the dryer.  If my dogs are ever without their beds, as soon as they're back in the kennels, the dogs run and lay down on them!  They're fairly durable (took a couple of weeks to teach the older dog that the bed isn't a toy) and really soft!  I highly reccomend them"

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,5.0,Well made and a joy to use..........,"This is a perfect size for two people and the one I have is in such a gorgeous colour of blue.  We like it because we can make a two person serving of scalloped potatoes, two pieces of lemon salmon or two almond chicken breasts.  For one person you can actually make a piece of meat/fish along with two servings of vegetables and cover with foil and freeze for a quick microwave meal.  In fact I am going to get three more of them just for planning ahead heat and eat meals"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,VillaWare Ravioli Maker,"I bought this to use with the KA pasta roller attachment. My ravioli have been perfect. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem sharp enough to easily cut the ravioli. I go over and over with my rolling pin and still have to do final cutting with my pizza wheel. If not for this, it would be 5 stars plus"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,1.0,A total disappointment,"I had another Oster Breadbaker before this one, and I just loved it. I don't recall that I ever had a failure with it. After I started having trouble with the belt breaking in the old one, I decided to go with another Oster, and I have been totally disappointed with it. The flour doesn't mix in from the corners of the pans. The crust has been so hard you can break a tooth on it. And sometimes the bread rises and sometimes it doesn't. It seems to me that either the recipes are faulty--in which case the Oster test kitchens need to get back to work--or the machine is poorly designed. I sent an e-mail message to Sunbeam Customer Service about ten days ago, and even though they replied that I'd hear again from them within 48 hours, I haven't heard a peep. I cannot in good conscience recommend either this bread machine or the company that makes it"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Great little machine!,"It's perfect for your car, stairs, area rugs and furniture! I really enjoy this little machine! it's lightweight, compact, long power cord. it's a must have if you have pets or children"

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,It needs a top!,"I *love* this grill but it needs a top to hold in heat and to make it cook faster.  We have used it grill everything from chicken to fish and it does a very good job.  The surface is big enough to hold several pieces of meat to feed a family of four.  It really needs a top though, and if you can tolerate the smoke in your kitchen and imagine that it's the smell of an outdoor barbeque, you'll love the gril"

True high quality blanket at a dimestore price (these are Macys Charter Club clearance items),"Well, I've been burned several times in the past year by ""too good to be true"" blowouts on Amazon, so I entered this deal with a great amount of skepticism. Would these blankets be paper thin? Or would they pill unmercilessly in the wash? Or would they feel like sandpaper? Or...? The price was so right, I figured the quality would be all wrong. "

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Big enough to not need the $40 giant version from Golda's,"After several years, this was on sale for $17.99 so I finally made the leap and this makes cleaning sandy Chinese greens much less stressful and wastes less water. This product should be marketed to the Chinese diaspora.  Frankly, everyone in Asia needs to be introduced to this product.  I don't use it as much as I would like because I don't eat as many vegetables as I ought to do."

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,You get what you pay for.,"It is worth the money.  It grinds the beans into consistently-sized particles, unlike my old grinder.  It is easy-to-use.  Mine is over two years old and has been trouble-free.  As far as some others' comments about the noise, it is a coffee grinder, so it is not going to as be quiet as a toaster.  My old grinder was also noisy, except that it made a very annoying high-pitched noise.  Static electric charge is almost non-existent.  Its rectangular shape requires miminal counter space."
kitchen & housewares,7 of 8,1.0,temperature settings don't work,"Had high hopes for this slow cooker based on Amazon reviews, but based on my first attempt (buffalo stew) this device should be renamed ""fast cooker"".  All four temperature settings resulted in overcooking.  Even at the ""keep warm"" setting the stew continued to boil, so the stew turned into mush.  Don't buy it"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,My Calphalon skillets are getting dusty.......,"This set of skillets were my first ever Circulon pieces, and I am thrilled with their performance!

kitchen & housewares,8 of 9,5.0,A Great Little Waffle Iron !,"This one is for when a pair of Belgian waffles will do and you have very limited appliance storage space. It works great with precise temperature control and it even beeps when the waffle is done. If you've made your batter right, you can't make a bad waffle with this iron. Another plus is its ""retro"" styling. It's very pleasing to the eye. It's a Cuisinart "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 3,5.0,Presto 06841 Professional Electric Skillet and Server,"To tell you the truth I have never had this brand of Electric skillet nor have I had a professional brand, even though I have just purchased this electric skillet and have not really had a chance to see it's performance over the long haul but so far the few times I have used it, I have had no problems and I can say it is fast and heats up almost instantly. Does not burn or scorch the food and is a breeze to clean even easier than my Westbend electric skillet with a teflon interior, this Presto brand seems quite sturdy, handles are strong has a nice big handle on top of lid which is nice to hold. Skillet is heavy for heavy duty aluminum which is a very good feature and don't find that kind of quality in electric skillets nowadays, at this point I can tell you I am very happy with the purchase of this skillet and it far outweighed my expectations of the Presto brand. Even though I did not price this skillet anywhere else I believe I paid a lower price than I would have paid in the brick and mortar stores, Sure Source which was the seller of this skillet I might add was fast and my Skillet arrived in tact and working. If you want to purchase a brand that meets the sturdiness and versatility that this brand seems to offer then I would recommend this Professional style Skillet which also doubles as a server"
kitchen & housewares,12 of 12,5.0,So this is Stainless Steel Flatware?,The product exceeded my expectations.  The fabulous shine of the stainless steel flatware could be compared to actual silverware. I chose the Oneida set because I liked the American Harmony design -- I never expected that the quality of the product would be my ultimate satisfaction.  It is obvious the workmanship put into this product will result in many years of usage.  I purchased the 53 piece set and received the 20 piece set as a bonus.  I also took advantage of the free shipping -- What a bargain!  What a steal

kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Light and convenient! I love it!,"I got this as a Christmas gift and I don't know how I lived without it! I'm in a townhouse with three levels, 2500+ square feet, hardwoods and carpet, plus a dog and a cat. The Shark works great in a pinch when I don't have time to deal with a big bulky vacuum. Vacuums as easily on carpet as hardwood or tile and it really picks up a lot of stuff! Its so light that I don't get exhausted vacuuming and carrying it from one floor to another. Also, its better than a dust-buster, because it picks up dog hair too (powerful spinning brush in the Shark). Easy to assemble, did it myself in about a minute. There is no bag, but a rather large tray that empties easily. "

kitchen & housewares,2 of 4,5.0,NICE BLENDER,This is a well made quality blender with a simple design that works great. The pitcher is thick glass and the base is wide and heavy so it doesnt move around. It has a rotating dial to make a selection and the center of the dial pushes in for the ice crushing speed. The box states that it makes great smoothies but we havn't made any yet. Overall it has a nice heavy duty feeling to the entire unit. By far the best blender that we have ever owned.
kitchen & housewares,,1.0,Not what I was looking for,"I recieved this and as soon as I opened the box knew it was not for me. The outside of the toaster looked as if someone had scratched it up with sand paper. It was not even a black anymore. As for how it worked I am not sure, I didn't even try it"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Amazing,Great product!...compact and clean well in dishwasher!
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,The best kitchen gadget you will ever buy,"I hesitated for a long time before I bought one of these. I mean, really - a grater is just a grater, right?  Wrong!  This thing is worlds better than the standard graters I'd been using all my life. It makes grating hard cheeses (i.e., parmesan) and spices (i.e., nutmeg) so much easier it's truly amazing. I love this thing and find more uses for it all the time. A quick rinse under running water is all it needs for most cleanup. And, it's much harder to grate your own fingers with this than the old box-grater. Highly recommended"

kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great set for the money,"We've used open stock from this set for years before buying a complete set.  They hold up very well. They heat fast and evenly. Handles do tend to get a little hot closer to the pan, under high flame. Wasn't a problem when we had a electric cooktop."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,4.0,Great Product.,This George Forman Grill is so easy to cook and clean.  I have had other earlier versions and they weren't as easy to clean.  This timer and temperature gauge is great.  It is worth the its weight in price alone in all the fat you don't cook in.

It's a good  buy"
kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Poor quality,My grandson wanted this for his birthday so i ordered the entire collection.  I could not believe the poor quality of the quilt and sheet set.

I would not recommend these to anyone

kitchen & housewares,,2.0,Disappointed with Past Bowl,"I am happy with the delivery and the packaging. The bowl looks like it is chipped on the bottom base but upon closer examination has proven to be areas that the paint and glaze did not adhere. The bowl looks chipped though. There is an area on the side of the rounded part of the bowl that is scuffed, as if sand paper was rubbed against the bowl. I am unhappy with the condition but I only paid $11.00 for it. I like the color, even though it doesn't appear professionally painted and glazed. I would opt for something different next time."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I am sad to say that this was a total waste of money. It worked GREAT the first two time I used it, then the third time the non-stick coating began peeling off. What a shame, because it actually made great tortillas..  but you can't eat teflon."
kitchen & housewares,6 of 6,5.0,Best machine in its class,"This is simply the best coffee machine in its price category. Yes, yes, I know some reviewers have carped about the fact that the pot has to be positioned ""just so"" in its holder, and that unless the black ""dot"" on the pour spout is precisely lined up, coffee spills all over.  So yes, they should color the dot red so it's easier to see, and make the housing for the pot itself a bit deeper so it fits snugly in place. But if you really, really love coffee, these are VERY MINOR annoyances -- after a few pots, you get the hang of it and know exactly how to position the pot and how to line up the spout. Thermal caraffe instead of a hot plate saves on electric and keeps the coffee hot and fresh for hours, and nicely warm well into the afternoon. Also, it brews coffee at precisely the right temp to bring out the best flavor, no matter what brand of coffee you use. And the design is cool.  Bravo Capresso! (I have their burr grinder, too, and it's a winner too."
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,There is nothing here not to like...,"Except, perhaps, for the list price, there is nothing to improve upon with these fine mixing bowls. I chanced across a set in a mustard colored hue not presently listed here and got a major discount... so I have nothing but praise for the set.  The ceramic is dense and solid, with a bell-like ring and a formidable resistance to chipping and cracking.  The glaze is smooth, easy to clean inside and out, and simply beautiful. And the three nesting sizes cover perfectly the full range a moderately sized family will need. Pyrex would work as well, perhaps, but in between uses, these Emile Henry bowls can be proudly kept in plain sight!"
kitchen & housewares,16 of 16,5.0,You can't beat Kitchenaid,"Now...although Amazon does show a slightly different model in their ad, and other reviewers had pointed this out, I went into this purchase with my eyes wide open.  I still thought that this was an exceptional price.  On top of that, I opened an Amazon Credit card account and got a $30.00 credit on my card for doing so, and in addition I also took advantage of the August ""$25.00 off a purchase of $125.00 or more"" promotion.  This made my grand total a mere $144 and change.  A note to the wise though, the checkout process will not let you do both offers at once because it sees them as both ""promotional"" offers (which they are not, one is a ""credit"" on your charge account and the other a ""promotional"").  You will need to call them at 1-800-201-7575.  Now on to the mixer, Kitchenaid is wonderful...this model is powerful and easy to use.  I love the fact that the bowl raises and lowers instead of the mixer tilting like in other models.  I have made bread, cookies, cakes and love the ease of adding ingredients while the mixer is moving (there is enough room).  I plan on asking for additional attachments for Christmas, it's my new toy.  The shipping was fast and customer service friendly! "
kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,Gorgeous Glass,"Cake stand is so impressive-lovely to display any type of pastry,or cake. Domed lid is high and very functional-tall enough to cover a large cake or large amount of pastry. It is versitile in the way that you can reverse the bottom and top to create a beautiful punch bowl or serving bowl for a bowl-type dessert. As a matter of fact, I was so impressed the day it came in I re-ordered 2 more-one for my mother and 1 for my aunt!! Until now we had never seen a square pedestal &amp; dome! You will not be dissapointed with this piece"
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,becomes indispensable after use,"A kind friend gave us these...for some very special occassion, I do not recall.  I was less than enthusiastic about them when I received them.  However, we find ourselves using them every time we open a bottle of white wine.  It's very convenient for getting your wine chilled quickly or keeping it chilled after opening, we use it mostly for keeping an open bottle cool.  Having two in the freezer at all time is very convenient for comparing two different bottles of wine.  Very light weight and compact to keep in the freezer.  I also use them as ice packs for my kids when they have a boo boo.  They can be cleaned with a clorox wipe.  I highly recommend them"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 9,5.0,Beau T ful,Great cookware.  I love the shape and look.  I feel like an expert chef even though I'm really a novice.  My husband is grateful

kitchen & housewares,10 of 30,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"This product is worthless. Advertised as a good product for ""blending up smoothies"" ... this only works if you don't use frozen berries. Who can afford to keep fresh berries on hand all the time?  We didn't know what was happening when we went through the first blender and had to get the blender piece replaced because the plastic disc behind the blade came loose and wouldn't even hold after my husband super-glued it, rendering the product unusable.  The replacement part did exactly the same thing.  We're now on our 3rd blender and have been advised by Kitchenaid not to blend anything frozen.  This makes the product entirely useless to us. If you're blending mashed potatoes I suppose this is the product for you."
kitchen & housewares,9 of 9,5.0,Powerful,"Living in Miami and experiencing Hurricanes frequently this fan becomes a necessity. After every hurricane there is usually no power for 7-14 days. This fan kept us cool and made it much more bearable to be inside the house with no power and 90 degree weather. Great Fan ,worth every penny..Im going to purchase a second one."
kitchen & housewares,8 of 8,5.0,Used daily in my kitchen,"I purchased the Zojirushi 3 liter dispensing pot, and it runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in my house. We drink tea constantly, and it is wonderful not to have to wait to boil water. The Zojirushi allows you to set the desired water temperature based on your needs (i.e. 175 for green/white teas, 195 for other teas, 205 for cooking). The unit is tall enough to fit even our tallest to-go cup under the dispensing spout."

kitchen & housewares,6 of 19,1.0,I do not like being lied to!,"I purchased this product line in a retail store. The packaging clearly states it is dishwasher safe. Then after you unpack it, and read that if you put it in the dishwasher you void the ten year warranty! Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this product"

kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,4.0,One little flaw,"Very good mill, but the direction of rotation of the grinder is the same direction as the same as that needed to open the fill port. You can open it and spill if not paying attention, or if too much vino has been consumed."

This powder will make your All-Clad cookware shine again. All in a fraction of the time without harming the finish; even a nylon scrubbing sponge will damage the finish as I learned the hard way. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,4.0,Fantastic set for the $$$,I just bought these and I have been very pleased with them.  There don't seem to be hot spots and stuff cooks very evenly. Handles and lids don't get hot and the pans clean up easily as well. My only complaint is that the flat lip on the saute pan makes it tricky to flip things - you just have to make sure the pan isn't too full or else stuff falls out. 
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Easy Cooking,I first seen the Taylor Wireless Thermometer on a cooking show thought it would be a useful accessery.

kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,Very nice,"It is big enough to work as a kitchen timer. The two timer feature is great. It is loud enough to use in another room. The required sequence of button pushes for resetting the timer is complicated. All in all, I would recommend it"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Item worked well,"This ice cream maker is exactly what I was looking for; we've only used it once, but it seems very sturdy and the ice cream was fabulous"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,"Good coffee maker, bad design....sort of","I purchased this coffee maker for my office and it makes great coffee, has charcol water filtration, a gold tone mesh coffee filter, and keeps the coffee hot for hours. The reason I gave it only four stars is that the design is densely packed to make the machine so small, that the grinder bay gets steam from the hot water, making the coffee grounds stick to the grinder cup and the blade. Washing it requires the grinder assembly, pot, gold mesh coffee filter-(if not using paper coffee filters) and the drip assembly to be washed thoroughly before each use. I've had no problem with the timer function as some other customers have, although this coffee maker will wake you up in the morning! Guaranteed! When the timer starts the machine grinding coffee, the beans sound like broken glass in a blender. After the initial grounds are prepared, it sounds like a 747 taking off with JATO-(Jet Assisted Take Off) bottles attached to the fuselage. Yes, if the coffee doesn't get your heart started, the onboard grinder function will! Still, its a good product from Cuisinart and very reasonably priced for what it does. "
kitchen & housewares,12 of 13,1.0,Disappointed!,"I received my blender/processor as a gift and I use it occasionally (especially for smoothies and mixed drinks). I was disappointed when the clutch assembly broke! I couldn't believe that Cuisinart doesn't have a durable piece sitting at the motor. I contacted Cuisinart and they said it's not possible to repair on your own--that brass piece needs to be removed by qualified personnel!  I'm so glad I ran into these reviews!  Anyhow, I compared my blender to my parents' (Oster brand), and they have a much durable design. I'll make sure I inspect any small appliance before I make a purchase! In this case, it was a gift so I can't complain. I'm going to purchase the clutch assembly as recommended by one of the viewers. The Cuisinart name doesn't always equal high quality."
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Practical and Pleasing,"I've used these to bake everything from a rump roast to Shepard's pie, and the are fantastic.  Nice and think porcelain meaning no burnt bottoms and a breeze to clean.  The large pot will hold a 6lb roast with no problems.  The smaller one is perfect for side dishes like green bean casserole or baked beans. Best part is they are pleasing to the eye and make a perfect serving dish...straight from the oven to the table"
kitchen & housewares,1 of 1,5.0,Bullet Proof Deep Fryer,Bought ours two years ago after considerable research. Busy working family with multiple schedules and a parade of hungry young adults have given it a workout. Not one problem yet.  Best one on the market as far as I am concerned. 
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Lovely dishes!,"I don't write reviews much, but i love these dishes (I have Sango Nova Blue)!  They are so beautiful and each one is slightly unique!  The coffee mugs are just the right size and the bowels are great!  They aren't too deep, but they're really wide.  I haven't had any of my dishes crack or chip and they seem to be quite durable in the microwave as well as in the dishwasher.  Of course, it's just my fiance and I using them, so i don't know how well they hold up in a family atmosphere, but they seem durable enough.  They are stoneware, so they'll obviously break and chip eventually.  Of course, they are a great price and it won't bust our student-budget if we have to buy a new set.  For us, they are absolutely perfect and delightfully gorgeous! "

kitchen & housewares,10 of 11,5.0,The last paring knife I'll ever buy,When you get the feeling that you can cut through anything and you end up using the product to do just that you know it's the best.   The knife was made to hold in my hand not someone elses.  I'm confident it won't slip.  I don't have to push and saw with this blade and I've used it as my general kitchen utility knife.  When it's dirty I don't have to baby it I just stick it in the dishwasher and it gets clean without me worrying about it getting damaged. I couldn't ask fo anything better and in a world where value is harder and harder to find this is a steal you can fall in love with

I love this knife, it is extremely sharp and makes cutting large quantities of food a dream. It is also well balanced and the handle fits my hand rather nicely. My husband loves the way the knife just &quot;sings&quot; as it is being pulled out of the block. The stainless steel is a very high quality"
kitchen & housewares,5 of 6,1.0,get something better,"I purchased this toaster, because I wanted something cheap and affordable.  I am going to buy something more expensive that actually works.  The Toastmaster only browns on one side and leaves the other side completely untoasted.  The crumb collector (that thing at the bottom of the toaster that collects all the crumbs--I forget the real name of it) doesn't work very well.  I have crumbs all over my counter all the time.  "
kitchen & housewares,33 of 34,1.0,Very dissapointed,"Can't believe the claimed $80 original price. My $5 pillow from walmart is much more comfortable than this. I was a little bit shocked when I first saw the slab of hard foam inside the pillow. Totally have no idea why people has such a 'stupid' design (Sorry, I have to use this word). I strongly suggest the designers use the pillow by themselves before they sell out the products. "

kitchen & housewares,0 of 1,1.0,This Cookie Press Needs to go back to the drawing board,"I bought this same machine at Target and had the same experience as everyone else that has submitted a review. I bought a Wilton thinking they knew what they were doing as they are the baking experts. Wrong. Someone needs to get fired or go back to the drawing board over this particular machine. I bought mine before Thanksgiving but just now opened it on Thursday, December 22 to make cookies for the first and last time with it. I am now just waiting for the holiday shopping crowds to die down so I can return it. My mother was helping and she added more milk to soften the dough which didn't work. The cookies that did come out were mishapen and we had to piece them together. I had a Hamilton Beach Battery operated cookie press that lasted 4 years using the same recipe the machine came with for Spritz cookies and never had a problem with power."
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,Wonderful little knife for the price!,"I must say, for the very reasonable price of this knife, she's a beaut.  GREAT handle...solid and comfortable to chop on and on.

kitchen & housewares,7 of 7,4.0,Iintrigue Blue is Country blue from the 80's,"I have only had this coffee maker a few days and I like how it works. It really does not drip when pouring. It has the three-prong plug in, auto shut off, and I have had no problems so far. The only thing I would like to point out is the color. I looked at several different web pictures of the Intrigue Blue color and none of them was a very good representation of the real color. I can best describe it as the ""country blue from the 1980's."" I know this color well because I had it in my kitchen back then. So I was disappointed in the color. I thought it looked like a brighter bolder shade of blue in the pictures than it really is. This looks to be a really well made coffeemaker and the warranty is for 3 years!"
kitchen & housewares,,4.0,"Yes, Its a Sweeper Not a Vacuum","I have two cats and recently had wood floors and tile installed in my entire condo. Was I surprised how much cat litter must have been hiding in my carpet. I got this sweeper to do quick pick ups during the week. It is light and easy to use - sure it does not pick up everything, but it gets more than a broom and dustpan or a swiffer. And, it is a lot easier than dragging out the vacuum every day. I love it, but I have only had it for 3 months. I will wait to see if it breaks down."
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Best value cookware set on the market!,"My wife and I purchased this set to replace ALL of our kitchen cookware that was lost/damaged in a recent move.  The performance is flawless.  Clean-up is a snap.  I don't understand the problems others are having with food sticking (if you food is sticking, I guarantee it's not the pan's fault).  The only thing that would take this set over the top is the addition of a non-stick for omelets and crepes and such.  I'd also recommend upgrading to the 5qt saute (you can only fit two bone-in pork chops at a time in the 3qt"

I use it when browning ground beef in a skillet to removing cake batter from the mixer bowl! I can't say enough about this fantastic spatula.  It is perfect!!"
kitchen & housewares,31 of 32,4.0,Well-made for what it's for,"It's important to realize that this grill pan won't heat up like your outdoor charcoal grill, retain heat like cast iron (le creuset or lodge), or even cook fish, chicken, and steak the same way as a gas grill. What this incredibly easy to use (both for cooking and cleaning) piece of kitchen ware is great for is finding that perfect balance for light grilling when you dont have the time or convenience to do it the old fashioned way."
kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,4.0,Nicely designed but watch for defects...,"My wife and I like these simple, easy to use noodle bowls. They're our favorite for eating rice and rice dishes. However, inspect your set carefully. Our first arrived with a cracked bowl, and the second arrived with spoons that were flawed. Once we had a good set, however, we found them to be keepers"
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,Great for short term,For longer term storage I always use the foodsaver canisters or the bags but these are great for slapping a quick cover on some left overs and having them stay fresh for the next few days
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Well-Made Product,"If you are in the market for a food mill, I highly recommend this one.  While it is a little more expensive than most, you are definitely getting a sturdy, high quality item.  I bought this one to make baby food and so far it has worked great.  Since it is so sturdy I will be able to use it for many years.  Also the threee different size discs are a great bonus. "
kitchen & housewares,4 of 4,5.0,Must-have if you want to bake your own GF french bread,"This is the second one that I have bought.  I've had the other for 7 or 8 years now, and it hasn't worn out, I've just misplaced it in my most recent move.  As Gluten-Free breads can be depended on NOT to hold any particular shape other than ""flat"" while rising and baking, if you miss French Bread and want to be able to bake it yourself, you need one of these.  It holds the shape, and allows even airflow around the loaves for a consistent crust.  A tip, though - put a layer of parchment paper between the bread and the pan, or you'll be working hard to pry the bread out of the perforations.  That shouldn't be a problem if you're baking normal bread, however"
kitchen & housewares,4 of 13,4.0,So far so good......,"I've only had this stuff for a couple weeks now & haven't tried it all, so this review (imho) isn't very worthwhile yet.  If I think about it I'll review it in a year! (ya, right :) )."
kitchen & housewares,2 of 2,5.0,Great way to fondue!,"This is a wonderful little appliance.  We have already used it and it was so easy to make fondue - you actually cook it in the pot, then just turn the heat down when it's done.  It keeps it at the perfect temperture and you don't have to worry about sterno (if you have an old fashioned pot you know what that is!) Did I mention you can throw it in the dishwasher and it's non-stick?  It's fabulous"

kitchen & housewares,6 of 7,4.0,Great Blender for Price,"I love not worrying about breaking the very heavy glass pitcher that most blenders come with. This blender has nice power and I love the ""Wavelogic"" for the smoothies we like to make. It really blends well and is very quiet compared to the previous ""old"" blender we had. Cleaning appears to be easier as well."
kitchen & housewares,,5.0,"Fast, Well-Designed, Excellent Quality","I own two of these kettles, one for the office and one for home, both acquired several years ago. I've also given several of these kettles as gifts. It's the best electric kettle I've come across, ever. It boils water very quickly, it looks sophisticated on the counter, and it's easy to clean. It's also very nice that the kettle lifts off the base (instead of having to be unplugged) and that there are no exposed elements inside the kettle. Definitely my favorite and longest lasting appliance"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,4.0,It's not that big,"I ordered this unit expecting it to be some behemoth based upon a few of the reviews here. I thought I would straighten out the size question. It is a quite reasonable size. It fits easily in my cabinet which is a standard size kitchen cabinet with 1 shelf. Also, it has been said a few times that it needs a huge amount of oil. I measured it. If I fill halfway between the min and max lines, it uses exactly 10 cups of oil. Not too bad. 12 cups would probably fill it to max. it's definitely less than a gallon."
kitchen & housewares,11 of 11,5.0,Love it!,"I purchased the 5.5 qt. LeCreuset oven after recommendations from Cooking Light, Cooks Illustrated and reading others' reviews.  I only wish that I would have purchased this great product sooner! I have been inspired to cook more and try new recipes.  I have also purchased the 2 qt size based on another suggestion, along with the cookbook ""Glorious One Pot Meals"" by Elizabeth Yarnell. She has lots of yummy recipes all designed around using the 2 qt size- for 2 servings."

kitchen & housewares,5 of 5,5.0,Wonderful!,"Mom adored these for Mother's Day as she has been asking for them for ages!  They are very durable and thick.  They are also dishwasher, oven, and microwave safe.  They look very attractive for the price, and it's the perfect size for a small snack or even something as gourmet as creme brulee!  Six of such well designed ramekins for this price?  I couldn't believe it"
kitchen & housewares,3 of 3,5.0,Warning,I ordered these dishes and when they arrived I discovered they are not Le Potier but they are actually Provencale--another line manufactured by Emile Henry.  They do not have the rings that Le Potier has nor the creme color on the inside of the mugs.  They are bright white.  
kitchen & housewares,3 of 4,4.0,It's great!,I am pretty happy with this purchase.  Our old vacuum cleaner just didn't have that much suction -- this one sure does!  My only complaints are that it's heavier than my former vacuum and that the cord gets in the way at times.  Other than that it's been smooth sailing
