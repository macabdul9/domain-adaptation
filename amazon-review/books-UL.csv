books,3 of 3,4.0,A Good Start,Being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen I was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor.
books,9 of 13,4.0,Complete Dog book review,"My husband is a dog show judge and has been looking for this book. As always, Amazon has what I need.  This book is 2 yrs out of date, but this isn't Amazons' fault.  Overall, the dog standards have not changed, except AKC has added some new breeds that aren't listed.  Will be valuable with our breed (miniature Dachshunds)"

books,4 of 8,5.0,Waiting for the DVD,I agree with the reviews already posted. This is the only Alice in Wonderland movie in my opinion. As children my sister and I would watch it all the time from a video taped from the television. Years later I saw it in a video store and had to buy it even though it wasn't on DVD. I still have my copies but am waiting patiently for them to be released on DVD
books,,4.0,Engulfing Read,"This was a great read and I think one of the first books Ive read by Nora Roberts(I cant remember if I read her several years ago). The book includes strong characterizations, lust, dysfunction,mystery into this book and I loved seeing the heroine develop to become her own hero in the end. Great read"
books,7 of 8,5.0,An upbeat viewpoint on small business in America,"It seems like all we hear in the news lately is about outsourcing, the stripping away of defined benefit and retirement plans, and that there are no further opportunities to be found in business unless you are one of the lucky few at the top of a multinational corporation. In the face of such constant bad news, this book is a breath of fresh air."
books,2 of 3,5.0,Flynn's Mitch Rapp is an American hero for our time,"In an era when some American citizens openly root for the nation's enemies, Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp character is a refreshing throwback to another era where no American would openly criticize his nation during time of war. Before, yes: after, yes - but not during."
books,3 of 3,4.0,My first Nora and I was hooked,"Some may not consider this one of her best, indeed, it isn't listed as a fav anywhere, but it had enough Nora magic to introduce me to the woman and hook me into devouring everything I could there after."

books,6 of 8,5.0,Gasman NanoBook Important Contribution to the Literature and History of Nano,"As author of the first book on successful investing in nanotechnology, Nanotech Fortunes: Make Yours in the Boom; Winning Strategies, I can say that Nanomarkets.net's Lawrence Gasman has produced an exceptional contribution to the literature of nanotech, Nanotechnology: Applications and Markets. Everyone interested in exactly how nanotech is going to impact products, markets, industries and businesses must study this concise and worthwhile read. Gasman's intuitions, opinions and arguments are not only right on target but they are informed by a lively intelligence and decades of real-life experience and deeply thought analysis. Whether you are in the business or just looking to invest with a real understanding of what you're doing, you are going to love this book and thank the author as well."

books,12 of 16,5.0,"A better world for the creative ahead, Reynolds knows why","After reading An Army of Davids, I thought back eight years earlier when I still subscribed to the Los Angeles Times and one of their Princelings of Political Correctness announced that hereafter the LA Times would apply affirmative action guidelines to the sources of articles. The article was such an unintended parody of political correctness that I rechecked to make sure that Rush Limbaugh had not written it.  How can these people get away with it?"
books,,5.0,great book for ideas,I bought the book to add to my collection of stained glass books. I like the shapes and forms she uses and have gotten a few ideas from it. Very nice
books,4 of 4,5.0,Should have been written 30 years ago,"Probably the most important book that a manager can read.  It demystifies the ""art"" of finance.  It brings finance's secret language back to simple English.  Great for techies who are part of the overhead."
books,3 of 4,5.0,"I've read about 20 other books, this is by far the best one.","After reading this book, I felt like I had a better grasp about foreclosures and the real estate market as a whole."
books,,4.0,Judged to be a great book.,"As judge & jury, I would highly recommend this book.  Patterson can't write a bad book, but this is one of his best"
books,,5.0,"Fantastic read, sure to bring tears to your eyes!","I have only read a few Nicholas Sparks books (The Notebook & The Wedding), so I was eagerly anticipating beginning The Guardian, which had been recommended by me. I absolutely love Sparks' style of writing, and he did not disappoint with The Guardian. From the very first chapter, I was captivated. I felt like I was right there with Julie and Singer during all that ensues throughout the book (I don't want to spoil anything!). I laughed, I cried - I think I went through every emotion by the time I finished this book. That, to me, is the mark of a great book! I definitely recommend this book - it's a quick read and a great story that will not disappoint"

books,0 of 1,5.0,Awesome,I could not put this book down.  VF keeps the story moving quickly and paints great mental pictures.  If you like Clancy you will love Flynn
books,2 of 4,5.0,Handicapping Classic,"Andrew Beyer is the godfather of speed figures in thoroughbred racing. In preparing to bet the Kentucky Derby and other races this year I read Andrew Beyer's fantastic book ""Beyer on Speed"" and Joe Cardello's book ""Speed to Spare"".  These two books fundamentally changed the way I handicap races. It is simply careless to handicap races without understanding Beyer Speed Ratings and use them to your advantage. This book explains the origins of the Beyer Speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work. I used the information on ""Beyer on Speed"" and ""Speed to Spare"" this year (March, 2005) to hit a big trifecta at Santa Anita - without Beyer Speed ratings and the information they provide, I would have never made the bet I made."
books,1 of 6,1.0,Tiresome recap of an exhaustive list of life events,"President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out"
books,3 of 7,5.0,Inspiring!!,"From the moment I picked up this book and started reading it, I could not put it down! Literally. Thank goodness my toddler was still sleeping in the early morning hours, which allowed me to do so. Bill talks about how he was brought up and how is entreprenral mind was formed. It was a very interesting and inspiring read. If you are thinking about going into business for yourself, read this book. It confirms the fact that if you do not go for it, it will never happen. Bill took his dreams and ideas and turned them into reality."
books,10 of 18,2.0,Not if you are looking for recovery help...,"This book is more like a theoretical exploration of what promotes addictive behavior, and will be of no real help to you if you are trying to help (or are yourself) an addict. There is no exploration into what treatments will work or not work, and some of what he says doesn't really seem to make sense in a real-life situation. Overall, it's useless unless you are curious about what might (theoretically) cause addictive behavior"
books,0 of 3,5.0,Fast hilarious read.,"Loved this book.  Not only the wry observations of what happened but the touching, poignant love of her children.  Loved the quip about why do people think that not talking a lot when you're in small town is a virtue.  Zipped through it and laughed out loud"
books,7 of 59,5.0,How to Pick Pockets for Fun and Profit,How to Pick Pockets for Fun and Profit : A Magicians Guide to Pickpocket Magic taught me everything i needed to know about the skills of pickpockets
books,,5.0,Another Victory for Koontz,"I have yet to read a Dean Koontz tale that I dislike. He has such a flair for bringing me into the tale as though I am experiencing it myself. Once I start a Koontz novel I find it difficult to go to sleep until I am done. I enjoy them so much it seems like a guilty pleasure, but it's just a pleasure, no guilt involved"
books,7 of 21,5.0,Brilliant book,"In this book, the author merges her deep knowledge of the field of wireless communication with her passion of transmitting her knowledge to others.  The evident didactic skills of the author are put into service to explain in a clear, profound and accurate way not only the fundamentals of wireless communication systems, but also some of the most recent development in the field, such as MIMO, adaptive modulation, equalization, multicarrier and ad hoc networks, in such a way that the reader will soon find himself immersed in the excitement of this up-to-date knowledge. The book also includes the information theory point of view of both single user and multiuser wireless networks, which are usually omitted in other textbooks in the field.  Students pursuing a degree in electrical engineering will find in the first six chapters a comprehensive treatment of the fundamentals in the subject, saving a lot of time, as very few books treat the fundamentals in such a clear and, at the same time, deep way. Students pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the area will find an indispensable reference. For practicing engineers, this book will provide the design tools of modern wireless networks. This book will shortly become a classic. It is simply, an excellent job."
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Necessary Perspective,"As a professor management who is interested in corporations acting more responsibly, I have just begun to use this book in my senior strategic management course. Hollender is a thoughtful and insightful proponent of socially responsible business.  Each chapter covers a specific characteristics of SRB (accountability, transparency, sustainability, etc.)."
books,,4.0,"good, but not great...","well, imho, not as great as the other books in the allon series, but well worth the read!"
books,22 of 24,5.0,A Life Changing Book,"Not many people know that there was a 10 episode film series with the same title, and that there is a paper back study guide that compliments this book. I first read this book 22 years ago when I was trying to figure out why the world was going to hell in a handbasket. It answered a lot of my questions and made me ask more questions. I rate this as one of the 10 most important books I've read in my lifetime, and I'm getting to be an old lady now. I'm getting ready to read it again because I feel it has a new relevance for our time in light of the persecution of Christianity in the public arena. I also bring to your attention his book, A Christian Manifesto. If you seek true wisdom born of knowledge, this is your book"

books,2 of 2,4.0,Adversity at Its Finest,"Overflowing with thrills and mysteries, a very long journey to treachery, three orphans, a villain and his cohorts; this is what the Penultimate Peril is all bout. This next-to-last book makes some of the mysteries from the previous volumes clear to the series' avid readers."
books,15 of 37,1.0,You will be a dummy if you depend on this book,"Sorry, I just cannot believe that the &quot;humorous&quot; and &quot;honest&quot; approaches recommended in this book will work. It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think"
books,1 of 3,5.0,Understanding and Using English Grammar (Third Edition),"I have used this outstanding book with international students for several years, but it would be helpful if the Answer Key were available from Amazon."
books,1 of 1,4.0,For Love:  Thought Provoking,"For Love is a subdued, mature chronicle of a woman coming to terms with adult relationships. This book tells the story of Lottie, a woman haunted by her and her new husband's pasts. The tone is detached with the author perhaps purposefully distancing the readers from intense emotion. Themes in the book include love (of course) both romantic and familial, identity, loyalty, maturation, and conscious living. It is not a tale packed with action-- though it decidedly lures us with a ""what will ever happen?"" plot thread. Sue Miller nimbly and impressively weaves the plot back and forth through time and through the emotional state of the protaganist (Lottie). It is a first person account told in third person (hence the distancing). This device may be used to emulate the lack of connection and knowledge Lottie has with and of herself. This book presents the simple unfolding of a story completed with brilliant technique and subtlety. Would I recommend this book? Yes. It contains simple life truths which provoke soul searching and contemplation. To whom would I recommend it? Patient readers. Those willing to take the time to meander with the author and the protangonist through the often stream of consciousness narration. Was this book life changing for me? Yes. It helped me wrap my mind around two ideas that while very intuitive seemed very fresh and enrichming for me: 1) When we love people, that love will either stretch to include all different versions of them as they grow and change, or it won't... lasting love takes work in that regard. How is this work done? This leads me to idea # 2) Sometimes we have to pretend to love the changed version of a person we once loved (or pretend to embrace the true nature person who we idealized as something else) until that love can adapt and become a reality. Will this book change the way I live? It will change my perspective. If the book's philosophy is correct and thought follow actions... then yes... it will have changed my life. I enjoyed this book for it's unlikely marriage of depth and simplicity"

books,,5.0,Billion Dollar Book,"When I read that Michael Crichton made almost a billion dollars for  Jurassic Park, I was a little surprised. I saw the movie, it was ok, not to my tastes though. Then I read the book. Then I knew why."
books,1 of 13,1.0,wish I could demand a refund!,"This book is nothing more than a bunch of nonsense. It contains endless statements making no sense. I was truly looking forward to a book that would be a refreshing alternative to most pop-psychology that's on the market. Instead I got a text that was written by someone who couldn't think. It was full of illogical, unsupported statements and arguments. If I could, I would demand my money back I'm that upset with my purchase.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone who has any ability to think whatsoever"
books,5 of 5,5.0,The addictive Personality: Understanding the Addictive Process and Compulsive Behavior,"As a middle aged woman, married to a sex addict in denial, reading this book proved to be a most enlightening experience.  Of the 15 or so books I have read on the subject, I found this to be the most explicit and succinctly worded in just 120 pages. I highly recommend it to anyone struggling to comprehend the world of an addict in their life."
books,0 of 13,5.0,this book rocks,this book sucks very badly! as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place!!
books,,4.0,read between lines,"This book is worth to read. You will find plenty of interesting ideas and things u can use in u life, even if u are not manager and is not planning to be. U can advance to some level by reviewing and using some clear techniques."
books,6 of 8,2.0,Why Do People Love It?,"This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal.  It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone.  I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Funny but a little sad too,"I absolutely loved James Lileks' two previous books and found them achingly funny, but like several other reviewers, I found ""Mommy Knows Worst"" to be tinged with sadness at times.  Yes, it was very funny, but on the other hand I ended up feeling so sorry for mothers that actually followed this kind of advice (like my mother) and kids who were subjected to it (like me) that it tempered my enjoyment somewhat."
books,0 of 1,5.0,Very Suspenseful,I really enjoyed this book - it kept me guessing what would happen next.  I didn't want to put it down
books,1 of 1,5.0,Wow!,"What a great book!  420 pages, hardback, and every single page is worth reading, not one page is boring.  You just want to keep reading and keep turning pages!"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Bending over backwards for students who don't care,"This book contains a lot of useful information for the new teacher or the burned out teacher who needs a boost. It's useful in the sense that it tries to get teachers to stop taking negative beahvior personally (usually it's not about the teacher) and to use positive reinforcement as much as possible--always a good idea whenever you are trying to change behavior, be it animal or human! But I had to laugh out loud when the author suggests praising the consistently tardy student for being in class ""most of the time."" Give me a break!"
books,5 of 8,1.0,There are errors and other complexities involved.,"The programs are not really &quot;ready-to-run.&quot; They are not &quot;Ready-to-use.&quot; Programming is required, because there are bugs in html documents and scripts that must be corrected. The book is a good resource of information for people who want to study and learn and troubleshoot and learn Perl, because it is possible to get the scripts to work if the troubleshooter does not give up until they get things to work satisfactorily. I believe that it is practically impossible for a person to use these scripts without having some experience with Perl and CGI and HTML. The book has a lot of good explanations of code, which I find helpful and useful. I can't blame anyone for selling the book in the way it is sold. Salesmen sell the book. Programmers who successfully learn, don't give up when things don't work easily. This is book for beginning programmers"
books,1 of 8,1.0,sorta funny,"This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield"
books,0 of 1,4.0,Fills in a lot of blanks - barely,"Dont know much about History does pretty much what it purports to do; fill in certain blanks in US history in a concise, almost too concise, manner. It is quite objective and makes no attempt to re-write history to promote a particular political leaning - until the final chapters. Then it is fairly clear that Dr. Davis leans a bit away from the status quo. This poses no real problem, as most of the Viet Nam generation are quite negative as to how that was handled. Now, the next edition of this book, which will of necessity deal with Irak, will be a very interesting read"
books,2 of 4,5.0,A safe bet.,"A very well written book. Easy to read, entertaining and full of useful information, this book makes otherwise complex theories easy to follow. The use of anecdotes and real life examples allow for easier understanding of the ideas presented. This is a useful addition to the library of any horseracing fan. The serious student of horse racing handicapping should easily recover several times the price of the book from using the information presented - that is a safe bet"
books,13 of 14,5.0,The best debt management tool on the market!,"&quot;Credit Card and Debt Management&quot; is without a doubt the TOP OF THE LINE in its class.  After having read through several debt management books, this one assisted me the most in debt reduction and managing personal finances.  It's clear, concise and practical, with real world examples to learn from.  As a member of the U.S. military who has had to relocate every few years, the use of credit cards has been essential in maintaining an enjoyable quality of life.  This book has greatly assisted in balancing it all. Investing in &quot;Credit Card and Debt Management&quot; is money well spent"
books,7 of 9,5.0,Excellent dragon info.,"Just this last fall my guardian dragon was revealed to me through meditation, before I found this book.  This book has helped me to understand and connect with my guardian better.  It is the only one I have seen that deals with dragons as  real beings, able to manifest in our world they want to, or when they are needed.  I am very grateful to D.J.Conway for having the guts to write and publish this book.  It has been a revelation for me."
books,4 of 7,5.0,Only people that has right to say anything about these drugs are the people that have taken them,"Some people think they are so smart that they know everything about these drugs and chemistry, no matter how smart you are and lets say youre #1 top psychiatrists in the world. If you havent taken the SSRI yourself and experienced the damaging affect of these drugs, you cant say anything PERIOD. Not even if you invented the drug !!!!! Why do we have so many people complaining about these drugs? duh maybe because there is a problem and causing problems!!!, people who havent tried or experience the damaging affects afterwards dont see why people are complaining. We dont see books about warning people not to take for example flu shots do we? No. I used to be one of those people who believed and that popping a pill can solve my life problems but Now because of SSRI my life is ruined and have permanant problems that wont go away. And for people who are currently on SSRI, pills will never ever cure depression unless you stay on them forever,Im sure you are happy with those fake smiles, see what happens when you taper off of them. And people who are FOR these drugs should immediately go to doctors and try them and see how safe they are. I recommend you try prozac first. If that dont work out dont worry there are plenty others that doctors will want you to try. HAHAHA so sad that there are still people out there in this country that really believe these pills can help them"
books,,5.0,Maximum Ride: School's Out Forever,"I have really enjoyed both books about Max that James Patterson has written. Although he has created a unique family due to their scientific beginnings, they continue to face similuar issues that many young people and diverse families face. I can't wait for Mr. Patterson's next version of life as only Max knows it"
books,2 of 2,4.0,"Good Enough for American Investors, Lack International Perspectives","Tobias writes a bible in personal financial investment without the lack of humor and personal touch.

My younger son has wanted this collection for a long time so this year on his birthday I bought it for him.  It arrived in perfect condition.

books,1 of 2,4.0,Reveals More About Baseball,"Money Ball was a great book. It shows that you don't need money to win in baseball(take that Yankees ;-P) Michael Lewis reavels that the team with the 2nd lowest payroll, the Oakland Athletics, can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team. Lewis also tells the story of Billy Beane the GM of the Athletics. Billy's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the MLB. He exerts his attitude as a force over the so-called ""experts"" when a desicion must be made. Billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of. He shows that there are many aspects of the game that we don't know. All in all, this was an excellant book. My only complaint was that there was a lot of swearing.--- Jesse Hartman"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent Motivational Book,"I have owned Self Promotion for the Creative Person for two and a half years now. I regret that I did not write a review sooner, since it is one of the best motivational books I have read. It has helped me to transform a fun but unsuccessful hobby/business into a thriving and extremely satisfying mission, in which I have found my passion [...]"
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Relationships, not contacts!","I'll be honest, even though I chose this book myself I was very skeptical when I first approached it - there is something in the title that challenged my status quo. I am introvert and our society tends to value extraverted nature; I was afraid that this book would repeat this extraversion mantra all over again, and I couldn't have been more wrong, what I found was volumes of invaluable advice!"

books,1 of 2,5.0,Reading Lolita in Tehran...for ENGL 474 (Jenn Kight),"In all honesty, upon first reading the course list for ENGL 474 Issues in Rhetoric, I did not immediately understand why this book was in the course list. But, now that we're halfway through the book, I understand quite well. This book answers some questions that I've had in my own mind regarding why certain books are banned. The book discusses Gatsby, by FS Fitzgerald, as it is a work studied by the author's class in the Tehran U. I read Gatsby twice in highschool and never considered it a controversial work. However, in American society, we are well acquainted with the idea of cheating on spouses, for example, (as it is always all over the news/tabloids at the grocery store - ""who's cheating on who"", etc.) which is one of the issues that the Islamic students in Nafisi's class found disturbing. But in Iran, however, during the Revolution, everything was controversial - but the concept of adultery to Nafisi's characters is completely heinous. So, culture plays a huge role in why works are banned or are considered controversial."
books,3 of 3,5.0,The yoga of aging consciously,"This is a book on the yoga of aging consciously. In 1997 Ram Dass experienced a stroke that left him with expressive aphasia and partial paralysis. He has learned the hard way that aging can be unkind to the body, but in every situation Dass seeks the opportunity for spiritual growth. He teaches us how to diminish our suffering despite the aches, pains, and limitations that come to us with age by stepping away from the ego-self to embrace the soul-self, where we can witness our thoughts and emotions and evaluate their effects on us. No one gets out of life alive. Read this book and enjoy the journey"

books,1 of 2,5.0,There is something about young writers,"This is probably one of the best books I have read in this century. We, elderly readers, have usually fair memories and can stack one writer against the other. By every comparison, Ms. Smith winns hands down. Her language is original and refreshing. Her characters very much alive. If they suffer from common falacies she can treat all of it in very humane and understanding way. The story she tells is fascinating,well conceived and even better executed. The resolution is unusual in any case.Of all the young writers publishing in English currently (and I've read a few) she is my favorite."
books,,5.0,Born.....TO BE A WINNER!,Those of us who have kept up with this series will be both amused and touched by the birth of Mavis' baby.

And the concept of male birth control pills is a forever dream of mine in my field of abuse counselling!
books,1 of 1,1.0,Too popular to bother trying anymore.,"J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.

Buckingham and Clifton have succeeded in bringing to life an idea that is enormously practical and helpful.  Using themes as a means of describing one's gifts, Buckingham and Clifton have given me enormous insights about who I am and why I do the things I do. More importantly, they have taught me not only to accept my weaknesses but how to management both my strengths and weaknesses, so that, I can learn to be better than anyone else in my strengths.  Thank you Marcus and Donald."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Great Book for Administrators and Developers,"This book is very thorough. There's some great chapters on customization and server management; information that has been non-existent until Microsoft released this book. I have bought every book available for my team and this is the only one that covers SharePoint as deep on the topics of administration, search, configuration and architecture. The Book-CD has a lot more as well. My team references this book frequently. To me, it's the first true SharePoint administrator's book available."
books,3 of 3,5.0,"Sherri Cannon, CEO, The Cannon Group, Inc., Rancho Palos Verdes, CA","First, compliments to Dressler for successfully resisting the temptation to unnecessarily 'inflate' the size of this book. As a result, Consensus through Conversation is digestible during a reasonable length plane flight. What makes it worthwhile to read on your NEXT plane trip is this: unlike many authors who are intellectually sound but lack ""on the ground"" skills, Dressler is different. He knows how to bring about sustainable improvement in organizational productivity. Even better, he knows how to TEACH others to do the same. That's what this book does--illustrates WHY real conversation is essential to affect lasting change. And then, takes us from ivory tower to ground level by producing a tool box of diagrams, tips, do's & don'ts, and straight talk. If every author packed this much value into 77 pages, we would all spend more time IMPROVING our organizations than reading about it.  Thanks for raising the bar, Larry."
books,,4.0,"Insightful, well-written analysis","I've read several bestsellers on the implications of the internet, but found this one a notch above the rest. Whilst others are often totally skewed by commercial and technological aspects, this one went a lot deeper and touched on the Meta changes underlying society. But far from being a grand, generalist thesis, Lewis grounds his observations in real flesh-and-blood stories that are highly readable. His experience as a professional writer shines through on every page."
books,2 of 2,5.0,My all-time favorite!,"I can recite most of it from memory, I love it so!  I tell people about it all the time and recommend it (along with Alexander Who Used To Be Rich Last Sunday) as a staple in every library.  It's a great one to have even if you don't have kids (sometimes the little buggers show up for visits!) This book does a hilarious job of pointing out to kids that some days just stink and that you live through them anyway.  The illustations have some great humor for the adults.  Read it aloud to someone you love! Aura Mae, Author of Get Some Hairapy - a hairdresser's prescription for happiness"
books,12 of 14,4.0,Feel- Good History is all Around Us,"James Loewen is an academic scholar who feels very strongly about the misinformation presented at places of historical significance. This book presents a listing of ninety- five historic sites, historic parks, and historic markers that don't quite get the story correct. Arranged in the book from west to east, each state in the U.S. includes at least one listing and some states have several. They all have one thing in common: They either lie outright or they present misleading information about what took place."

books,6 of 10,4.0,Solid foundation and background,"Not only has this professor studied the country of Iraq, he has studied its language and its history.  Unlike many authors writing about Iraq, he has lived there.  He was also a policy advisor during the Kennedy administration.  Given this, he has a better perspective than most who have written about it."
books,3 of 7,2.0,No there there,"I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work.  There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were.  From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver.  The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally"
books,1 of 1,5.0,The life and times of Mitch Rafferty,"Dean Koontz's latest novel is a great thriller that I found myself not wanting to put down.  Like Stephen King, I feel some of Dean's best writing is when he is not involving the supernatural playing card in the deck.  The characters seem a little deeper, the story very plausible, and the tasks, tragedies and triumphs a bit more heartfelt, making you, the reader, care that much more about the outcome."

Would be nice to have some sort of menu planner, for example buy the ingredients for one dinner and some of those can be used the next day for lunch or another dinner so I dont have a box of 11 eggs left over.

books,3 of 4,2.0,Not at all what I expected,"While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest."

books,12 of 17,5.0,Fighting the Good Fight,"This book fights the spiritual war against the &quot;end-justifies-the-means&quot; young earth cult. If you paid hard-earned money to send your children to a Christian school (as I have) only to have them exposed to hideous Kent Hovind videos, you will appreciate this book's clear exposition of the young earth fallacy. I never understood how World War II Germany could follow Hitler until the young earth propaganda machine deceived so many Christians. I hope others will join me in loaning a copy of this book to a young earth follower in their area. This book does a great job in challenging us to reduce the young earth following by taking a stand for God's truth"

I first got it for my best friend and he thought it was crazy but goo, so I gave it a try. Great book, CRAZY, but halarious. If you like the show then this book has the same comedy style so give it a try"
books,4 of 5,5.0,A great read on Modern Africa,"In this thorough grand history of Africa since independence every story is told, every nation explained and everything from economics to politics fully laid out.  In a region by region view all the great and tragic stories of Africa since 1950 are told, from Idi Amin ot Hastings Banda to Aparthied to the war in Angola and the death of Lumumba.  No stone is left unturned.  From Nasser to De Klerk to the Biafran war, to Rwanda  and Sudan.  This is an eminently fair account, unbiased and accurate, a giant tour of the continent of despair and hope.  Although a massive read the author writes with skill and interest, thoroughly researched with obscure primary sources and based on new material available from archives this book is a wonderful account of modern Africa."
books,11 of 13,1.0,Rather pointless,"This book fails both as a history or analysis of Yugoslav politics or as a critical biography of Tito. The first few chapters, which contain an overly compressed ""historical"" review of the South Slavs from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, contain factual, spelling and interpretative errors so obtrusive and atrocious that they are almost laughable. For example, West claims that the leader of the 1573 Croat peasant revolt was ""Donja Stubica"" - that was actually the name of the village in which it started. He claims that in 1871 the Croat revolutionary Eugen Kvaternik led an ""armed assault on the Serbs,"" when in fact Kvaternik launched a foolishly bold uprising against the Habsburg Monarchy while many of his fellow rebels were themselves Serbs. He persistently misspells the surname of the great Serbian linguist and writer Vuk Karadzic as `Karadjic' - and there are literally dozens of similar mistakes that riddle the entire text. West basically argues that the problems in Yugoslavia are directly tied to historical events and religious schisms that occurred during the Middle Ages, and reduces the wars which ensued after Yugoslavia's collapse to religious conflicts. He also insists that there are no national nor even ethnic differences between the Serbs, Croats or Bosnian Muslims; rather, he says they are all the same ethnic group with three different religions, thus demonstrating his glaring ignorance of the differences between `nation' and `ethnicity,' among other things. He focuses extensive attention and invective, perhaps rightfully, to the WW2 Croatian Ustasha regime and the often scurrilous role of the Croatian Catholic Church during this period. On the other hand, he downplays or denies the much less extensive but often quite brutal crimes of the Serbian Chetniks during the same period - even to the point of making the ludicrous claim that the Serbian Orthodox Church was ""never clearly associated with Great Serb nationalism or with the Chetniks."" One of the main flaws of this book is that its primary focus is on World War II - the implication being that this period crucially influenced events in the 1990s. This is only true to a certain extent, but oversimplifies and greatly downplays the even more vital 40+ ensuing years. In fact, at times this book rather eerily resembles texts often seen in Croatian and Serbian newspapers during the late 1980s and early 1990s which speak of events from 50, 150 or even 500 years ago as though they happened yesterday. West's ignorance and lack of objectivity also leads him to (rather outrageously) twice refer to the Kosovo Albanians as `Shiptars' - among non-Albanians, this is a racial epithet, not a neutral descriptive term. Tito, the central figure in this book, fares little better. Although West has a nostalgically favorable view of Tito, he offers no new insights into Yugoslavia's long-time president and strongman, only the reworded observations and conclusions from other biographies, memoirs and histories, both favorable and critical. Often he provides details on completely trivial matters from Tito's life, at one point even citing actor Richard Burton's impressions of Tito and his wife. Aside from a few mildly engaging anecdotes taken from his own travels in Yugoslavia, there is little of interest here. Reading West's book is a colossal waste of time; my recommendation is for readers to check it out of a library, peruse the photographs and then go straight to the bibliography to find more worthwhile books to read on Tito, WW2 and the Ustasha terror and the former Yugoslavia in general"
books,,5.0,Wow,"In a word, WOW.  This book is ranked in the top five greatest books that I've ever read.  Clancy uses incredibly specific and intricate descriptions of the nautical military to create a real life atmosphere that the reader can relate to.  Real military events were used to shape the plot of the story, and Amazon.com even states that Clancy was rumored to have been debriefed by the White House during the production of this novel."
books,4 of 5,4.0,An alternative view of nationalism,"Pranab Chatterjee wisely cautions us to remember that there are ways of expressing nationalism that differ from the Western models. With examples from literature and history the author helps us explore the  &quot;inner&quot; spiritual or cultural world of Bengalis in colonial  India, a world they tried to keep safe and distinct from the  &quot;outer&quot; world of British-imposed politics. The writing in places  is a bit vague, but the reading is worth the effort to remind us that  wisdom does not begin and end in the West"
books,4 of 6,2.0,Audio CD version is even worse,"I found this to be a really annoying, and - in the audio format - annoyingly-told story. It sounds like a screenplay, with symbolism, mystery, and trivia that are so mediocre... how best to describe it? Here, read the book if you think this is fascinating: the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it's round like a mother's womb. If that doesn't blow you away, read something else."
books,34 of 38,5.0,The Best Gift This Year!,"I received ""The Vegan Diet as Chronic Disease Prevention"" a few days ago for my birthday and have not been able to put it down since.  I know, that sounds like something one would say about a good novel, not a diet book, but this isn't your typical ""diet"" book.  It outlines all the different ""diseases"" that are CAUSED by diet, and provides a roadmap for reversing or stopping the damage.  As I read the ""Vegan Diet..."", I can't help but think about the friends and family that I have that could be helped by following the advise given within.  From the coworker with a daughter ""diagnosed"" with A.D.D. (this same coworker blurted out the other day that Cheetos must be healthy because they have ""cheese"" on them), to my dangerously overweight cousin, everyone knows someone that could be helped by this book.  I know what many of my friends will be getting for Christmas this year, a copy of this book"
books,11 of 11,5.0,A Phd who deserves the respect he gets,"As a matter of fact Martin Zweig is one of the few Phds who's ""able"" to explain even somewhat complicated subjects in plain words.

books,,5.0,... randomly entertaining...,"My story regarding the way I encountered this book may quite differ from other reviewers' experiences. I came by this book randomly my first year of high school when my english teacher one day ""forced"" us to choose a book displayed in class to read IMMEDIATELY [oh, these long-gone years of high school...] so this was the book I ended up with. I honestly didn't know what to expect, other than I highly doubted I would end up liking this science-fiction type of story...This was not my usual cup of tea. Nevertheless, being the type of person who must finish a book always, regardless of if I enjoy it or not, I started reading the book, and before I knew it, I had concluded it. Although I may not disagree that starting elsewhere may be of great help, I do like to share the fact that I WAS one of these ""random-pickers"" and in this case, it did NOT turn out ""disastrous"" as many may gather to be the case. Or at least, it was not nearly as bad as one could anticipate for this kind of novel, since I fully agree that for science fiction works, one may find himself completely lost had he not first visited the earlier works... I allowed myself to be open-minded as I read the novel, allowing my mind to create perceptions and concepts I was not used to dealing with in the past since my exposure to science fiction was practically non-existent. I believe this approach helped me greatly in enjoying the book, and I quite enjoyed doing so. I found this book very entertaining, and given my usual taste in novels, very different from the rest of my book collection. This is something I am greatful for, since I'm often up for new experiences, and I will be honest in saying that after reading this book, it has opened up the doors to the possibility of my reading more, if not all, Heinlein accomplishments."
books,5 of 5,5.0,Some good lessons for home-based entrepreneurs...,"This is an important book for women who choose to work from home or who decide to start a home-based business. A big, big minus to working from home is the sense of isolation and lack of daily networking opportunities. It is critically important to maintain visibility, and that takes a concerted effort! Publicity must be part of the strategy for success - and it especially important for home-based businesses. I'm not talking about advertising; I'm talking about community visibility - personal publicity that lets potential customers and clients know who you are, what you do, and why they should buy from you or work with you. The women in this book are a good example of how even a small amount of the right publicity can produce a big, big payoff. Certainly all home-based operations will not hit the one million mark. But that's not a bad goal to keep in mind! (Reviewed by Marion E. Gold - author of the &quot;Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU&quot; and &quot;TOP COPS: Profiles of Women in Command"
books,14 of 15,5.0,Really worth 4.5 Stars,"I enjoyed this book but was spoiled because I first read ""The Mystery of Capital"" and then this.  This book's stats are somewhat outdated because so much has happened in the last 15-20 years, which takes away from the crispness of the argument, but the argument is still apparent and sound.  Although I agree that eliminating government red tape to let more people become a part of the economic system and therefore become plugged into the benefits of the system (eg, a legal work address for customers to reach you at, legal recognition so to advertise, etc.) and thereby allow government to collect more taxes so to (hopefully) put more money toward fighting social problems; I hope de Soto agrees that the economic answer to terroism is not the only answer.  Stregthening the economic infrastructure is a strong part of the answer, but much more is also needed for some people to not desire to kill other people, and that may be something which can never be had.  Although I would say ""The Mystery of Capital"" is a must read, this is nonetheless a great supplement to ""The Mystery of Capital"""
books,1 of 1,5.0,"The Law was not about truth. It was about negotiation, amelioration and manipulation.","Michael Haller's life revolves around criminal defense, his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car. His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy, people either called him Mick or Mickey. Tall, dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch. In the court room he was very together with great timing, in his personal life it was a mess, at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter. His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to, his father wrote books and practised law that didn't have room for innocent clients, so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn't recognize innocence if it came along. Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll, he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn't afford to pay his fees. In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour, what he was really looking for was a franchise player, a case to keep the cash rolling, point blank a meal ticket."

books,2 of 4,5.0,Makes you proud,"This has been a most surprising opportunity to enjoy the history of our society as seen through the eyes of a British historian.  The author admittedly is a strong admirer of the American people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live.  He supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey.  We are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that I studied going through school in the 1930's and 1940's.  Alas, maybe Washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all."

books,3 of 7,5.0,A Thoughtful and Important Book,"This is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened. It DOES NOT deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse (the author explicitly states this on many occasions) and the reviewer who suggested that this is ""a terrific book if you are child molester"" probably (I guess) didn't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy."

books,31 of 33,5.0,candid indeed,"I have now been in the work force for 6 years having mostly worked in, now defunct, internet shops. Now I have a sterile job as a financial analyst working for a HUGE company. After being afraid to pursue my dreams again (after an earlier attempt in my mid-20's withered away...), I am seriously looking to get my masters in architecture although I have a liberal arts degree. I first read Cesar Pelli's &quot;Observations&quot; which inspired me. So I was afraid to get into this book knowing that many reviews here and in newsgroups claim it's harsh or may change your mind about architecture. Actually, it has strengthened my desire to pursue architecture. I won't be making as much money as I do now in my somewhat laid-back job, but there are other considerations far more important to me than working just for money. People who do not wish to be challenged to their fullest or work harder than they ever have worked before should not pursue such careers medicine, law, computer science, etc - architecture is no exception. I already knew architects are rarely rich, work very hard, go through a very tough education, and work in a very competitive environment. None of that came as a shock from reading this. Basically, I can conclude from this book that the field should only be pursued if one LOVES architecture despite all the difficulties. One can dislike medicine or law and not be as discouraged since the money can provide some comfort, but teh same is not true of architecture. Even if this book does talk many out of pursuing architecture, it's better that it tells it like it is. I'd rather know the good and the bad before making a decision. By the way, this book is not nearly as negative as some here have pointed out"
books,6 of 6,5.0,Very Good Book for Small Investors,"I've read this book 3 times.  It is written very clearly with specifics about the author's experiences in purchasing and managing rental homes, very little ""fluff"".  Geared more towards beginning investors, but intermediate investors will also pick up some good tips."
books,14 of 15,5.0,Kay is Back!,"This year movie buffs are extremely fortunate because out on the market is not one but two wonderful new biographies of the actress who ""couldn't wait to be forgotten""--Kay Francis.  Lynn Kear and John Rossman have done a superb job of detailing Kay's life with an especially rich section about her early life--prior to Hollywood stardom. The book also captures the essence of the jazz age of the 1920's when women were coming out of their shells and becoming less uninhibited. In many ways Kay Francis was the epitomization of the free spirited women of the jazz age. The book, as usual for a McFarland product, is lovely to look at and the picture quality is superb.  Both books quote from Kay's diaries which were long forgotten at a University archives.  The diaries provide much of the dynamic revelations in the narrative--Kay's candid thoughts about her life and (many) lovers.  Kay Francis certainly did, as the title says, have a passionate life--and a career which movie buffs and fans can easily appreciate.  We are fortunate to have this wonderful book as a reminder of that life and career"

books,,5.0,Must read for the serious student of theology,I recommend this book to anyone who has come from a dispensational background and is interested in eschatology (end-times).  It is very well written with short chapters that don't bog the reader down with difficult theological jargon.  Exposes the reader to a historicist (typically Seventh Day Adventist) interpretation of end-times scriptures that will challenge you to dig deeper into the Word of God with a critical eye
books,0 of 2,1.0,RBAC Jack - Caveat Emptor!,"I purchased the digital version of this book for which I totally regret.  First, the book is bloated and really offers little more than can be viewed free on NIST's Website.  Second, the Adobe DRM (Digital Rights Manager) reader won't let you make a backup copy and Amazon (i.e., their Indian Customer ""Service"" Reps anyway) don't understand either U.S. fair use Copyright laws or customer service.  Thus not only wouldn't I buy this book...I won't ever buy another product from Amazon ever again."
books,8 of 9,5.0,Superb writing,"No, this is not the Da Vinci Code. Or John Grisham's The Firm. But here's the good news: I enjoyed both the Da Vinci Code and The Firm, and I loved The Great Fire. You don't need to be a snob to enjoy this book. It's a great story with great characters. But you're more likely to enjoy it if you really love writing (not just a good story, but also how language is used to get the story across). It is true that you will be challenged at times. When I started reading the book, I had the feeling that I didn't really know what was going on or who was who--Hazzard's style is not very linear. But in time everything starts making perfect sense, and you can't help being fascinated by the extraordinary command of the English prose that Hazzard has. With one sentence she can convey a place, a time, a feeling, an emotion in a way that you'll think you're there and it's happening to you. I believe she's one of the most talented writers I have ever encountered, and I've read a lot. I recommend this book to anyone who truly loves both great fiction and the English language"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Best Vegetarian Book Ever!!!,"I LOVE this book! Being the only vegetarian in my family (and also being a 'kid')makes it really hard to find things to eat that are healthy that I still like. The Teen's Vegetarian Cookbook is the best cookbook I've ever used. The format is fantastic, the instructions are really simple to follow, the recipes don't usually include strange things or anything that no one would actually eat. If you're vegan, there are lots of really good recipes that don't contain any animal products at all. This book isn't just for vegetarians, though! I got my whole family eating some of it. They added meat to theirs, but they still love the pizza dough. I even make the Chocolate Coma Pie for a party and everyone ate it and enjoyed it. Whether you're a teen, a parent, someone hoping to eat more healthy but still delicious food, or you were just dared to be vegetarian for a week, this book is the ULTIMATE!"

From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the ""Christmas [...]"" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris"

I am afraid this book is nothing more then modernday snake-oil that will cause more harm then good."

It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think"

A little odd, and Kinsey wasn't sure what to make of this thing. So she takes Alvin Limardo's retainer check anyhow. It turns out that his real name is not Alvin Limardo, but John Daggett. And the check of course, is as phony as he is. John Daggett has a record as long as your arm and a reputation for sleazy deals. But he wasn't just a deadbeat. By the time Kinsey caught up with him, he was a dead body-with a whole host of people who were delighted to see him dead. There was four in particular that REALLY wanted him dead.

books,7 of 24,5.0,Book fails to address the root causes.....,"This book is a fantastic collection of the effects and symptoms of greed and materialism.

books,0 of 1,2.0,Alex Rider Series jumps the shark . . .,"Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really ""jumps the shark"", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the ""corrupt rich guy"" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead"

One reviewer said it ""will likely let you down, unless your favorite theme in Koontz's books is the transcendence of horror by uplifting spirituality"".  Well, yes!  That's the whole reason I read Koontz books - otherwise I don't think I'd be able to sleep at night!  I love the redemption twist he writes into many of his stories (The Face, anyone?).  Anyone can write straight horror without hope, but Koontz acknowledges a bigger picture, and I hope he keeps it up"

I wondered a little whether Ehrman would be able to keep it interesting: once you get past the initial glitter, there's a fact which Ehrman has commented on in his other works, that ancient gnosticism was pretty weird and hard for the average person to maintain a deep interest in. However, Ehrman handles it all as skillfully as I've come to expect from his previous works, such as Misquoting Jesus and Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millenium."

books,15 of 16,5.0,Great book!,"I suffer from both RA and Ankylosing Spondolitis.  I found out through this program that I cannot eat wheat, milk or dairy products, eggs, sugar or coffee.  When I'm good at sticking to it, I'm almost in complete remission.  When I cheat, I pay for it. Within 20 minutes of consuming one of the above items, my fingers begin to swell and get stiff, and by the next morning I'm in a lot of pain. I have been able to stop taking the Methatrexate and Lodin which were very hard on the liver and destroyed my immune system.  This is a really great program and it works if you have the discipline and self motivation to go through it and stick it out. If you are completely lazy and looking for an easy fix, this may not be for you.  It's hard!  It has been hard for me to give up coffee, Lucky Charms for breakfast, hot chocolate, cookies and some other comfort foods. But in the end I have a lot of new favorites, my inflamation and pain have disappeared, I've lost weight and my skin looks fabulous to boot. God bless Barbara Allan! She's an angel"
books,10 of 11,4.0,Fun to Read,"I picked this up on a recent vacation to Minnapolis and found I couldn't put it down. I do think the book does omit some key cult writers but the ones who are included are handled by writers who obviously know their subjects. This guide includes a lot of my favorite writers (Jonathan Coe, Italo Calvino, Jasper Fforde, Borges, etc.) and I was pleased to find out some things about their lives and work that I didn't know before. The guide points out the writers' essential works and suggests  what a particular writer might have in common with another writer. The book is often funny without being mean-spirited"

books,1 of 1,5.0,The very very best of Nora Roberts,"I've read quite a few of Nora Roberts's books and this was the only one on which I had the complete 'wowzer' reaction.  I mean, seriously: wow.  This is a book full of content, with enough dimensions to the story to keep me busy for weeks and weeks, reading and rereading it to get it all.  Ms Roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of Hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the Olympic Rain Forest.  The characters are likable, and believable, and most certainly not your average Roberts book.  Livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as Noah could be a persistent annoyance.  And readers will find themselves grieving for Julie MacBride along with Jamie, Rob, Val, David and Livvy herself.  And there's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling . ."

One is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on Starbucks? Another one goes back to her husband. One runs into a tree while skiing and dies. Frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad. Jeez, I was really hoping to like this book, but I just am relieved it is over"

In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles!

Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT"

It's actually based on Bukowski's life and the events that lead up to and involve the making of his movie &quot;Barfly.&quot;  It's totally off the wall, but Bukowski's take on Hollywood's own particular brand of insanity is probably just as true today as it was when Charles Bukowski penned this masterpiece of the absurd.  Definitely a great book from one of my favorite writers.  Highly recommended"
books,,5.0,I didn't expect it to be this great!,"I bought this Audio CD looking for that one NEW concept that changes the way I think about money/risk/living in general. I found many more than one, plus I've listened to it 3 times in the two days I had it, audio CDs are great for that! If your looking for business ideas or investment advice you're not really going to get it here. I did disagree with his comments on buying real estate at any means (as an investor, one should only buy real estate property at zero or positive cashflow or they should move on to the next property). A great real estate investment book the is Weekend Millionaire's Guide to Real Estate investing and the Mindset book (amazing books!). He talks about the MINDSET you have to have to take the ACTIONS despite of your FEARS. Futhermore, he elaborates on the following. Your THOUGHTS determine your FEELINGS and your feelings determine what you DO. DOING translates your desires, visualizations, etc... into reality. The biggest thing I got out of this book is the following warning: ""I already know that"" is what most people, especially poor people say in most aspects of their life and don't further educate themselves in a topic. Rich people are always learning and applying what they learn. If you have read 1000+ books on money, investing, whatever you want in life and you don't have the results you want its two things. One, you're MINDSET is not right for that task and you DON'T UNDERSTAND what those books were saying. If you did UNDERSTAND, you would be taking all the ACTIONS spelled out and like SCIENCE your life would reflect them (CAUSE and EFFECT). Notice how I said YOU and not blameing outter circumstances for your financial situation. Great book, Add to Cart!"

books,8 of 10,5.0,He writes about Walking ones Talk,"It was after reading the authors Culture of Disbelief that made me want to read INTEGRITY. For weeks I had been searching for a book that would best sum up my belief that there are to many hypocrites. People who say one  thing but act the opposite. I knew there was a word or theory that would  best describe how I felt and then I saw this book and it was like a  lightbulb going on. INTEGRITY. It is all about having the gutts to be the  person you project yourself to be. Prof Carter has this gift for opening  your eyes and you find yourself going &quot;That's Right!&quot; &quot;Yes  that's true&quot; &quot;Oh my god that's right&quot; or simply  &quot;YES!&quot;  Then I got to page 31 and he mentions Commitment. Then  begins to describe how we as Americans want reliability, and how we each  admire the rare soul who has the integrity to do what is right while all  the naysayers mock. How we love it when someone keeps a promise. He then  discusses being Forthright, Steadfastness. This is a must read in this  election year. A great book for reminding that ethical little person inside  all of us that sometimes all it takes to renew anothers faith in humanity  is for one man or woman to walk their talk"

books,16 of 17,5.0,"A Lighthearted Review of Bill Plotkin's book, Soulcraft","What do you get when you cross a Jungian-oriented depth psychologist, an ecotherapist, and a wilderness guide of the highest caliber?  And then what do you do?  The answer to the first question is Bill Plotkin, director of Animas Valley Institute (www.animas.org).  The answer to the second:  spend 20+ years creating a way to approach soul in a culture that over the years has lost its ways of soul connection that once were as natural as walking upright.  Half guidebook, half storybook, and half pure poetry, Soulcraft:  Crossing into the Mysteries of Nature and Psyche by Bill Plotkin describes his lifelong work in discovering and developing nature and the outer wilderness as mirrors for our inner nature and inner wilderness.  In Soulcraft, Bill tries to compile and present approaches to the mystery of our souls and what Mary Oliver calls ""our place in the family of things.""  Of the many fruits one can take away from the stories and practices Bill describes in Soulcraft, I think four of the juiciest are: (1) his distinction between ""spirit"" and ""soul"", (2) his approach to dreamwork, (3) his belief that soul work, while not promising any easy answers to the harsh realities of life, certainly makes life more interesting, and (4) the practices that lead to cultivating a soulful relationship to life."
books,,1.0,The larger truth,"People of all groups, ethnicities, religions, and races commit cons, steal, and such.  To paint a whole ethnic group, Gypsies (Romani folk) with the same broad brush as the few among them who commit crimes is no more valid than to call all whites ""oven tenders"" because of the Holocaust or call all corporate officers ""embezzlers"" because of Enron or to call all men as rapists because a few have done so.

books,,5.0,"page turner, heartwarming, great read","I have read quite a few memoirs lately (The Tender Bar, The year of Magical Thinking, Million Little Pieces-part memoir)and by far this was the best one I read. I love Carole Radziwell's writing style and I found her story to be gutsy, emotional and truthful. As a person who watched a loved one die of cancer before my eyes I could totally relate to her feelings of frustration, helplessness and sadness. I can say their is nothing on earth worse than watching a love on deteriorate before your eyes and not able to save them. I had no idea of the relationship between her and the Kennedy family so i was very intrigued by her personal view of the family and the friendship. I felt she wrote this book with great respect for her husbands family revealing what she deemed approriate written with integrity. This was a magnificent first book and I look forward to reading more of her work. I highly recommend this book"

books,1 of 1,4.0,Arguably Shakespeare's Greatest Comedy.,"As far as Shakesepare's comedies go, ""The Comedy of Errors"" will always be my favorite. And while this ""As You Like It"" never quite obtained the popularity of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" or ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" one probably could argue that ""As You Like It"" is the best of Shakespeare's comedies. This play contains several plots that Shakespeare cleverly intertwines and it offers a happy ending with love triumphant. But more important than the triumph of love, the theme of reconciliation carries through to virtually everyone in the story. The story begins with the sibling rivalry of Orlando and his older brother Oliver who has hoarded the family inheritence. After a brief fight, Oliver hopes that Orlando may accidentally die in a wrestling match against Charles. This is where a 2nd plot comes in. The Duke Frederick (who has a daughter Celia) has banished his older brother (the true Duke who has a daughter Rosalind). But for now, Rosalind is allowed to stay and she has made good friends with Celia. Orlando meets these 2 girls and falls into favor with Rosalind. After the wrestling match, things start to go bad. Orlando learns that his brother Oliver is planning to kill him, and Rosalind is banished. But all is not lost. Orlando takes his loyal servant Adam and flees while Rosalind (in the male disguise of Ganymede), along with Celia, and the comical Touchstone will flee to look for Rosalind's father. And here is where the play becomes mostly comical. (Good comedies can often have a sad start. ""The Comedy of Errors"" shows this well.) Moving on, we meet Rosalind's father and his crew who have made exile into a paradise. From Duke Sr's party, we meet the melancholy Jaques. But he is arguably the most interesting character in the story. (In fact, the most famous passage from this play belongs to Jaques. The 7 stages of man which end in nothing. Perhaps Macbeth took lessons from Jaques: 'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.') Duke Sr welcomes Orlando and Adam, and it isn't long before Orlando and Rosalind run into each other. Shakespeare maintains the comedy when Rosalinde keeps her male disguise on and tells Orlando he must practice wooing on him/her. Touchstone has some comical romantic moments with Audrey. And there is an interesting triangle where the shepherd Silvius loves Phebe, but Phebe loves Rosalinde (seeing only  Ganymede)! We may recall this from ""the 12th Night"" when Olivia loved Viola in her male disguise. But after this comical moment, all begins to resolve. Oliver comes on the scene and he and Celia fall in love. (So much so that Oliver is willing to reconcile with Orlando and grant him all.) The play ends with not only the reunion of Rosalind and her father, but the joyous weddings of Rosalind / Orlando, Celia /Oliver, Audrey /Touchstone, and Phebe / Silvius, but more good news comes. Celia's father mends his ways and returns all to Rosalind's father. Jaques offers the crowning touch. Despite his cynical nature, he is NOT a villain. Ironically, this hermit type man converses with more characters than anyone in the story, and while he can not take part in the play's final happiness, he DOES wish everyone well. As I said, my favorite comedy will always be ""The Comedy of Errors."" But don't make the mistake of overlooking this comedy"
books,,5.0,One of my favorites.,IT is one of my favorite Stephen King novels I've ever read.  Possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books.  It is extremely long and I must admit that I had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it.  I know it's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice.  Of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long.
books,2 of 2,5.0,Just what it advertises,This book is just what it advertises - it is good down-to-earth and practical advice for those just starting out on their teaching careers.  I've been teaching for several years but I found a good number of ideas in here to help orient our new faculty.  I have just pulled every book in the library I could find on preparing faculty to instruct and this one was the best of the entire pile.  I think it should be read by everyone just starting their teaching career.

This book was recommended by a friend and has truly changed my life. Hormones play a big part in mood, weight, fat distribution and many other things. I learned enough in this book to ask my gynecologist for a prescription to give my pharmacist, who does compounding, for hormone replacement in a cream form. I use Progesterone and Testosterone and feel much better. I was the first person my gynecologist prescribed hormonal cream for that had not gone thru menopause.

This book is so readable and covers every aspect of grief. My husband died four months ago, and I have found this book exceedingly helpful. Elixabeth put the most important step first ""To experience and express grief fully.""  There are hundreds of ways to run away from grief, but it is necessary ""to feel it to heal it."" I was given the best advice by a friend who said to ""lean into the pain."" The second choice ""To endure with patience,"" has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself. Thank you, Elizabeth for this beautiful book. I will buy it for everyone I know who loses someone dear"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent,"This book is sooo extremely informative. It explores issues relating to Muslim women from many different Islamic perspectives (non-Muslims seem to be shocked that there is actually more than one Islamic perspective!!!). Roald, a convert to Islam, critically examines specific issues from the eyes of the most important and relevant players in contemporary Islamic discourse, from Eastern and Western Muslim feminists, to the typical mainstream Muslim writers (in the West and in the Arab world), to the Wahhabi/Salafi literalists. She is honest and insightful, and she includes personal experiences and anecdotes gathered from interviewees. She also gives well cited hadeeth evidence and Quranic verse to explain where many of her subjects' views originate. She ties modern Islamic rhetoric on women's issues to the convergence of Western cultural encounters with Islam/Muslims due to colonialism and globalization, together with basic Islamic sources of knowledge (Quran and hadeeth), and with culturalized Islam in the Arab context. This book is a MUST READ for people who want to take a critical and well-informed look at the ""Women in Islam"" issue"
books,0 of 9,2.0,Great reads ruined by horrible characters,"The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Could not put it down!,"I bought this book on a lark, just to use up some Christmas gift money.  Once I got the book, I couldn't put it down!  The main character is a pissed off teenager, mad at everything, but falling in love and clueless as to what to do.  Sounds like a few teenagers I've known.  The great thing about this book is that the description of this teenager's life rings true.  The book, like the main character, is not tidy and doesn't fit into a neat little package.  The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it ended too soon"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Chain of Emtotions,"This book masyerfully unmasks the sorrows of the nation. The author is able to compose a memoir of the haunting lives of children in New York's ghettos. The fierce images of rat-infested homes, and schools filled with poisonous lead walls leave readers unable to fathom how people truly exist in such harsh conditions. Kozol addresses every area of the spectrum from the children's point of view to the political views of the country. Also presenting an array of diverse issues such as AIDs, drugs, underage prostitution, death, motives based in moral, religious beliefs, and inhuman treatment towards others to the reader. Feelings of pathos arise after hearing the accounts of the children in the area; readers feel sorrow for the children because they are stripped of their childhood. Numerous quotes and examples are given in the book, but one that particularly struck me was when Kozol asks one of the children if he knows anyone happy at all the boy candidly responds, ""Not many...Well, to tell the truth, not any who are happy for more than one day...No! Not for one day. For 15 minutes...Not any. That's no lie""(212). To honestly not know at least some form of happiness is incompressible for me and I'm sure for many others as well. By using statements made by children the author easily wins the readers pity and sympathy. Our pity soon turns to anger when he describes the lack of government support. Examples such as unsanitary hospitals, toxic incinerators, closet sized school rooms, and shabby, less then adequate housing evoke sentiments of detest towards the government's lack of aid towards these poor devastated people. But once again Kozol quickly changes our feelings to those of denial. He provides shocking statistics and first hand accounts as to how the nation sympathizes with these people for five minutes and then continue on with their lives.  It seems shocking that people would do things so cruel such as disposing of their waste in the ghetto streets. While reading, it became a necessity for me to remind myself that the events taking place were all true; this is not a cleverly composed work of fiction, though it would certainly be far more assuaging if it were."
books,17 of 36,5.0,"Standing athwart modern ""conservatism""","I found Kirk's work to be an excellant antidote to the Religious Right and Neoconservative nonsense that the media and new intellectuals pass on as ""conservatism"" today. A good place to take back the Conservative philosophy, a philosophy of tolerance, respect, fairness, and progress, from the extremists bent on Right wing ""Christian"" tyranny"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Incredible Story!! Highly recommended...the trials that man can endure are AMAZING!,"This story was incredible! Some of the things these men had to do to survive were truly inhuman and at times appalling. Even so th ebook is engaging from page 1 to the end. Amazing  what the mind can do to keep the body from dying...and what it can do to make the body give up. This book had me angry, relieved, amazed and at all times entertained. I highly recommend it!"
books,7 of 7,5.0,One of my favorite books,"Must confess my bias on this. I like games, gambling and investing. This book covers the gamut and does it well. What I found especially enjoyable was Bernstein's literate background. He spun a fascinating tale of 'The remarkable story of risk' (from the front cover) in a totally engaging way."
books,2 of 2,5.0,One of the best books for new and experienced writers.,This book has broken down all the elements that make a book a page turner - and a financial success!
books,17 of 18,4.0,The end of the Dead series.,"In December 2002, FBI Agent Shields had completed his mission in Santa Estela, Central America. He was on the docks, en route to the boat that would begin his journey back to the States, when he stumbled upon men and vehicles in the process of buying children. It was a child-slave trade obviously. As Shields pondered what he should do, his cousin (another agent) appeared and informed him that the child-slave ring would end that very night. Shields met his boat contact and went home, secure in the knowledge that his cousin's team would save the children."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Classic,"I am very annoyed that people who do not have any idea of what this book is, have the audacity to rate it. If you made the mistake of buying this book thinking it was a cookbook that is your own fault! Please don't rate Escoffiers culinary writings based on your own stupidity."
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Must for the Holidays,Looking for a perfect Holiday gift? This is it. Small and compact but with so much info and fun to read. I now know what to get my college age relatives as well as  a gift for the person who has everything. I hope it is the beginning of a series because there is more to Be Safe about than just one book

books,8 of 8,5.0,Book report by HBS Working Knowledge,"This book opens with some cheery news: ""Much that is held as common wisdom regarding how successful innovation is managed is wrong."" According to the authors, innovation does not require a company-wide revolution or mystifying transformations, nor a focus on technology or a devotion to building a ""creative culture."" In fact, not every company really needs a large quantity of innovation. Instead, there are a few requirements to implement a successful innovation program: specific tools, rules, and discipline; the right measurements and incentives; and the ability to integrate both business model innovation and technology innovation."
books,3 of 3,5.0,"A classic fantasy, too much forgotten","Lud isn't London, and Dorimare isn't England, although there are some resemblances. Dorimare is bordered by Fairyland, although these days it does its very best to ignore that fact. Two or three centuries ago, under Duke Aubrey, it was different. Trade between the two lands was thriving, and the people of Dorimare enjoyed eating fairy fruit. But the merchants rose up and drove Duke Aubrey out-he was capricious and bad for business-and now mention of Fairy is banned as indecent, and fairy fruit is so illegal that smugglers of it have to be prosecuted for smuggling silk."
books,3 of 7,2.0,Big Thick Book With Little Content: Beware!,"I have more than 15 years of project management experience. I've read this and quite a few other PMP books from cover to cover. Most of the reviews on this page sound like a propaganda to me. This book gives you the impression that it's a big book and must be covering lots of material. But this, in my opinion, is not true. It's big due to the large font and because most of the space on each page is empty."
books,2 of 2,4.0,"Setting the China scene, BUT...","This book is similar to China Shakes the World, although the latter is better written - which is also why China Shakes the World has won the 2006 FT/Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award."
books,7 of 7,5.0,This book is great,"Although there are a lot of similarities between this book and other self help books out there, like setting goals, knowing what you want, etc, this book goes over the spiritual side to getting what you want.  It gives an alternative approach to other success type books which I thought was interesting and enjoyable to read."
books,1 of 2,5.0,20th century history to savor,The history of Truman and his birth in the 1880s through WW1 & WW2 as well as the Cold War and Korea is remarkable. The evolution of a man from small town farmer to President of the United States and the weight of history thrust upon him at the expected death of FDR makes for a great read.I found the difficulties in the post WW2 era to be most interesting such as the strikes and the creation of the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan.
books,3 of 4,4.0,Have to get the next one,"A disclaimer for this book...to fully enjoy it, you really need to read Term Limits and Transfer of Power first.  There are a LOT of characters here that were in the previous two books.  Trying to digest all of them at the same time might be a little rough."
books,77 of 77,5.0,Practical Cooking for Busy Households,"I love to cook.  I love to eat good food.  But, I have a job, a preschooler, an old house, elderly relatives that need my help...the list goes on.  Life is too busy for all of us and we are all guilty of making poor food choices because of our lack of time."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Reassuring,This is the least preachy bible study I've ever read.
books,2 of 2,4.0,Irving Penn: A Pioneer,"One of the most significant photographers of the twentyith century, Irving Penn's captivating photographs throughout his career are wonderfully showcased in this book. from his humble beginnings as a graphic dsigner in the 1940's to his portraits of the native peoples from the far reaches of the world-Penn's work has had a major impact on not only the world of photography but aslo the art world as a whole. This retrospective of Penn's body of work is much more thorough than expected."
books,4 of 5,5.0,A great American travel memoir,"This book is vital and interesting, even across the gulf of the 40-odd years since it was written. Steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60's ""generation gap"" and even the far side of post-World War II industrialization and urbanization."
books,1 of 2,5.0,really nice,got it as a present for my boyfriend. he loved it. really nice cover that folds out
books,6 of 14,2.0,OK book about a very bad man.,"Kofi Annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that.  Kofi Annan: The Peacekeeper is ironic in that Annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the UN, support for Arafar, etc."
books,11 of 14,4.0,SEVIERVILLE in Child of God,"I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was &quot;WE SELL THE EARTH.&quot; C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community"
books,11 of 17,5.0,Five stars for five finger discount,"My wife's addiction to the Home Shopping Network was putting a real strain on our savings account.  All the money that we had set aside for our son's community college education was lost after a ""Sale of the Century"" on commemorative Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles plates.  Instead of buying one plate (like most people), my wife decided to get a 12-piece set (to match the 12-piece set of Bill and Hilary Clinton cutlery, I guess).  Normally, the plates wouldn't be that expensive, but these were the ones with the 14-karat gold border.  The rest, as they say, is history."
books,6 of 7,4.0,A Good Mystery In A Different Time,"Though the language is contemporary for its time (1860), and it is written in the style of a serial (thus in the author's interest to make it extend out a bit), this is a good story.  The plot device is quite inventive, the story gets better in the second half, and the final chapters are quite entertaining."
books,7 of 11,5.0,IN SEARCH OF YORK,This was the only book I could find about the slave who went to the Pacific with Lewis &amp; Clark. It was published by Colorado Associated University Press in 1985. Exellent foundation for further research on York.  very readable with good illustrations &amp; footnotes
books,0 of 4,2.0,Slow and annoying,"Brent offers a money-back guarantee at his events, where he would give a reader a dollar if they came up with his book and told them it was boring."
books,1 of 1,5.0,My favorite Crichton book,This is my favorite book by Mr. Crichton...I have read every book by him that I can find...I just found the plot to be very suspenseful and mind-bending. Granted I am 15 so maybe my knowledge of literature is not as high as some adults but this is a great read!
books,,4.0,Smokin',"The loving Italian family, smart and capable protagonist Reena Hale, compassionate and good-looking boyfriend, and sex ""off the charts"" in Blue Smoke will satisfy loyal Roberts fans.  However, if readers are looking for the afternoon delight kind story sometimes associated with Roberts, this book is not for you.  Blue Smoke is harsh.  Sadistic rape, murder, and a truly evil sociopathic character may put unsuspecting readers right off.  But after reading Blue Smoke, I have even more respect for Ms. Roberts as she shows her ability to work in yet another genre.  Except for some minor logistical problems associated with a handgun during the story's denouement, Blue Smoke works.  It shows that talented writer Nora Roberts can play with the big girls of this genre (Reichs, Gerristen, Slaughter, early Cornwell, et al). I hope Ms. Roberts keeps Reena Hale on hand for a few more adventures. Good job, NR"
books,7 of 8,5.0,Renewal of Indian wars,"Margaret Coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and describes the Arapahoe customs in wonderful detail.  In this installment, Father O'Malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians has been re-ignited, and that dead Indians can be found on an ancient battle ground.  When Father O'Malley goes to investigate, he discovers three dead Shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles. Things heat up when the young Shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends.  Vicky Holden, the other main character in the series, has entered into a law partnership with Adam Lone Eagle, and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling.  Vicky wants to defend Frankie Montana, who is a suspect in the murders, and Adam tries to persuade her not to take Frankie as a client.  As always, author Coel creates a wonderful setting and characters, and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series."
books,,5.0,I wish I could have met him,"Like another reviewer, my interest in history is quite new. The author's presentation of John Adams left me wanting to know much more of this great man. David McCullough's excerpting of Adams' professional and personal writings exposed a passionate man of deep convictions and possessed of an intellect and idealism beyond his generation. While Mr. Adams was acutely aware of and deplored his own ego, he, at the same time was critical of his own limitations. Even with this conflict, Adams could still say, ""I thank God that he gave me stubborness when I am right."""
books,5 of 5,5.0,"Concise, precise, convincing; that's Richard Feynman","Richard Phillips Feynman is showing physics with an extremly clear view, providing all essentials of classical and quantum physics. His lectures` are the best an undergraduate can read to understand. The nobel laurate from 1965 was able to explain everything in his own very intuitive way of thinking. He is writing precise and shows a combination of experimental and theoretical physics which is searching still for competition. Sometimes, I thought, even Albert Einstein was not able to to describe thing smore simple. Very inventive are his ideas on the General Theory of Relativity in Volume two. It should be emphasized, that his physical intuition was leading him to the very important description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in chapter fifteen of volume two. He shwos, that the vector potential must be a real field. All in all, Feynman`s work should be read more than once by every physicist. I personally know men, who are experts in fields like superconductivity or gravity and still are consulting for these Feynman lectures sometimes"

books,8 of 8,5.0,Oft Quoted; Seldom Read,"I'm a bit surprised to be the first reviewer of this classic. When I began my career in Wildlife Management over 30 years ago I was surprised at how many people quoted this work, but admitted they had not actually read it. I had read it in graduate school and was amazed at how prescient Leopold had been. He accurately predicted where Wildlife Management would go in the future and what would be necessary for success. (As a side note, Leopold used the two word term `Wild Life' meaning plants, animals, the soil; i.e. ecosystems. The term was changed to one word by the Wisconsin Legislature and defined as certain animals only.)"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Wait For The Paperback,"Good, but not great.  Stewart tries a little too hard in this book.  It's still good, and I would recommend reading it, but it's not worth reading at the hardcover price"
books,3 of 6,5.0,Now I get it.,This book has contributed to my understanding of living in the present moment more than anything else I've read. In fact I've read it several times and plan on reading it again. Highly recommended to anyone seeking higher consciousness
books,3 of 4,5.0,Great Book,"The first hand telling of WWII by a retired 4 star general. Detailed battle discriptions and analysis, and amazing individual encounters. Possibly THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!"
books,8 of 8,5.0,Charming - a tradition with a new paper twist,"Clement Moore's ""Night Before Christmas"" gets an almost origami pop-up treatment engineered to be as sophisticated as it is adorable.  Magically designed, value-priced and thoughtfully executed it is sturdy but it really is ""art"" and not for very young children without supervision."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Too repetetive,"I think Mr. Kiyosaki became indeed rich with his ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" series and rightly so. However this particular book is just repeating of the same ideas I have seen in his other books with not much new information related to investing as the title suggested. In any case I  do recommend reading the original title ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!"""
books,4 of 6,2.0,Parents - Please Read This Review,I really wanted to like this book. I bought it to read with my 9-year old because she and I are so interested in Pirate stories. I am also a fan of Dave Barry and so thought this would be fun for both her and I.
books,13 of 17,5.0,I cannot stop thinking about this book,"Three-fourths of the way through this book, I am blown away by what I have read so far. It is NOT an easy book to read, especially for someone like me, who has led a pretty sheltered life. Although I knew about 'slavery'  and &quot;civil rights' and thought myself to be pretty educated, this book  makes me realize that I have known NOTHING of the real world,the one that  African-Americans, and other oppressed people, live in. I really appreciate  the chance that this book has given me to see the world and live the day  through their eyes. I find myself thinking about it all the time--do blacks  really think of me like THAT? I wonder. Do I ever do THIS unconsiously?  This is the kind of book that makes you ache for company to discuss it; to  debate it; to share. If you belong to a book club, this should be your next  read! I cannot say enough about how it has stirred my emotions, my  imagination, my shame, and my sadness"
books,4 of 4,5.0,The Best Office Reference Guide,"This book was required reading for a college course; however, had I found the book on my own I would have felt I struck gold!

books,6 of 6,4.0,Mr. Lynch Shares More of His Expertise...,"When Peter S. Lynch speaks, wise investors will listen.  This book covers the famous fund manager's career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to '90, and post career into '92.  It's far more introspective than ""One Up On Wall Street"" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose.  For example, there isn't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former.  My belief is that the reader would do best by reading ""One Up On Wall Street"" first and follow up with this title, as its the newer of the two, regardless."
books,,4.0,More dreadful fun,"Once again the Baudelaire Orphans find themselves off to another place to live with another sinister guardian.  Mr. Poe drops the orphans off at a boarding school where all of the buildings resemble gravestones.  The rules at the school are horrible and the evil Vice Principal forces the students to live in an even more horrible shack with crabs that live on the floor and bite the orphans' toes.  However the orphans finally make some friends at the school and for a time it seems as though this school will be better than the other places they have lived.  However, Count Olaf, in disguise, gets hired as the school's new gym teacher.  Once again, Olaf finds a way to sneak past the people in charge and trap the Baudelaire's in another trap."

He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October"

books,3 of 3,5.0,"Aging, Changing & Dying & The Soul Consciousness","Here is a book continuing the path of help and service to others, except this time Ram Dass, from a stroke, has more personal experience in the receiving end of helpful service, which makes his book that much more meaningful."
books,,4.0,Good movie - good book,"Check out the 2002 John Malkovich version of Ripley's Game.  A marvelous interpretation of an ""older, wiser, more talented"" Mr. Ripley.  Much more than the Damon TTMR, this one made me want to read the books.  And what a great read ""Game"" is.  Very cinematic in the violence and suspense"
books,2 of 2,4.0,Mystic River,"Dennis Lehane's Mystic River is a suspenseful, mind-teasing thriller that keeps the reader geussing and wanting to read more.  One of three friends gets kidnapped and molested as a child, but manages to escape four days later.  Twenty-five years after that, the friends have grown apart, and one of the men's daughters has been mysteriously murdered.  This tragic event brings the three boys back together again and shows that the past can never be hidden or forgotten.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to be kept geussing with a suspenseful murder mystery"

books,2 of 3,5.0,Take work from your strengths,"A fantastic book of weekness and strength, a human being is a mixture of weekness and strength equally and those among us who take work with thier strength come out successful regardless of the profession they are involve in, they can focus on thier strength rather than weakness, positive attitude regardless all the adversaries of a life. I learned a great deal out of this Marcus Buckingham book and I strongly recommend to the book lovers don't miss this one"
books,8 of 9,4.0,"Deep content, but terrible style","First, I should note that The Wealth Of Networks is terribly edited. Given that Benkler thanked his editor for his Herculean work at the beginning of the book, I can only imagine the state it started in; as it is, it ended with glaring grammatical errors, including using ""effect"" when he meant ""affect"" and ""wave"" when he meant ""waive"". (I'll provide specific examples sometime tomorrow.) Editing, apparently, is a craft that is only noticed in its absence. I didn't realize this until I read The Wealth of Networks. By the time I was done with the book, I was copyediting every page."
books,10 of 11,5.0,A must-have in your job market arsenal,"This book was recommended to me by several people as I interviewed hiring managers, HR personnel, senior-level employees, and others for my own book on the job market.  By all accounts, my own included, 201 Best Questions is comprehensive, helpful, and tactical, an important read when one is preparing for an interview.  It is not an all-inclusive resource, only interview-targeted, but for what it is, the book is top-notch"
books,5 of 6,5.0,Read it again,"I came to this book with the advantage of having sat under Dr. Mulholland in 4-5 courses including 2 on Biblical exegesis.  The title of this book &quot;Shaped by the Word&quot;, is 100% representative of his view of scripture.  Mulholland very effectively teaches us that we should approach the scriptures with our hearts and our minds full expecting to be shaped by the work of God through His Word.  Mulholland effectively communicates to us that when we always lead our study of scripture with reason our hearts will not be formed as God intends"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Opens up door to success,"This book has made a huge difference in the way I react, work, play and think about things that come up all the time.  The highlighter flowed throughout and my inner lightbulb glowed regularly when reading this timeless marvel"
books,13 of 17,5.0,Brilliant if outdated attempt to merge physics and theology,"Tipler says that he used to be an unquestioning atheist, but his work in quantum cosmology has brought him to the conclusion that there is a physically justifiable theory of how ""God"" and ""immortality after death"" might make sense. I only skimmed the book, but I have to say that, as a physicist, I was surprised to find the quality of his arguments to be a lot better than I expected."
books,0 of 1,5.0,A Must Have!,"What a great read! Bringing Down the House is a superb story that reads like a fast-paced action thriller, but the kicker is that everything in this story really happened. Once i started reading this story, I couldn't put it down until the last page. I truly believe that its a must have for any serious fan of gambling and/or blackjack. It will inspire and give hope to the hopeless blackjacker such as myself. I doubt that you will be disappointed"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Feist does it again,"Silverthorn by Raymond Feist in the 3rd (or 2nd depending on how you read Magician) book in the Riftwar saga. With this installment Feist picks up where he left off. The best thing about books like this is the author doesn't need to invest as much time and energy setting up the players, as we already know who they are and what they stand for."
books,5 of 11,5.0,Wonderful!,"This book is beautiful, full of great and fantastic recipes - and most of all encouraging -- Ms. Goin tells us that we can do it - don't be intimidated...so I made the ricotta gnocchi, several of the pork and chicken dishes - outstanding!  Buy this book"
books,5 of 6,4.0,Calling into question America's Imperial ambitions,"I doubt this book would have garnered so much attention had not Hugo Chavez waived it front of the UN assembly decrying US imperial ambitions.  The book quickly soared to the top of most bestselling lists, and briefly topped amazon book sales.  I well imagine Noam Chomsky had to crack a smile, as it turns out that people do take notice when someone questions American authority, and this is what this book is all about."
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Good, But...","I am a sucker for a story in a foreign country.  LeCarre is an great writer, and made the African scene very realistic.  He paints a very clear political picture of Kenya that is probably not far from the real political situation in many African nations.  As a missionary in a third world country, I can understand how paternalism and racism sneaks into foreigner's minds.  The Western characters in Constant Gardener exhibit extreme paternalistic attitudes toward Africa and though ugly and obviously wrong, many foreigners use these attitudes to deal with their own culture shock.  The hero of the story had no problem bonding with the people, which is probably the reason for her healthy attitude.  When foreigners spend time and build relationships with the people of the country, they will bond with these people and begin seeing them for what they are- equals.  But the majority of the characters in this book spend their time in their Western homes, only seeing nationals who are servants.  Are these Westerners bad people?  Probably not.  But they have succumbed to paternalism and racism because of their lack of contact and relationships with the people."

books,1 of 2,5.0,A fantastic compelation of vaguely interrelating--yet highly applicaple--tales.,"To be truthful, I had never been a big fan of Salinger's before I read this book.

books,13 of 15,5.0,A masterpiece of economic history that is as relevant as ever sixty years on,"Although this book was published in 1944, the same year as Hayek's THE ROAD TO SERFDOM, it remains as relevant as ever.  Some say that it is dated and it is true that many of the historical references are not the ones that would spring to mind today, but the critique of the myth of the self-regulating free market remains as relevant and to-the-point as ever.  One of the main targets of his book was the Vienna school of economics, the central figures of which were Ludwig von Mises and F. A. Hayek.  What Polanyi does is help one to see how hopelessly na�ve and ahistorical many of their central assumptions are.  Though one might question some of the details of Polanyi's thesis, especially regarding the gold standard the causes of the two world wars, he makes two incredibly powerful arguments about the myth of the self-regulating market to which proponents of that theory have offered no convincing reply.

books,2 of 2,5.0,Emma Brown,"Clare has created a polished work from scanty beginnings. It is not, despite the blurbs, Bronte's voice -- it is certainly a modern work -- but it is a stimulating read nonetheless. The characters are well-developed and sympathetic, and drew me in to the mystery. The plot is well-timed, adding in new facets just as they are needed."
books,,5.0,WOW!,"I picked up this book at random at the airport for something to read on my flight.  I am so glad that I came across it.  I can't wait to read John Grisham's new book about a similar case in Ada.  Sounds to me like they need to get a new DA and take a better look at this case.  I would imagine that his career is pretty much ruined now though, heh.  The girl on the first page mentioned that she was Donna Denice Haraway's niece and that Tommy and Karl did commit the crime and that this book is full of lies.  With all due respect to that girl, as I know her family has gone through a lot....but she was only 4 years old when it happened.  There isn't honest closure if the real murderer is still walking.  Who knows how many others he has hurt. Who knows, maybe it was the same guy that killed the other girl, the one in Grisham's book"
books,,4.0,A  Look Back at Our Beginning,"At the crest of a hill on 150th Street, in Jamaica, Queens, a simple unobtrusive boulder with a bronze inscription announces that it was at that spot the Battle of Long Island was fought in 1776. The British had travelled throughout the night probably along what is now Hillside Avenue to take the American rear by surprise at dawn. The fact that the plaque sits on someone's front lawn, and is a brief ten-minute walk from my apartment is a reminder that before the asphalt and brick that predominate the landscape, our nation was taking its first, precarious steps toward nationhood."

Was this supposed to be a textbook for the class, or a nonfiction novel?  Well, it didn't take long for me to get hooked on Kozal and everything he's written since.  Amazing Grace is very powerful and the most basic level; it introduces the reader to children directly affected by poverty and shows you in no uncertain way how their socio-economic status cripples their ability to learn and flourish into adults.  It doesn't mence words, so be ready to get a little emotional when reading this.  If you have any interest in class and education, you have to read Kozal.  If you're going to read any Kozal, you have to start here"
books,,4.0,Strategies for dealing with the opposite sex,"This book not only explains the differences between men and women but also gives strategies to each sex for dealing with those differences. For example men and women have different values. Men tend to value competence and accomplishments while women tend to value relationships. Women tend to express their caring by offering unsolicited advice that is often causes men to feel incompetent. Women need to express how they feel about their problems, while men interpret this as blaming them for their problems. Men often need time alone to solve their problems while women interpret this as not caring. If everyone practiced the methods in this book the sexes would get along much better. The book, however, is at times dry reading."
books,2 of 2,4.0,"Touching, but only a partial portrait","George Englund's memoir of Marlon Brando is that, a memoir and far from a full-scale biography.  It is a touching remembrance, filled with genuine affection for its subject, but not so much as to make the author blind to the shortcomings and warts of the greatest of all our film actors.  In its affection it is a welcome departure from some of the more vicious tabloid-like portrayals of Brando--Peter Manso's biography comes to mind. At its best Englund's work is distinguished by some really beautiful interludes and gripping passages--his description of visiting his own absentee father after decades is especially moving.  One senses that Englund believed he was privy to the whole of Brando, the insider of all insiders.  His graphic description of Brando's last night is almost an exercise in trying to prove to himself, and us, how close he was to Brando.  And it is a rare occurrence of Englund going perhaps too far.  But for all that he was allowed to see, it is also apparent to the reader, if not to Englund himself, that Georgie was kept at arms length from various facets and compartments of his famous subject.  There are dramatic and notable gaps in the book, and one gets the feeling that Englund's import as a macho and intellectual sidekick grew once Wally Cox died.  It is perhaps too much to ask any single book to cover the whole of Brando--the subject is simply too complex.  But this is a useful glimpse inside at least some aspects of Brando's life."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Entertaining, funny, well put together","Whatever you think of the man, Bono is something else. Here we get some genuine insight into what makes this extraordinary individual tick. The series of dialogues between the Irish singer and old friend French writer Michka Assayas covers just about everything you can think of with intelligence and humour. At one point they discuss that these conversations themselves may be some kind of therapy for Bono since the relatively recent death of his father."

A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  ""nontraditional"" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company.

books,3 of 3,5.0,Simple But Immensely Powerful,"What an awesome book. Some of the greatest things in life come in the smallest packages.  This book explains how thought leads to attitude leads to action leads to habit leads to character which leads to destiny.  It is my belief that this simple but powerful truth is one of the most overlooked principles in the world.  This book is literally a gold mine of awesome aphorisms and quotes including one of the greatest statements of all time: ""Men do not attract what they are but that which they are"".  This is one the most important pieces of writing to grace the planet earth.  I do not leave home without it"

books,7 of 7,5.0,Mr. SportsTelevision Meets Mr. Boxing,"Mr. Kindred is a wonderful storyteller in this very readable dual biography of two controversial men: Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell. Like ""Beyond Glory"" -2005- by David Margolick (which tells another story of a white man and a black man linked by history in the 1930's), ""Sound and Fury"" is a history of a later era, the chaotic 1960's, and a history of two outsiders. Mr. Margolick makes clear that their relationship was less of a friendship and more of a partnership -- the two of them never hung out socially but each saw the other as a genius in their domain who could further their respective careers. This book is a wonderful introduction to their lives for any reader who was born after the time when Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell had already come and gone, and as a reminder to those of us who were there"

I've heard about giving birth, the suffering after birth, breastfeeding and your first few weeks of parenting from various people, but no one tells these stories like Jenny.

Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the ""Acknowledgments"" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published.

books,1 of 1,4.0,Hurrah For Old Washy!,"1776 is a nice general read on the events corresponding to the first significant year of the Revolution.  David McCullough is a nice story teller, but he is not a military historian.  Such was not the intent of this book.  What I like is that its a nice, fast moving narrative on the 1776 campaign.  Thank god we don't have another rehash of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, with Franklin, Jefferson et. al. doing all their careful draghts.  McCullogh, the voice of History on Public TV, was sensible not to drag the reader through that well known territory again."
books,0 of 5,2.0,Surprising Bad,"By the other reviews here, you'd think this was a marvelous sports-war book fullof interesting, endearing characters performing in extraordinary times. In fact, the book reads like a story from a friendly uncle who carries on and on about people you don't know who he hasn't made you care about. There's little to bond you to the characters, and much of the book explains the not particularly interesting game-by-game season of a Wisconsin football team. In the preface the autor relates how his father's life inspired the book, and this feels like something someone would write for the benefit of the narrow group of people who experienced it, not the general public"

books,4 of 5,2.0,The Money Culture is US?,"This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel"

Skip lives over the garage on the estate and is a hard worker. Mrs. Blessing constantly watches him as he moves around her property.  Because she doesn't really trust anyone, she uses binoculars to make sure he does his chores and keeps busy. He is aware of her spying, but doesn't hold it against her."

books,2 of 3,5.0,One great read,"This is much more than a story about a man born in a woman's body who then went through life threatening surgery and alot of sole searching to become the person he is today. It is also a study in determination and perserverance.  I saw Dhillon Khosla on the View and immediately bought his book.  I could not believe that he was born a woman.  When I received his book I read it through in one night (something new for me) because I had to know the whole story.  While this book will interest those who feel they too are trapped in the wrong body,it is also the story of an incredible journey full of sandtraps and brick walls.  The intimate story is told with intellectual honesty and is an excellent read"

books,10 of 12,4.0,Thoughtful anectodes and insightful observations.,"As the white father of black/white  inter-racial children, I needed to better understand some of the reasons and motivations driving racist behavior.  Shipler's book took me through several on-point situations that have arisen in my life and enabled me to understand how  &quot;color-blind&quot; people can continue to discriminate through their actions and deeds. Shipler's ability to observe and report without scathing judgemental attacks enhances the book's credibility.  Our copy of the book now has many dog-eared pages that will be shared with friends, teachers and others.   My decision to purchase the book is an interesting story:  Our third grade daughter, returning from school recess with play-tossed hair, was told by her white teacher,&quot;Gee, your hair looks like Don King's!&quot;.  Even though our little girl had no idea who Don King was, we confronted the teacher  about this inappropriate comment.  The teacher was insulted that we could assume she was biased in any way.  That evening, NPR interviewed Mr. Shipler, and the book was ordered from Amazon.com within the hour.Shipler's book points out that many of us are convinced we are not racist or biased, however, our upbringing and the input we have received living in a racist country leaves many of us with residual habits that are percieved by others as racist ways.  These are very difficult habits or attitudes to change, however, his book should enable many readers to anticipate and prevent behavior that may be interpreted as insulting by those of different colors or cultures"

These novels relate the stories of four young ambient mages:  Sandrilene fa Toren, Daja Kisubo, Trisana Chandler and Briar Moss.  In the Circle of Magic quartet, these youngsters were rescued from distressing situations by the great mage Niklaren Goldeye, who recognized their talents and arranged for them to be trained at Winding Circle.  Living together in Discipline Cottage, they learned to control and apply their inherent magics and developed very close relationships.  These mages were granted their Medallions at the most unusual age of thirteen."
books,9 of 9,5.0,Informative and entertaining for movie lovers,"Agee on Film, part of Martin Scorsese's wonderful new series of great film books from the past, is a really enjoyable read. It contains a lot of interesting reviews of classic Hollywood films by an articulate, witty  writer, who himself wrote the screenplays to some great films, like Night  of the Hunter. I love the way that the essays in this book are both  thoughtful and direct. He has important things to say about what some films  suggest about human nature and society, but at other times he's quick and  to the point. Agee writes at the beginning that he thinks everyone is an  &quot;amateur&quot; when it comes to films, because what matters the most  is not what you know but how a movie affects you; I like that quality in  him. He isn't so pretentious that he can't admit when a movie just doesn't  move him. He writes in a really down-to-earth way, but his reviews aren't  simplistic or rushed, like many of the reviews I read today. Some of my  favorite parts of this book are the essays where he quickly gives his take  on a bunch of films, writing funny though sometimes harsh one-line quips  (for example: &quot;several tons of dynamite were set off in this movie,  none of it under the right people&quot;). This book is especially  informative and entertaining for movie fans, but also would be useful as  instruction on writing about art. Really, though, it should be fun to read  for just about anyone"

A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction ""The War of the Worlds"". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,""The War of the Worlds"" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good."
books,3 of 6,2.0,I would like a different ending...,"I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth"

books,8 of 8,5.0,Beyer's third entry is as indispensable as the first two,"Reading Andrew Beyer is at once informative and entertaining, which anything on handicapping has no excuse not being.  While his first book introduced speed figures, and his second mixed the application of them with an appreciation of other aspects of handicapping, this book revisits the holistic approach - always emphasizing speed figures - in an era when everyone has access to more information than ever, and many even know how to use it.  What makes reading Beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see, vividly, the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches, in the stories - one might call them lessons - he recounts (the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing).  Beyer, like Bill James, is a scientist, and thinks like one, to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides, and making the same old mistakes.  People like Beyer and Steve Davidowitz are largely responsible for the ever-escalating arms race which parimutuel bettors are fighting amongst themselves.  It's a wonderful game, but if you don't want to get left behind, better read this"
books,4 of 5,5.0,An Excellent Handbook for Office Workers,"If you are looking for a great informative handbook to keep available at your desk in the office, I recommend How 9 Handbook.  This is by far an excellent handbook to have.  How 9 handbook gives you information on grammar usage, memos, reports, and business documents. The numbers listed on the front of the book, helps in finding the material you need easily.  Clark &amp; Clark hit a home run with this book.  Also, if you need a little refresher course to enhance your skills, I recommend the How 9 Workbook.  Try them both for yourself!!   Every office worker should have one"
books,,5.0,The Chef of Kings,"August Escoffier was known as ""The king of chefs and the chef of kings"". This book is indispensible to anyone who is serious about the culinary arts. Escoffier defined the benchmark for classic French cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots, much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music.  You can find essences of classic French cooking in even the lowliest diner fare."

books,16 of 23,2.0,Interesting theory...circular logic,"I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest.  Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially ""alive."" 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one ""super being"" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the ""omega point."" 6) The omega point, via its ""all knowledge of all things"" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth.  Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated.  Thus we will again be ""alive"" as these ""beings"" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all.  The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions.  It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist.  PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in  the last chapter admits to being an aetheist.  (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist?"
books,6 of 19,1.0,I have considered using this book as punnishment!,"This is, by far, the worst book I have EVER been forced to read. One star is too much. The title of this book, ""The culture of education"" leads the reader to believe that the author knows something about education. He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. ""Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection."" What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as ""immutable,"" Pontogenetically,"" and ""Hermeneutic."" If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell"

books,1 of 1,5.0,An Evolution of Civilizations,"This book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13,000 years across the continents.  Diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume.  The impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from New Guinea named Yali.  Yali's question was, ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?"""
books,14 of 14,5.0,This is an amazing book!,"""For you,"" one of the characters in Jennifer Gilmore's debut novel tells his sons, ""I promise you a golden country.""  And in the 1920s in New York, the possibilities America seems to offer its new immigrants truly do appear golden, endless.  Joseph works as a door-to-door salesman, all the while slaving away in bathtubs at home, trying to invent the perfect cleaning product.  Frances translates her neighbors' Yiddish letters into a new language - English - for them to send back to Europe for the family left behind.  Meanwhile, Solomon falls in with gangsters, bringing shame to his family.  All the while, babies are born, inventions are perfected, dreams slowly expand - with no less than Irving Berlin, the invention of the television, Mae West and the 1939 World's Fair as backdrops.  With her meticulous knowledge of 1920s - 1950s American life and Grace Paley-esque gift for dialogue, Jennifer Gilmore has crafted a grand, glittering novel that is universal in its themes of family heartbreak, hope and redemption.  Golden Country is the best, most seductive book I've read this year"
books,8 of 8,4.0,Invisible Cities worth reading at least once,"I was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good detox-read.  To me the book was far from the brainless entertainment I was hoping for.  In fact, Invisible Cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublia Khan.  At first I was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities.  Through Calvino's use of symbolism I began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations.  This could have been the first time I really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams."

books,11 of 13,4.0,Great entry level course on horror writing,"I've been writing since I was 15 but I've lacked the initiative and  experience to finish a story, now that I've read Writing Horror I've done  the exercises and finished a few stories.  I found the sections on the  seven steps of plotting and the five ways to open a story immensely  helpful.  The exercises and advice are geared towards short story writing  although there's a few helpful hints about book length fiction.  Throughout  the book Van Belkom stresses how hard the publishing industry is, only  those who stick it out will make it in this business.  Also of note, being  a fellow Canadian it's refreshing to see a writing book told from the  perspective of a Canadian author.  Use this book to write a story and Renni  Browne's Self Editing For Fiction Writers to edit it into print.  I can't  recommend this book enough"

books,1 of 3,5.0,Many points of inspiration,"This book isn't meant to be read from cover to cover (it's size is already a source of intimidation), but picked up from time to time, to surprise, to inspire, to entertain, to stimulate. A collection so worth the money"
books,1 of 3,4.0,Gobsmacking fun,"Read this novel for the exquisitely crafted prose.  The sentences are understated, spare, austere, yet luscious.  Unfortunately, the story itself is skeletal and the main characters with the exception of Aldred Leith thinly sketched.  Also, all the characters think and speak in the same spare, luscious voice - which is perhaps believable for a war veteran of 33, but hardly for a 17 year old girl and her teenage brother.  No matter how precocious they may be, teenagers don't have enough life experience to utter the wise sayings these munchkins do."
books,2 of 44,5.0,Review,"I like typing.  I like seeing my words in print on the internet.  I have a lot of time to waste.  But all in all, it is a good book that is in ok shape for its age and was at a good price."
books,12 of 12,5.0,More love than squalor,"How I wish this book had been around for the many years I taught ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""Franny &amp; Zooey"" to my high school students. I read half of ""Love and Squalor"" on my feet at a bookstore; I couldn't stop reading long enough to buy it until the place was closing -- 14 gifted writers responding to their experiences with not only &quot;Catcher&quot; but the whole scanty Salinger cannon. How I wish there had been 28! The writings range from the good to the extraordinary -- I particularly loved Charles D'Ambrosio's beautiful piece about suicide and &quot;crappy, broken-down families&quot; (and can that phrase please replace ""dysfunctional""?), John McNally's insightful observations on the fabulous minor characters in &quot;Catcher&quot; and Karen E. Bender's lovely literary 'first kiss' with Holden. Best of all, the book has introduced me to these three wonderful writers, all of them new to me. After reading ""Catcher"" more than thirty times over the years, thank you all for making it new to me again"
books,,5.0,Unanticipated Anne Shirley Back In Action!,"Red haired with a flaming temper, the phenomenal Anne Shirley is back in her 2nd book! Marilla, a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing Anne up (when she was an orphan) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins, Davy and Dora Keith. Anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble. Davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes: like making his sister Dora walk the pig fence! Davy??s idea of fun includes violence and humor ?V but only for himself. The girls have to teach Davy manners, which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy. Anne??s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again, but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world. At school, she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students, especially Paul Irving, this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen. He brings her flowers and calls her ??Sweet Teacher??. Her friendship with striking Gilbert Blythe (ex-enemy for calling her hair ??carrots??) has grown, but what is Gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant? Has Diana (her bosom friend) finally grown up? I really enjoyed this book because it talks about Anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever. I simply couldn??t put it down because after every page, Anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger. My mom keeps telling me to go and do work but I cannot stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written. I like the others in this series also.Thank you L.M. Montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life!~~ Referring to the special collectors editio"

He has creative ideas about working your circles, having productive social gatherings, networking properly and always seek out to meet someone new"
books,6 of 9,5.0,REVIEW OF AVI SHLAIM'S THE IRON WALL BY JOHN CHUCKMAN,"Let me start by advising that this is a dry book to read, so it is not for the average reader of narrative history. But its meticulous scholarship makes it an indispensable book about affairs in the Middle East."
books,12 of 22,5.0,This is a GREAT read for any dog person/mystery buff!,Ms. Conant constantly amazes me with her ability to weave dog info into mystery.  Anyone who has ever shown a dog had had to deal with a gossipy trainer/handler/owner and few wouldn't like to take a pair of shears to one of them as well!  I adore this book and highly suggest you get a copy
books,1 of 1,5.0,The Secret Life of Bees,"One of the best books ever!!!!  I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over.  I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair.  Different genre, but also very entertaining!  I have become an overnight, true fan of this author"
books,1 of 3,1.0,Should be from bad to worse,"Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the ""great"" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much"
books,,5.0,Foundation Franklin,"I have read this book twice and I loved it.  Mowat wrote as if the tug was a living thing.  It was wonderful.  I actually cried at the end when Franklin came into the harbor with barely any power left and covered entirely with ice, thus ending her life.  The people who captained Franklin intriqued me as well.  In the book they were the only ones that really cared for her"
books,6 of 6,5.0,Very Informative,"This book not only provides all the tools for a well-balanced and in-depth science/technology based curriculum, but it is also quite informative on it's own, and provides answers to many of the questions posed in other classes on a daily basis"

books,2 of 2,5.0,I can't believe I read the whole thing...,...Boy is my brain stuffed.
books,18 of 19,5.0,NEW DEFINITION OF CONCIOUSNESS,"This collection of essays examines how thoughts and emotions affect our bodies and the bodies of others at a distance.  It is an insightful look at the relationship between science and ""unscientific"" topics like prayer, love, laughter, work, creativity, dreams and more, an examination of consciousness and spirituality in medicine. Everybody knows that something vital is missing in modern allopathic medicine - the role of the human mind. The author points out the deep level of ignorance within science about the origin, function and destiny of human consciousness. But at last we are moving toward a vision of consciousness that liberates the mind from its identification with the physical brain and body. Of course, the implications for medicine are vast. He refers to the ideas of Jung, Ken Wilber, Erwin Schrdinger, David Bohm and Rupert Sheldrake and makes a valid case for the fact that our power to heal and be healed extends beyond our physical bodes. The essays fall into the three categories Meaning, Mind and Nonlocality, and the book concludes with a bibliography, a section on sources and an index. This is a classic and I recommend it to all who are interested in holistic or spiritual healing and those want to take responsibility for their own health"
books,0 of 2,2.0,"Coulda, shoulda been 100 pages shorter... For speed readers only.","While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a ""quick, easy read"". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers)."
books,1 of 3,4.0,Gabaldon Redeemed,"I was very disappointed with Gabaldon's previous book, The Fiery Cross, and had a hard time getting through it.  It didn't feel fun, exciting or sexy, as her previous books had.  But I picked up this new book anyway and am VERY glad that I did.  It was a fast read, didn't get bogged down, had enjoyable and interesting characters.  Can't wait to get the next book in the Lord John series.  Highly recommend."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Best of Nora,"First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read"

That's because we've been brainwashed by the generations before us to believe that we must either be workaholics or stay-at-home mom.

books,7 of 31,1.0,An Absolute Waste of Precious Trees,"I truly feel sorry for Pynchon, knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life.  By all means, if you want to read it, get it from the library as I strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery.  Does anyone really care that a man's sexual episodes predict German V rockets falling on England?  Is it really important to World Literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from?  The so-called Intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same Great Thinkers that believe Ulysses by James Joyce is the best novel of all time.  I would rather read the worse writing of de Balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels.  Both these ""novels"" are truly ""sound and fury .... signifying nothing."""

I felt the same thrills and laughed at the same humor as the other books.  It brought to life more of the original spirit of the first book and the idea behind the series then the last two books.  It is another fantastic read from Colfer, but all this being said, it just seems to be getting repetitive.  There are no new characters of interest, and the characters aren't developing all that much for a series with four books.  I am still unsure about getting the next one.

But for the most part, sequels suck.  The opposite is true in law school support texts.  I borrowed the 2nd edition of this book from a friend and found it to be utter crap (think crap on the level of the third Austin Powers or The Mummy Returns).  It was almost as if Glannon, during a celebration over the success of his Civ Pro E&E success, got hammered and wrote Torts E&E 1st and 2nd Eds in a drunken stupor.  It seems, though, that for the 3rd Ed. he either ran out of alcohol or got an editor.  It's still not Civ Pro E&E, which single handedly rescued me from oblivion (and likely suicide) in that course, but it is definitely worth having"

This book takes the practitioner and seeker by the hand and guides them step-by-step through the dragon realms. The only thing this book lacked were creative visualizations. I also did not like how Conway required so many tools that were unattainable for rituals (ie. sword, staff, wand), although it may help to focus energy and create the 'mood'. You do not really need all these tools, for dragon magick, they can be easily substituted. In addition, just a reminder that you do not earn a dragon's trust with fancy tools."
books,6 of 17,2.0,Title of Book is a Misnomer,"The book, ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" is a gross misnomer.  At best, the book should be entitled ""A Good Personal Finance Guide"".  If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed.  The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all.  Way overstated with the title!"
books,16 of 22,1.0,"Not a fan, I can't understand why he is so popular","I am not a fan of Robert Kiyosaki.  I find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense.  While he introduces some worthwhile ideas, I don't think he develops them enough to be useful."
books,1 of 4,5.0,This was a good read!,"I really like the Characters in this book 3 girls raised as sisters Laura- Rich Girl parents own several hotels around the world. Katie- Parents Died and is a cousin of Laura's parents take her in after her parents traggic death. Then there is Margo- the daughter of the house keeper her father died in a boating accident lost at sea when she was 4 and they moved to America from Ireland. Laura, Katie, and Margo were raised as sisters and were best friends and they each have their own struggles and dreams. Laura marries young in life to a man whom both of her friends and her brother Josh dislike. Katie goes to Harvard After she graduates a year early. And Margo's mom is pressuring her to go to Harvard with Katie but instead runs off to hollywood and Europe to become a model against her moms and Josh's wishes. Margo returns 10 years later life in shambles who wil help her pick up the pieces to her broken carreer and overdue bills. This is a great book I read it in 24 hours"
books,6 of 14,1.0,"Over Rated, Unussually Boring","Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades"
books,6 of 7,5.0,Great selection!,"I received this book as a gift and at first I thought 100,000 names would be too many to look through, but the lists really helped me narrow things down. Plus, my husband and I had a lot of fun flipping to random pages and seeing what we'd find!"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Loved it!,I have never laughed out loud so much when reading a book.  I had to wipe away tears several times I was laughing so hard.  It is great for moms because we can relate to so much of what she writes
books,21 of 23,5.0,I Rate and Compare World History Atlas Books,"As a reader I like to have quick reference books at my finger tips including a new version of the Oxford English Dictionary about 3500 pages long - that I use almost daily. So I decided to add a ""history atlas"". In the process of doing my research I read the other amazon.com reviewers and then made three trips to two large book stores to actually look at the books and get a better feel for which was the best. I ended up buying the Oxford Atlas of World History. Here are my picks and rankings."
books,,5.0,Thrilling,"""The Andromeda Strain"" may be an antique in science fiction, having been published in 1969, but that hardly diminishes its excellence.  The caliber of Michael Crichton's research is such that I still found the technology and science in the book impressive (though the computers were obviously dated) despite the book's age.  The plotline is thrilling, and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy, most are equally fascinating.  I was slightly disappointed by the ending; however, the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it"
books,2 of 4,4.0,Quite A Romp,"BARFLY is what first brought Buk into my life, so this thinly veiled fictional account of its making was a joy to read. It's a bit goofy in spots (some of the names Buk came up with to represent the real stars he encountered are ridiculous), but classic Buk nonetheless. Why isn't Buk taught in college English classes yet"
books,4 of 6,4.0,"After All These Years, Still Applicable",This decades old book will probably go down as one of the most successful books ever. The ideas contained within are certainly valid for any age.
books,3 of 3,5.0,Constance is WHAT?!?!?!?,"After stumbling over a weak and silly plot in Brimstone, the authors recovered nicely in Dance of Death, and now has brought the trilogy home to an-almost flawless conclusion in Book of the Dead. From the moment Pendergast busted out of Herkmoor prison, this fantastic and horrifying tale held me enthralled. The book features wild action, the ""gotta-love-him"" journalist Smithback, interesting tidbits involving Egyptology, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and plenty of fun technical information (dynamite, anyone?). I could not put this book down and read it over two days (""sorry, honey, the dishes aren't done and nothing's cooking on the stove""). Note: this novel is not ""stand-alone""; start with Cabinet of Curiosities, Brimstone, and Dance of Death. Book of the Dead is definitely my favorite in the Pendergast series."
books,1 of 3,1.0,Run from the fork!  Run from the Fork!,"How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing"

I wish everyone in my family, especially my parents, had read it before my father died. Much of what was going on with him would have been more understandable."
books,6 of 8,5.0,THE BEST BOOK ON FORECLOSURES,"This book is great... I read the reviews and they were all true!!! The author's language is clear and simple.  The books gives you all the forms, checklist, pros and cons on the foreclosing homes, dos and dont's.  and for the price, you can't go wrong, even if you just get it for the forms and list of websites and reference he gives in the books, it is worth it"
books,,5.0,Collaborative Generalship,"What a joy it was to read this book, and another of Fischer's books; Paul Revere's Ride. Written in narrative storytelling fashion, the book moves briskly--but with urgency. I will save the long reviews for the top 500 writers here at Amazon, but I found this book to be extremely satisfying.  What's more, not only does Fischer illuminate Washington's determination to keep the idea of liberty alive, he also writes about the tremendous help given the Continental Army by locals who continued to harass the British throughout the winter as British foraging parties searched for food for themselves and their horses."
books,57 of 60,5.0,Seven Innovative Rules of Good Innovative Management,"""This book challenges the prevalent misconceptions about innovation, and lays out the tools and processes necessary for an organization to harness and execute innovation (from the Introduction)."""
books,3 of 3,5.0,Amazing for a debut book.,"I have been interested in reading something by Grisham for quite a while, but I was recently ""pushed"" to actually read one of his books when I saw the movie version of ""A Time to Kill"". The obvious book to start with was ""A Time to Kill"". I had heard that Grisham is good, and I really enjoyed the movie, so I was expecting a lot. I was not disappointed. This book brings out some very interesting ideas about murder and the justification for it. It also gave a very large amount of information about the legal system in general and trials in particular. This legal iformation was probably my favorite part."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Most readers will like this one best of all,"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life.  In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement.  The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House.  The action is more dramatic.  The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing.  The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control.  The humor still abounds.  The language is easier to read but no less descriptive.  No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement"
books,6 of 6,5.0,Large content for a small book...,"I think the marketing hype for Ajax has some people skeptical.  So let's get the record straight:  Ajax is here to help move web development ahead into the arenas that it needs to be in, while not needing to rely on Flash to implement a killer interface.  It utilizes standard technologies that have been around, and is functional on almost all web browsers, but with a new mentality and intention. It's also a load of fun to develop, and see the results..."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Break No Bones,"A great novel. However Ms. Reichs should get someone to check her botany. Being very familar with Francis Marion Natl. Forset and a biologist there is no way that one would find cool loving hemlock. Instaed ther are cypress, tupelo, pine, oaks, pines etc but no hemlocks in Francis Marion NF. It would be found in the mountains."

books,,5.0,Rich Pearls of Wisdom,I have read many inpiratational books.  This one is particularly unique in that it is both down to earth and offers the author's refreshing and uplifting perspective.  The author has many rich pearls of wisdom to share and the personal writing style makes you feel as if this soulful sage is sitting right there next to you.  I enjoy this book and keep it handy for those days when everything seems to be going the wrong way.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who could use some refreshing inspiration.
books,2 of 3,5.0,Outstanding,"This powerful book will help you focus on the importance of living in the present and prioritizing issues. It is a resource for all people, of all religions and spiritual beliefs. It will provide you support to help you through a crisis. It is a tool to be shared with family and friends."
books,6 of 10,2.0,a little caution needed,"One of the most confusing things about logic and reason is that it all necessarily depends on what you mean by the words you use, which is to say... it all depends.   I note for example, in the introductory chaper, page 1, ""Overgeneralization"", there are a couple major overgeneralizations.  That's why they needed to invent math and science, where nothing is real except precise definitions, and logic works wonderfully.  Using reason with actual real things takes more than logic"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Lud-in-the-Mist eugenic?,"This book was extremely well written. It's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all. What totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time, I have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20's. She most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end. For example, on page 233, ""And if all the gifts of Life are good, perhaps, too, are all the shapes she chooses to take, and which we cannot alter."" The book is filled with hints at the time period even though, after looking at countless reviews, the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that Lud-in-the-Mist did not and it was a ""fantastical"" piece of literature. In my opinion, this book was TOTALLY based on the time period. There's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he's not ""white"" anymore he has come down in the world. If you're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20's, this is an astounding piece"
books,7 of 7,5.0,An Intellectual Romp in the Hay,"Magically recovering his youth, Jurgen, a poet-cum-pawn broker of medaeval France, begins an erotic odyssey, in which he beds King Arthur's bride-to-be, a love goddess in her realm of pleasure, a tree nymph, the queen of Philistines, a vampire in Hell. He also gets to talk to God, Satan -- and the mysterious Katschei, creator of all things as they are. Full of puns, word play, references to obscure myths and legends of various cultures, and Americanizing the tradition of the picaresque epic, JURGEN is a delight for the Mensa set and ordinary readers alike. This edition reproduces the delightful illustrations cut for the first British publication of the work"

books,1 of 1,5.0,America's secret weapon - it rates 10 stars.,I accidentally bumped into this book when I was in my 20s.  Had no idea where it would lead me.  Read it practically in one sitting.  I was amazed that I understood what Cabell was driving at even tho I could not have explained it coherently to anyone.
books,9 of 10,4.0,Bringing the theory into practice,"Boyatzis and McKee have made it very easy for all of us who believe that leaders can create highly effective and productive organizations in a reflective, humane way.  They've put their vast research base to excellent use in creating this easy to follow guide that helps leaders, OD and HR personnel and coaches create workplaces with open communication, compassion for others, and a low-stress environment, resilient in the face of today's complex business environment.  This is a quick read, full of tools easily adaptible for practitioners and case examples.  At last! A business case for doing business in an enlightened way"

""The Fate of the Corps"" is one of those books. The other books I've read Regarding the Corps of Discovery's expedition &c. always left me Wondering what became of the less well-known members. This book tells their Story in a highly Readable and captivating way."

Then I got to the chapter on Dads and Daughters and thought &quot;At last!&quot;  This is the first concrete advice I've found on how to help my daughter.  It's great to recognize that fathers play an important role too.  One of my daughter's teachers read this, and is going to start a program at her school to stop relational aggression, so even more girls will benefit"
books,18 of 32,1.0,Diary of a madman.,"It's not too difficult to understand how ""Behold a Pale Horse"" has become ""the best selling underground book of all time""(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental ""Tragedy and Hope"".)"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Excellent Facsimile,"This is an excellent edition to have in one's library. It helps in dealing with some of the translation debates. When some KJOs tell you that the KJV is the only ""perfect"" translation of God's word you can ask them which edition of the KJV they are referring to. If I had a dime for every time I've heard a KJO pastor or lay person hold their bible up and say, ""I have the 1611, God's word, and only the 1611 is God's word..."" I would have a pretty bank account. So few know that the bible they hold aloft is actually a mild revision completed in 1769. Most of them have never laid eyes on an original 1611 and if they did I'm sure they would be shocked to their socks that they could barely read the somewhat challenging 17th century King's English. You can show them this facsimile bible so they can see a picture of the real thing."

books,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent Horror Fiction- Well Narrated,"I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel, and what can I say? I loved it. I've never read anything before by this author, but the narration, the spinechilling series of events and the loveable characters made me want to read more. I sincerely hope there is a sequel."
books,39 of 39,5.0,Finally Set Free From Dieting!,"I highly recommend this wonderful God-given book! I am a former Weigh Down Workshop coordinator, was searching for a less condemning approach, and God led me to this book! The &quot;Hunger Scale&quot; is easy to abide by and the spiritual approach is very inspiring, uplifting, and healing. I believe the answer most people struggling with weight control is looking for; it certainly was for me!  It is written in a format that can be used personally or in a small support-type group setting"

We get to choose the side we play on by being a positive person or a negitive person.  This book will lift your spirits and ""fill your bucket""!  If you want to get fired up today read this book, and if you want to get a friend fired up and ""fill their bucket"" suggest they buy it too, or better yet buy a copy and give it to them.  Thanks for an inspiring read. David Otis Author of ""Walk Fast, Talk Loud and Smile""."
books,13 of 13,5.0,Negotiation versus Regime Change,"Scott Ritter provides chapter and verse on how conflict with the Axis of Evil nations could have been avoided with direct negotiation.  The mullahs of Iran sought to negotiate with everything on the table, including nuclear weapons and a treaty with Israel. North Korea still wants direct negotiations.  So did Saddam. We don't negotiate with regimes we want to remove.  Bush prefers to ""take them out"" no matter how many Americans die"
books,1 of 1,2.0,A Bit Disappointed,"I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like ""The Notebook"" or ""The Wedding"" if you want a good romantic read."
books,7 of 8,5.0,Fantastic!!,"I loved this book.  I found this fun and entertaining while providing specific, salient, concise and actionable ideas on managing a business while being driven by creativity.  I'm a recovering business executive just starting my own entrepreneurial enterprise and I found this work enormously helpful in helping me define and launch my business.  I can't recommend this book enough.  GET THIS BOOK"
books,2 of 2,5.0,pseudo-conservatives,"In his 1950 study of the authoritarian personality, Theodor Adorno constructed a political-psychological profile of people he called ""pseudo-conservatives."" These were people who called themselves conservatives but in truth adhered to political agendas that betrayed the ideals of individual freedom and free markets. Pseudo-conservatives were motivated by hate, fear, and power, not the desire to conserve or guarantee liberty. A few years later, the eminent historian Richard Hofstadter appropriated Adorno's term in describing what he called ""the paranoid style in American politics.""  In Adorno and Hofstadter's day, this paranoid style of pseudo-conservativism was still in its embryonic state, personified by the rantings of Joseph McCarthy but still far from being the game plan for the Republican Party as a whole. David Brock's Blinded by the Right chronicles how this movement slithered its way into power long before anyone had heard of Karl Rove, whose name isn't even listed in the index."
books,1 of 2,5.0,This book scared me more than any other.,"I grew up in a big old Victorian house a lot like Hill House, and one day when I was about 12 years old,and my folks were gone, I started reading The Haunting of Hill House."
books,2 of 4,5.0,A GREAT IMPROVISATION is a Great Treat,"The brilliantly insightful Stacy Schiff proves yet again that she is, without a doubt, one of America's most gifted biographers. Benjamin Franklin springs to life here in all his complexity: Schiff's elegant prose renders his seven-year stay in France utterly fascinating. The nuanced portrait of Franklin that emerges in these pages will be of great interest to anyone at all intrigued by this endlessly complicated figure and his role in American history. I would venture to say that A GREAT IMPROVISATION is as compelling as the very best novels--the sort that once you've begun, you simply can't put down. And this, I believe, is in no small part due to Schiff's prose, which is as lucid as it is graceful--qualities much sought-after but not often found by discriminating readers. One would expect nothing less from this Pulitzer Prize-winning author"

books,10 of 10,5.0,"Man, is it me, or can Greg Iles REALLY write?","Ever since he hit the scene many years ago with Spandau Phoenix, I have followed Greg Iles' amazing career with a great deal of interest.  I don't know of any author currently working that can hold a candle to his sheer talent for writing in such a wide variety of genre's.  So far he has tackled historical thriller, legal thriller, supernatural, murder/mystery and straight-on action/adventure thriller.  What genuinely sets Mr. Iles apart is that not only has he written these many styles, but he quite literally COMMANDS each genre that he writes.  I know of NO living author who has made such a wide attempt at writing, and certainly nobody who has ever managed to do it so incredibly well."
books,2 of 10,1.0,Don't Even Waste your time with this book!,"Clear And Present Danger is OK at points, but the rest of the novel is boring with the CIA work, the action between the Commandos don't feel realistic, the story drags on on for hundreds of pages, the boring details of how big a ship is, that is boring! If you want to read a REAL and exciting novel, read Bob Mayer's Eyes Of The Hammer. Bib Mayer is a former Special Forces officer, the action is there, and is VERY EXCITING unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Escape to Paradise!,"This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure. You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars!"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Very Energetic,"I've read the reviews that some other people have written, and they say this book is very off topic and has a lot of selfishness in the characters, and that the events taking place in the tribulation don't happen the way they are supposed to.  HELLO PEOPLE, this is a FICTION book.  I'm not saying the events that the scriptures say will happen aren't going to happen, because the Rapture will occur some day.  I'm saying if Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins wrote a story ONLY on the scriptures and no characters or settings or anything in the story, the story would be way shorter and not as suspenseful.  Because when the Anti-Christ gets assassinated, there can be hundreds, maybe thousands of ways that could happen.  So when you people say everything in this book is a bunch of garbage, remember this is a STORY."
books,4 of 27,4.0,Good Read,I may be somewhat biased in my review because Sarah Vowell is my insperation. The short stories of her life are classis and fun. They are so easy to identify with and the cover real issues. Things that can be entertaing yet insightfull
books,6 of 28,2.0,Too Politically Correct,I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.
books,5 of 7,5.0,Novellas Make For A Great Read,"Novellas are an odd duck, significantly longer than short stories and much shorter than full length novels.  I suspect that it takes considerable self discipline to maintain one's focus for from between 10,000 and 40,000 words (which may explain why novellas are infrequent).  Whatever it takes, Ed McBain inveigled a terrific coterie of writers to create a series of wonderful stories which can keep you going from the beach to the mountains."

I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money."

I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it"
books,6 of 8,4.0,Insightful!,"According to the authors and contributors, the example of Jesus Christ contains indispensable lessons for leadership. However, in the Gospel, Jesus seems to have commanded disciples primarily to love God and one another. He never seems to have promised success in worldly business affairs or to have offered managerial precepts. On the other hand, in the parable of talents he taught his followers to be fiscally conservative and to invest wisely. To their credit, the authors and editors who compiled this book acknowledge that Christianity never set itself up specifically as a recipe for business success. Regardless, they conclude, that applying precepts they identify will lead to success. The leadership guidelines they quote make sense and do not exclude thoughtful businesspeople of any theological background. The authors illustrate their advice with amusing, instructive anecdotes. The counsel is accessible, ethically illuminating and personally inspiring, although if you usually skip the sermon, it may not be for you. We believe that its primary appeal will be to Christians who seek to serve as servant leaders in their communities and workplaces."

books,1 of 1,5.0,The Best of America,"I eyed Washington's Crossing for a long time before finally purchasing it. Meanwhile in the past couple of years I read Ellis' ""His Excellency, George Washington,"" and McCullough's ""John Adams"" and ""1776.""  Although I am by no means finished reading about the period and its individuals, I have gotten a wonderful education in the lives and times of this era.  All of these books complement each other and Washington's Crossing is the crowning piece that ties much of it together. Washington's Crossing is very pro-American and pays homage to Washington as a great man and leader. Revisionist and alternative views of the making of our nation do not have a place here. Instead, the author focuses on the best ideals that made the United States great such as respect for individuals of all stations, a willingness to listen to the views of others, flexibility and perseverance in adversity and changing situations, the placing of the good of the nation ahead of one's advancement and glory, and decency on the field of war. As a historical record the book is outstanding and tells the story from both sides. The British are not a faceless and evil enemy, but a group of largely decent and capable people trying to do the right thing from their perspective. We Americans should regard ourselves as fortunate in having them as our ""mother country"" and the basis for our own institutions. The various battles and maneuvers of the New York and New Jersey campaigns are described in detail, but not in a minute, mind-numbing matter, and the result is fascinating history. Many maps are included that will aid the reader in understanding the action. The book contains many appendices that provide much added and incidental detail that the reader eager for more knowledge will enjoy. ""Washington's Crossing"" is a keeper for a lifetime and now sits on a bookshelf awaiting my return"

books,,5.0,Lives up to the hype!,"There was a lot of hype surrounding this book, with the movie and all, and after reading, I have to say, I fell in love with it! Ms. Jones is the perfect chick lit heroine and she made me laugh so many times! A book that is this good is a rare treat, so don't pass it up if you haven't read it yet! Along with it, I also recommend ""Heartbreaker"" by Kim Corum, another good chick lit book"

With her great detailed narrative she makes you fell inside the history of the modern microbe hunters, I've read several other book in this subject and none of them treats the subject in the professional and ""journalistic"" way Garrett does. You can easily detect she knows her business, the concepts and the way she makes them all make sense is laudable."

books,5 of 5,5.0,From pizza to pasta and everything in between,"The Teens Vegetarian Cookbook,arranged by Judy Krizmanic, includes commentaries from dozens of vegetarian and vegan teens on how they like to prepare their food and little tips like that applesauce tastes good with french toast, or what kinds of toppings taste good on a cheese-less pizza. There are even detailed instructions on how to cook spaghetti... for neophytes of the kitchen! I particularly like the section in the back on vegetarian survival in college as I will be heading off there myself in a couple years. There are handy lists and charts too, like how to mix and match to make a variety of pasta salads... or a sort of shopping list on the kinds of foods a vegetarian might want to stock their pantry with."

books,3 of 4,5.0,The West vs. the rest,"What a surprise.  From the title and cover art I was expecting a 4th of July - My country `tis of thee - stand at attention and salute book full of patriotic drivel. But this is a very substantial and thoughtful study of America's institutions and its critics. And the author has a gift for straightforward, easy to understand exposition."
books,6 of 7,4.0,Such a Simple beginning for a giant called SONY,"&quot;Made in Japan&quot; gives us insight in to Japanese working ethos, their dedication and vision. It is a story of SONY, a company that is world leader in many electronic and IT products, told in simple manner by creator of SONY Mr Akio Morita. Coming from him, one has to believe every word of it. It is fascinating to read and travel along, as the story progress, with a small seedling's growth in to a big corporate giant that SONY today is. No brashness, no adoption of unfair means, no showing off its economic strength. It is a plain simple story of a dreamer who dared to dream and succeeded. An interesting reading"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Daily structure resource for multi-dimensional worship,"I've used this book for about two years as a simple, predictable structure for prayer and bible reading.  Each week, new area or faith is explored, following the lectionary used in most churches today. A simple invocation (or opening) prayer is presented, followed by a Psalm reading. Next is a reading on the subject, which is borrowed from other resources (these readings cross all boundaries in terms of geography and date written), followed by a Scripture reading.  Next is a time of reflection, where one is encouraged to journal and reflect upon the topic in light of the information presented from man and the Word.  Next is prayer time, a hymn, and a closing prayer.  A weekly &quot;recipe&quot; with some ingredients provided, the book has a life span of 4 years, with the current edition 2001-2004"
books,6 of 7,4.0,Classic Liberalism at its best,"An all-time favorite of mine, Capitalism & Freedom creates a framework of classic liberalism and argues forcefully in favor of free-markets and decentralization over the expansion of government involvement in economic and social affairs.  Friedman builds his argument from the ground up by identifying coercion as the State's distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations.  From the (classic) liberal's perspective, this aspect shapes the relationship between citizen and government, and strictly limits the appropriateness of State involvement in society, particularly with regard to well-intentioned programs and policy."

books,,4.0,"It's the Far Side, but...","Okay, it's a collection of Far Side comics, which is what I want, so it's awesome for that reason.  BUT, the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing.  First, all the comics are black and white.  Yeah, it's not about the art and you don't miss much without color, but come on, would a little color kill anyone (especially ones that were originally color)?  Second, it's pretty thin on strips, with 4 to a page most of the time (a good amount) sometimes 2 on a page, and even occassionally one comic on a single page!  It looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page."

books,2 of 4,5.0,If I Had One Book on a Deserted Island...,"This is one of the best, most enjoyable books ever written, in my opinion.  It is a combination history (of a now by-gone America), essay (on what it means to be American, on the coming modern world, on racism, on travel, even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking), memoir, history, travelogue and poem.  Steinbeck sets off with his dog Charley in a glorified pickup truck to see America in 1960.  He explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states.  He meets people, he offers opinions, he converses with his pal Charley, and he offers a comment on America - past, present, and future.  I find this a fascinating, thoroughly enjoyable (and I'd even say ""classic"") read.  And I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on America and travel with Charley and the great author who drove him around.  For those familiar with John Steinbeck only as a writer of fiction, this book reveals a new side, and one I think you will enjoy"

books,11 of 11,5.0,A &quot;must&quot; for students of Chicago history &amp; architecture,"In Lost Chicago, historian David Lowe explores the architectural and cultural history of America's great &quot;heartland&quot; city. This is a community who architectural heritage was all to often squandered during the last five decades of its growth and evolution. Lowe's elegant, and informative text is wonderfully enhanced with more than 270 rare, period photos and prints (many of them published here for the first time). Lost Chicago is a celebration of the age of Gustavus Swift and Philip D. Armour and the greatest stockyards in the world; when Cyrus McCormick, Potter Palmer, George Pullman, and Marshall Field were the national barons of business and industry; when Prairie Avenue and State streets rivaled New York's Fifth Avenue; when architectural giants ranging from Louis Sullivan to Frank Lloyd Wright were designing buildings of incomparable excellence and innovation. Lost Chicago is a &quot;must&quot; for students of Chicago history, architecture, and personalities"

Guitar chords above measures in the music make easy for a non-piano expert such as myself to play the songs and sing along. Now this is not an original broadway score, and some songs sound awkward on the piano, but once a person is set with just sitting down at the piano to have fun playing their favorite Rent songs, this book is perfect"

I was an English major in college and find myself incredibly bored by most contemporary writers.  Ms. Boylan does an excellent job of writing in Bronte's style.  While it is obvious that the work is not entirely Bronte's, as one of the other review mentioned, that is besides the point.  The book is thoroughly enjoyable and a great read!"

books,0 of 11,1.0,"West Africa gets the short end, yet again...","Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been ""founded by whites from the North"". Fact is, there were no ""whites"" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race ""browns""."

books,1 of 2,2.0,UNINSPIRED TALE OF  A BOY WONDER GONE ASTRAY,"Reading the other reviews, I see some people are so admiring of M. Night Shyamalan that anything he writes or directs is a work of creative genius. No doubt Shyamalan is talented but maybe his fame and fortune came too soon to keep his ego in check. I know some of the people mentioned in the book and was curious how their interactions with Shyamalan would be portrayed. Shyamalan is his own number one fan and he has no patience for anyone who disagrees with him or critizes his work. He has had a few successful movies and believes all studio executives should trust in him completely. I was amazed that Shyamalan approved of the book since it shows so much of his darker side. Shyamalan sets his own rules. He can feels he has the right to demand a certain salary but then feels  betrayed by an actress who asks for more than the SAG minimum he has offered her. He loves his family yet doesn't seem to accept that a film executive can break his rules by placing her family above work. The book is worth a read if you are a Shyaman fan or wonder what led up to the disaster that became LADY IN THE WATER. There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a rare talent with new ideas. It is only his ego that stands in his way of even great succes"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Almost Succeeds,"This book provides great insight into Marlon Brando, the man, and his view of the world and himself in it.  Marked by poignant, eloquent, intelligent, and fascinating interludes on philosophy, history, and--perhaps most surprisingly--the craft of acting itself, readers will enjoy getting to know the Brando behind the tabloid images and salacious gossip mongers.  Brando also almost succeeds in his thinly-veiled project of deconstructing his own myth.  Perhaps betraying just how deeply his father's early and constant beratements of his abilities and potential affected him (""You'll never amount to anything""), Brando cannot seem to believe that he did anything out of the ordinary.  He is beyond disparaging about his own acting and dismissive of his titanic achievements in cinema, art, and cultural redefinition.  Generally considered the finest actor of all time, Brando--in two separate decades--twice revolutionized acting and redefined the medium.  He was a liberal and a humanitarian eminently more interested in making a contribution to humankind in some other (in his words, ""more important"") endeavor than acting.  He several times states that not all is black and white, it is a ""polka dot"" world, and he is understanding of the shortcomings of others.  Yet he is a harsh judge of himself and seems to view his own life in either/or terms.  He succeeded in important ways in helping mankind or he frittered away his talents on the meaningless if lucrative game of acting.  Still, his achievement as well as the pervasiveness of his cultural influence (think blue jeans and t-shirts), despite his own discounting of it here, was remarkable.  Sensitive, thoroughly enjoyable, very funny, and exceedingly humble, this memoir is not complete, but it gives us a window into the mind of one of the most remarkable and influential personalities of the last century."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Perhaps the most important book of the 90s,"Why are the three most powerful forces in our world--evolution, democracy and capitalism--so controversial? Hundreds (in the case of democracy, thousands) of years after they were first understood, we still can't quite believe these three phenomena work. Socialist Europe resists capitalism, the religious right in America questions evolution and the Middle East makes a mockery of democracy. When you think about it, it's easy to understand why: all three are radically counterintuitive. ""One person, one vote?"" What if they vote wrong?"
books,7 of 8,5.0,simple eloquence,"Man could Buk write. But could he write. I suppose we are all just posers and pretenders and wanna-bes in his shadow, but Buk is essential reading for anyone interested in studying the craft and art and technique of writing, of, as Buk would say 'laying down the word,' and when it came to it, Buk could do it better than anyone. I've tried to write a passage with as much simplicity and elegance and attitude as he had and failed completely. His sparse prose and mastery of the obvious and attitude all contribute to a unique style in American letters that exemplify the beauty of our language when wielded by a master. Post Office, Hollywood, Factotum and Ham On Rye are MUST reads for any serious student of modern writing. And damned entertaining stories to boot"

""Balanced (whatever that means!)"" is good. Loren Cordain also has a theory. His theory makes as good or better sense than most of the others: Our body and mind are probably better off if we eat the foods we evolved with over a couple of million years of evolution.  What makes Cordain's approach different is that he backs it up with real science, that is, testing his theory with real research and real tests on real subjects using the scientific method.  If the tests don't show that the one or another part of the theory is working it gets cut out and the theory modified.  I'm tired of trying out untested theories which are politically correct or sound good.  I want science.  Cordain delivers."

Although perhaps superceded by the cognitive and neurobiological approaches that have developed in the last few decades, Freud was still a brilliant thinker who changed our undestanding of the mind for the better."

It is simply amazing to me that anyone can write so beautifully in a second language; Thwe is very talented.  I hope that he keeps writing.

Most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks, but little knowledge is given to the reader. Beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper. I wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days, then show you how they break down the races to make their selections, not with programs they want to sell. It would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track, if they would bet it or pass it"

I found myself crying from time to time while reading this book because it touched so many chords in my own broken heart. The fact that God used a patrolman to save her life is just one part of this incredibly moving and unforgettable story. I had never heard of Tina Zahn until I read this book, and now I can't stop telling people, especially those who are struggling with depression and trauma issues to read this book! You won't regret reading it either, I assure you it will speak to your heart in a graphic but tender way"
books,4 of 5,5.0,Yum Yum,"I love this cookbook.  I try a new recipe just about every other night, and so far I have found only one dud.  It is fresh,has lots of taste, and delicious. I also love that the book is set up as meals, so she provides the main course recipe and also recipes for sides and dessert to go with the main course. There is a ""make your own takeout"" section, a ""healthy eating"" section, a ""fancy meals"" section, and a section of foods that kids will eat. There may be other sections too that I dont remember. The food is generally OK for you, but I modify a bit by using low sodium broth and skimp on some items she suggests to add to the dish. Also, I am on a budget, and ingredients required are very simple... nothing too fancy or exotic/expensive! The best cookbook I ever bought! ...but beware, it takes more than 30 minutes."

If you have ever wondered why senior management would not fund a project when the company is having a record profit month, Berman will explain why this maybe the best choice.  Throughout the very palatable training there are fascinating examples from the newspaper headlines (Enron/Worldcom/...) of what these headliners did with their finances that was wrong but was overlooked for some time.  This is not just what the definitions are but that they mean."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Makes you aware,Makes you aware of some of the medical miracles happening in this country.
books,1 of 1,5.0,a sober biography without glorification or vilification,"David Herbert Donald truly does the work of the historian and allows the reader to come face to face with the real Lincoln.  The importance of the subject demands as much: the upbringing, temperament, private life, politics, pressures, shortcomings, and ideals of the man who headed the United States during the civil war and ended the institution of slavery.  Donald's biography captures all of this, but what I appreciated most was getting to see how Lincoln lived the conflict between some of America's greatest ideals and grimist realities in both what he was faced with and how he conducted himself as president"
books,6 of 9,5.0,It gets to the point,I have looked around for a book with simple and candid explanations on how to use credit cards.  Bilker's format is great.  The examples can easily be applied to your next credit purchase so you can save money.  I am going to  buy a few copies for some of my relatives and friends
books,1 of 1,2.0,Uncomfortable,"That's how I felt the whole time I was reading this book. I loved The Sixth Sense, really liked Unbreakable, sorta liked Signs, and hated The Village. When Lady in the Water came out, I really didn't have any desire to see it. However, when I saw this book in the library, I have to admit that I was intrigued. As a writer, I'm always curious as to how others go through the writing process. What drives them? A peek into a creative mind like Shyamalan's was too much too resist."
books,4 of 10,5.0,potent romantic suspense tale,"In Avon County, Pennsylvania, Homicide Detective Evan Crosby is sick when he sees the fourth victim in under a month.  Each casualty was pretty young female, ages 12 - 14, attending a private school, and left without shoes.  His lover, FBI profiler Annie Marie McCall tries to give him solace, but knows how difficult coping with this case is."
books,12 of 12,4.0,Highly Recommended,"Culture and tradition, funny or deadly serious anecdote followed by a harrowing confrontation with Burma's brutal military regime characterize ""From the Land of the Green Ghosts."" Yet the story is told so gracefully that one feels eased into a life and death struggle rather than abruptly confronted by it (as one might find with a Western writer.) The advantage is that the author, the gifted Pascal Khoo Thwe, can punctuate his narrative with a precise, violent detail. Heart-stopping scenes appear neither moral nor immoral, only horrifying, a postcard from one of the most repressed countries in the world."
books,,5.0,Ths book is a life-changer,The dramatic story Frankl relates is hard to believe but is true. How he managed to learn something so positive from his horrible experience is truly inspirational. I give this book to anyone who is suffering in life because it so clearly teaches how to overcome ANY obstacle
books,5 of 10,5.0,the meaning of my life,"To paraphrase from preface's the famous Dr. Noam Chomsky's (a personal hero) suggestion regarding our ignorance, we do not have any idea  how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved.  I have read this book the year it first came out (1997) and many times over since; should one still belive that thoughts, feelings, beliefs, meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood?  Dr. Pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we ,I mean any non-psychologist, take for granted every day.  I use my mind every day.  (My wife and co-workers might want to argue otherwise, but they are wrong!  I do think on a daily basis.).  Yet I don't have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain.  Is the 17 th century French philiospher Rene Descart right when he proclaimed ""I think therefore I am?""  What insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since Descart's time?  Another words, do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind?  Dr. Pinker, now at Harvard and a gaint in this field, do not have the answers.  As a matter of fact, he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true.  However, he has painted an overall picture on the state-of-art research on cognition.  Oh, the book.  It has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried (I think and hope) to tickle readers' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs.  For example, under the standard equipment chapter, rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind.  He used the working definition of intlliegence (ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one's action to reach that point) to illustrate that we use our desires (ie the latest big screen Sony TV) and use our beliefs (ie if I work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income) to increase the chance of achieving that result (i.e. watching the Final Four basketball games on SONY big screen TV).   Yet is this stimluli (vivid and beautiful live college hoops on TV) and response (working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income) due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input?  Do we endlessly shop for junks we cannot possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all?  Perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere knee-jerk response to stimuli.  What about the molecular/celluar level of the brain?  Can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work?  From page 99, Dr. Pinker stated from the mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts that neurons have one purpose in life: ""add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded.""  Are you joking me?  With a description like this, it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron.  Suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level, as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness (my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks) that might be more important than any single cell.  Another words, perhaps thoghts, ideas, imagination, emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these ""supercomputer"" networking.  This conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless.  What about complexity itself?  Can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival?  It is beyond imagination of my limited mind (no pun intended) that perhaps I don't have adequate brain power to understand my mind?  So why should I or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way?  A mental life is the result of my mind, and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases.  Why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space?  Is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings?  Why can I be peaceful and happy like I want to be every time I am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in Los Angeles?  Dr. Pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish.  He only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas.  I keep this book close to me at an arm's reach every time my mind fails me (more frequent than I like now days and I am only 36 years old) and I re-read it over and over for its shear beauty, audacity, and clarity.  Unquestion the authorative guide to my or any one's mind"
books,,4.0,I have to be fair to Ms. Gerritsen,"I blasted her when she wrote The Apprentice and hated the Jane Rizzoli character. In Body Double however, I found the twosome of Maura and Jane a good match. This was a quick read, lots of twists and turns and a surprise ending that I thought was rather quirky and fun."
books,4 of 4,5.0,an understanding of innovation,"This book is written in a concise manner that is straightforward and easy to understand. Utterback explains how innovation has evolved over the years, using great examples from a variety of assembled and non-assembled industries. One side note, I found that this book was worth the cover price for the history of industries he mentions alone. Some of the products and industries mentioned in this book include: Incandescent light bulbs, Typewriters, Glass, photography, and Ice. This book is loaded with invaluable nuggets of insight, it is impossible to due it justice in a book review. I highly recommend reading it"

books,8 of 8,5.0,Awe inspiring-can't-put-it-down-book,"This is not the type of book I usually read.However,I am so glad I dispensed with my usual fare to read this book. John  McCain's account of his family,his years at the Naval Academy and how those years molded him,his funny,entertaining and low key style are wonderful. His matter of fact recounting of his appalling six year captivity as a POW of the North Vietnamese is sickening and shocking. He writes about his captors,whose beatings,starvation and abuse were a way of life for him and other American prisoners,with amused comtempt,not bitterness or rancor. Since I hated them about three pages into his story of his years in prison,I find that remarkable. Probably helped him keep his sanity."

books,3 of 3,5.0,I couldn't put this book down!,"This is an excellent and insightful book that should be required reading in high schools.  I have never been to Europe and must say that after reading While Europe Slept I have zero desire to go.  For years I have ranted about the scourge of ""political correctness"" to my friends and family and refuse to partake in it.  This book is a great illustration of how destruction PC is.  I wonder if Europe will wake up before it's too late?"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Must read if you are a teacher,"This is the best book on teaching out there. Every teacher must read this book, and not just once, but every year. It is very practical and easy to read. Dr. Hendricks defines teaching as ""causing people to learn"" (87). The teacher is not somebody who covers material but enables students to change. Thus, the definition of learning is ""change."" This book is highly recomended"

Guess he thought it's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice. For all his ramblings in this book, he might as well blabber on the Emmy Awards and get lost ! Let's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds"

books,2 of 3,5.0,Innocence Triumphant,If blood and gore is your preference do NOT read this book.  It is a simple story with a touch of magic.  I first read it when I was about 12 and have been looking for it ever since.  It has joined my home library for neighborhood children and my grandchildren.
books,17 of 17,5.0,Taking One-to-One marketing to the CEO's agenda,"Having just finalised an e-business thesis on Online Personalization, I must say that this book is an impressive source on the strategic level for what is synonymously called CRM, One-to-One marketing, relationship marketing, etc."

books,2 of 2,4.0,Not just about money!!,"I found Built to Last to be an analytical look at the intangibles of success.  Core development and maintenance, personal growth, employee development and more, highlight the ""outside the bottom line"" look into an organization lasting longer than any one leader's tenure of influence.  Although I don't agree with every aspect of the book I still rate this high due to its ability to stimulate positive thinking"
books,,4.0,Wal-Mart Exposed,"I will admit right up front that John Dicker has written a clearly biased book against Wal-Mart. He is out to expose all that is bad about Wal-Mart and is reluctant to point out any good things about Wal-Mart (if there even are any). That being said, there are plenty of bad things to write about, and Dicker covers them all. The poor wages, forcing stores on communities that don't want one, foreign sweat shops, putting local small businesses out of business, and practicing censorship by not selling CDs and other items that don't mesh with the ""family-friendly"" image of Wal-Mart. The quintessential problem with Wal-Mart is that with every charge that is thrown at it, it views the each problem as a public relations matter and think that they need to work on adjusting their image, not their behavior."

books,1 of 1,4.0,Bizarre. Weird.  Triumphant.,How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.

books,12 of 22,5.0,Got to read it,"All I can say is that after reading this book, I had to read all of Daniel's other books. Very well written book and it makes you realize that no matter how well you know evolution, there are some clever implications of evolutionary algorithm that you may not have considered in the past."
books,29 of 61,2.0,What Liberal Media? What Round Earth?,"Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Elevates the level of Comic Books to all new High!,"Whether you're new to the DC Universe or a diehard fan from yesteryear, there is something in this amazing collection sure to delight you.  Intelligent stories with well written dialogue...reverence to the history of the iconic characters and breathtaking art.  What a superb collectible and a bonus that proceeds go to the very charitable organizations the Justice League members themselves would endorse!"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Fantastic for parents-to-be!,"We have this and the ""bible"" of maternity books, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting.""  But we may have well just thrown the other one away.  This book is great.  Each weeks there is information on how your baby is developing.  Many weeks have illustrations depicting what the baby might look like.  Info on the size and development of the baby and what changes are happening to the mother's body.  There are plenty of facts on things like nutrition and warning signs and symptions of disease.  And my wife's personal favorite was the ""Dad Tip"" each week.  It really is a well written book.  It doesn't overload you on information but keeps you aware of the mother's changing body and the development of the baby. A must have for any mother or father out there"

books,7 of 7,5.0,One of the best!!!,"There are at least 10,000 trading books out there.  I know because I have probably read half of them.  I also believe I have learned something from every one of them.  Most of the books are like Doctors, they specialize in one area or another.  This book, ""Mastering The Trade"" is different.  Its the ""General Practioner"" that really knows what he is doing."
books,1 of 2,4.0,"Good, in a classic sort of way","This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away."
books,8 of 14,2.0,Sexy Years for Who?,"Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like "" no wonder men leave us for younger woman"". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud"
books,,1.0,does this come with a money back guarantee?,"Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person."
books,1 of 2,1.0,Waste of time,"I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you"

books,,5.0,The Looming Tower,Well-researched book and well-written. It's amazing to trace the formation and progress of Al Qaed
books,2 of 4,2.0,Missing so much...,"I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like ""what just happened!"". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense."
books,4 of 8,5.0,Web 2.0 rationale,I have worked with some of the new web 2.0 products and felt unease at explaining how they fiteed into the 'selfish' model that we associate with economics. Benkler explains this without sounding hippyish or Marxist. A good read.
books,29 of 29,5.0,Great Book..FIVE stars,"Yet another impeccably researched and insightful exploration of the world of chefs from Ruhlman, one of the very very few non-chef writers who ""get it"". His look at previously written about subjects--and what's happened to them in the strange new world of ""chef branding"" and multi-unit expansion--and the terrible lure of Vegas is thoughtful and on target. Chefs who famously never open up to ordinary journalists are remarkably candid with Ruhlman."

books,,5.0,Excellent Book,"I was recommeded this book by a fitness coach.  I was about 50 lbs overweight and suffering health problems.  Anyhow, I been following the program for about 2 months now and occasionally work out and have lost 25 lbs.  I tried Atkins before and did lose about 40 lbs, but as soon as I went off and added carbs back I gained weight like no tomorow.  I wore everything I ate.  With this program I eat a lot of fruit and vegtables and the part that is great is it seems to kill your hunger after awhile.  I used to think about food most of the time and with this program, I actually sometimes have to remind myself to eat.  That is completely un-heard of for me prior.  Additionally, I feel much better, my compexion, and skin is much healthier looking.  I ve lost about 25 lbs already and I have  energy to want to work out.  With Atkins I had no energy and no endurance.  Occasionaly when I cheat, and eat bread, it actually upsets my stomach now.   I used to have indigestion frequently, now that is also gone.  I highly recommend this program"

When I feel disoriented or in need of solace, Alice Walker's writing sings to me as a mother to child. I feel blessed to have discovered her writing, as it has been a gift beyond all others. Her poems rise up as prayers to the Divine &amp; I am thankful to experience this connection. So thank you, Alice, for sharing your profound gift with us all"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Recommended daytrading book.,"This is an easy to read book with very specific trade setups and easy to follow instructions. So far after 2 weeks using the morning gap play it is consistently profitable. If you've traded you know two weeks doesn't prove anything, but it's nice to see something work right off the bat. A couple of his plays in the book I'm not comfortable with but I haven't tried them, and a couple of them require buying his tradestation codes, to be fair he does tell you how they work so if you want to code them yourself you could. No wishy washy theory here, just simple to follow set ups with profit targets with stop loss and real good advice on risk and amount of account needed per contract and how to wright a trading business plan and some info on computers. Overall a good book"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Atlas Shrugged,"I enjoyed this book.  It is well-written, literate in its allusions, sometimes amusing and always modest.  Yet it disappoints because ultimately it is no more nourishing or exciting than ""comfort food"" for those of us who are mired in middle age and welcome any reassurance that on issues of money, sex, health, and personal loss we are little different from others in our feelings of insecurity and diminished expectations.  There is little drama or development in this book.  It also would have been improved had the author been willing to delve deeper, to be less coy and a little more concrete.  Thus, by way of small example, Atlas might have informed the reader that he went to college at Harvard and not forced the reader to deduce it from his many references to Cambridge and the 25th Reunion Report.  This might have begun to explain some of his initial delusions of grandeur and his subsequent disappointments"
books,8 of 8,5.0,a life saver,"The best book out there on the subject.   So many women go through life just doing what the ""doctor"" says.   This book takes you to the next level and really helps you understand your body and what is out there that can help.    This may not be for everyone, but it has worked wonders for me and the people I know."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Phenomenal read,"This book blew my mind..the writing is clear and the ideas are exciting.  I thought it would be my summer read - but I was done in a few weeks -- I couldn't put it down. The book gives weight to the psychological, historical, philisophical and sociological aspects of the subject in a balanced and well presented format.  It is a delightful read..complex without being dry for a minute.  I highly recommend this book"

books,4 of 4,4.0,"If you love comics, don't miss this...","This fantastic volume comprises all the seperate ""treasury size"" comics produced by Ross and Dini. These wonderful tales feature the breathtaking art of Alex Ross, and the stories themselves focus essentially on the iconaclastic elements of the individual characters.  The motivations of Batman, Superman, Wonde Woman, etc, are revealved to the reader without the mess of having to adhere to the rigid soap opera continuity that is the focus of modern-era comics. These are simply great stories accompanied by great art; in a sense, what comics should be."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Thought provoking,"I thought the book was good when I read it first. It took me a second read to realize how exceptional it is. The book's reviews on Amazon site range from 5 star to 1 star, from people who were amazed by its brilliance to those who could not despise it enough. I think this is the best accolade that a leadership book can ever get - it takes a stance, it provides direction, and it chooses to be for a great cause irrespective of whether it is loved or hated. This book cannot and must not be ignored."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great Book,I love this book.  Everytime I read it I get something else from it.  My kids like it to because of the great animal pictures.  I have let co-workers borrow it and they had to buy their own.  Wonderful for all ages

There's a little ""Poisonwood Bible"" thrown in as the same character, in one his guises, ends up with a demented missionary in ""darkest Africa.""  The writing shifts from the ridiculous to the sublime--overall an entertaining read bringing promise of more to come from a talented young (30-year old) author"
books,6 of 6,5.0,Stroke Yoga And Beyond  ~  Lessons In Living In The Present,"Could anyone other than Ram Dass bring such a light-hearted, unattached, almost whimsical approach to the subject of aging and the accompanying physical problems that go with it as we journey towards death. Ram Dass shares his personal journey of aging with us just as he has everything else in his life for almost half a century now. Though his body has changed with time he still maintains that infectious smile, those bright, mischevious eyes and a beguiling wit and wisdom that has so endeared him to a generation of seekers who still look to him not so much for answers, but to posit the questions we cannot quite grasp ourselves."
books,14 of 14,5.0,Superb drug guide for nurses,"You can't go wrong with this fantastic drug guide! It is listed under generic names but if you don't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name.  I had a nurse/lawyer professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all.  This book delivered it ALL: classification, pregnancy catagory, indications, mechanism of action, contraindications and precautions, adverse reactions and side effects, interactions, route and dosage, availability, nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses! Also implementation, patient/family teaching and evaluation.  Wow! I've been very impressed.  It came through for me so I didn't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something! Davis's Drug Guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including: recent drug approvals, additional drugs, combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that  include class, indications, adverse reactions and side effects, route and dosage and contraindications and warnings.  Appendix E  is about natural/herbal products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book.  There are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites, formulas helpful for calculating doses, routine pediatric and adult immunizations,  recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs, schedules of controlled substances, food sources for specific nutrients (ie foods rich in K, Na, Ca, Fe, vit K, vit D, low Na, foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine), and insulin and insulin therapy.  Also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past.  The organized, easily found references in this guide could save your client's lives.  Just because a doctor orders it doesn't mean it is ok to give, as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all! Highly recommended! Good luck all future nurses!"
books,2 of 4,5.0,Understanding Iraq,"Finally, after reading this book, I feel informed. I've been reading lots of bits and pieces (articles) about the history of the Middle East and the Iraq war and often found it to be somewhat overwhelming. Understanding Iraq really did bring it all together for me. I especially appreciated that it was contained in a readable 213 pages. Now when I see or hear a name associated with the region, I can readily identify that place or person's role. I recognize that a region's history and politics can't be fully described in such a short book. But Understanding Iraq inspires one to explore further and the subject doesn't seem so overwhelming anymore. It's an excellent place to start. I highly recommend it to average Americans who want to be informed"
books,8 of 8,5.0,Warped! Warped! Warped!,"Yes, it's warped! I feel like such an utter sociopathic evil human being for thinking this sick creation is completely hysterical. Oh, gosh, I mean, what's wrong with me that I break out laughing over what sounds in description the most demented thing ever drawn?"
books,4 of 4,5.0,A Landmark Amongst Sales Literature,This is on of the first books I ever read on Selling and I have never forgotten it.  What still stands out after all of these years is Zig's placing a huge importance on questions.  In fact the book contains thousands of questions in its narration and you sort of pick up the habit naturally by example by just reading it.  Zig is also a friend to the customer by disseminating these effective but ethical selling techniques.  Do you want a rewarding career in sales?  Highly Recommended.
books,2 of 4,4.0,Early Heinlein Short Stories,"As with any collection of short stories, there's some variance in quality here.  Several are three-star, a few are four-star, and two are five-star.  ""The Long Watch"" is a great character study, with emphasis on loyalty, duty, conscience, and ethics.  The title story, ""The Green Hills of Earth"" is a wonderful but tragic tale of heroism and bravery, reminiscent of what we saw in the NYFD on 9/11/01. These last two make the whole collection worth buying"
books,0 of 4,5.0,"Eponymous, stygian, Parallax in intent, Neo-phreudiacism","I don't know where to start! This novel is a pager turner of an incredible story with an abyss of emotional depth that will leave the reader spent, shaken out of his or her wooden workaday existence. The descriptions of the dust-bowl and the Depression (the period following the stock market crash of 1929) made me weep more than once. The cast of characters calls to mind Dickens, and the presence of artificial limbs is outright Melvillian. Features also the excellent use of a fey man as the embodiment of a wooden, post-columbian textual figure. A must for teachers, students and parents who care about the rainforest."
books,5 of 5,5.0,My favorite interview book,"I use this book both for interviewing techniques and for preparing to be interviewed.  Its a great book for interviewing because he presents the pros and cons of different techniques and gives what I consider to be a good framework for identifying quality candidates.  Its a great book for preparing to be interviewed because it helps you identify the objectives of interviewers and make a better case.  As a hiring manager, you should be able to pass an interview with flying colors, shouldn't you?"
books,,5.0,Days of Future Past,This volume contains 10 of Heinlein's Future History stories written during the 1940's.
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Personal, Honest, & Inspirational",I can't believe the negative reviews I've just found regarding this title... and some of them written by so-called feminists themselves.  How can someone be offended by a book or the stories of others' lives?  Only if they choose to fear words or the expression of others' thoughts and ways of life.
books,6 of 6,5.0,Barbarian wife in China,"Using stories told by her Grandfather, Aimee Liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in China.  The story starts in San Francisco at the time of the big quake.  It is a love story of an American girl and a very educated Chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a Chinese person, much less married one.  Her husband is a part of Sun Yet-sen's battle to topple the Manchu Dynasty.  Within the novel is the history of China from the Opium War in 1840 to the Communist's  War of Liberation in 1949.  Good insight into the people of China and their relationship with the Western Powers"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Introduction to Lincoln!,If you don't know anything about Lincoln this book is for you!
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Tedious, Voluminous, Intense","Having chewed and digested ""Around the World in Eighty Days"", ""Five Weeks in a Balloon"" and ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked ""true"" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, ""20,000 Leagues"" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right."
books,11 of 12,1.0,I bought every edition of this book for 5 years,"and when didn't buy a new edition and I got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls, I got published. I know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition. All I can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily, thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has (LOL), but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track. This book won't help you do it"
books,,4.0,Enjoyed the book - a definite page turner.,I greatly enjoyed this book -- it is not the best one written by James Patterson but it was very good.  I would recommend it
books,0 of 1,5.0,You want the necrophiliac to escape?,"McCarthy's writing and portrayal of Lester Ballard, a necrophiliac, is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape. And then you have to wonder...why am I siding with a necrophiliac of all people? The writing is up to the high standards expected of McCarthy, and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche. The book has an interesting twist to the plot - Ballard is falsely accused of rape, his house is auctioned off and he's left as a social outcast, an animal. He is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal. If you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read"
books,,5.0,Vonnegut's best,I've read many of Vonnegut's books over the past few years and I have to say that this is easily his greatest work.  It contains a gripping tale about a protagonist that is stuck in a world that is almost certainly doomed to fail.  Along the way there are many interesting thoughts expressed and funny moments
books,1 of 3,4.0,Plot-driven and diverting,"No one would argue that this thriller is great literature.  But if you are looking for something good to read on the beach or a long airplane flight, this is just the ticket (so to speak)."
books,7 of 16,1.0,"Stoner Does Not Seem to Understand Dating Methods, Etc.","Stoner begins by warning that unscientific books written by Christians bring discredit upon Christianity and drive non-Christians away from the Gospel. Unfortunately, following this thinking, Stoner may be a major culprit. He simply accepts standard uniformitarian thinking as fact. His treatment of dating methods appears to show a complete misunderstanding of them. He says, for instance, that the circular reasoning of using fossils is obviated by the fact that fossils are used for dating only when they first have been shown to agree with isotopic dates. First of all, index fossils, and the concepts behind using them, were used for over a century before isotopic dating even existed. Second, one of the major ways that dating results are evaluated for presumed reliability is their agreement with relative dating based on index fossils. Consequently, the circular reasoning still stands"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Homecooking that is sure to please your family,"After watching Paula Deen on the Food Network and then visiting her restaurant, The Lady and Sons in Savannah, I knew this cookbook collection was a must for our home.  Her recipes are simple and delicious.  There is something in there for everyone with new creations that delight the palette.  Her chicken recipes such as Chicken Georgia, Chicken and Dumplings and Chicken Casserole are easy and delicious.  The Corn Casserole was probably the easiest dish I have ever prepared and was gone immediately.  It is a great sign in my home if you do not have leftovers.  I do not have leftovers when I cook with Paula Deen.  The only downside is we are having to exercise more because of this delicious food.  I figure that it is a small price to pay for having enjoyable sit down dinners with the family.  I would definitely endorse this collection for any home.  This would be a great gift this Christmas season."
books,1 of 1,2.0,Seriously outdated,"Man, you can't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied. I liked the way they presented the idea of BW, but it was seriously outdated. They should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year"
books,10 of 12,1.0,an unfortunate legacy,"I bought this book because I've read and enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's plays and I knew it was her last work. Frankly, I wish she hadn't written it. Like many other reviewers, I was reminded of books like Hollywood Wives in the first half. Parodies of lifestyles of the super-rich, like most chick lit, have about exhausted themselves. Without more, it's like been there, done that. The second half of the book, if anything, was worse. Either someone else finished it for her, or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters. Since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place, I skimmed the last few chapters. Satire is the dark side of humor. It should be witty and thought-provoking. This book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work"
books,4 of 6,5.0,"1 little, 2 little, 3 little read throughs","The first time I read it, I was confused. The second time I read it, I thought I mostly understood what was going on. This time, I get it... no, really. This work is crammed with philosophical commentary, conspiratorial speculation, new age pseudo-science, and just plain madness. I look forward to how much more I'm sure to find the next time I read it."
books,,5.0,Enjoyable Read,"""Orchid Blues"" is not a heavy, deep, dark mystery. Now that that's out of the way, the book is a good read.  If you've read ""Orchid Beach"" you are already familiar with the characters and the writing.  The hook is Holly's fianc? being killed in cold blood at the beginning of the story.  The real star in this story is Ham.  He is able to infiltrate the group of underground militia that murdered Holly's fianc?.  Yes there are several lucky breaks, but you know what this is a work of FICTION"
books,,5.0,Couldn't put it down,"Read this book!  I never thought a history book would be one I could not put down.  It's enlightening and eye-opening.  It's a broad, fascinating history."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Another Koontz entertaining yarn.,I happened to read Seize The night first. I was still pulled in to this first book in the series. The charcaters are very likable and the book left me wanting to know even more about them. Dean Koontz is one of the best writers of our time
books,0 of 14,4.0,Typography,This book is useful and straight forward. It is an excellent book for students
books,15 of 16,5.0,Best KJV Bible Available Today!!!,Some things you should know about the red-letter Cambridge KJV Cameo Bible:
books,0 of 28,1.0,Worst Book I've Ever Read,"Pretentious and boring, too clever for its own good, the only good chapters in this book are the ones about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ, and there's not enough of that."
books,0 of 1,1.0,Get to the point!,This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word
books,4 of 16,1.0,Starts out interesting then turns disgusting,"I am not one who can't handle any sort of violence or sexual deviance. However, after half of this book i had to toss it away because there was nothing redeeming about it. Every Character we encounter is wicked and sexually deranged. I need a shred of hope to contine reading especially if i am to endure such explicit rape scenes. ugh"
books,,4.0,Students will love this notebook,"The ""Reporter's notebook"" is a great tool to provide to students planning on writing and publishing a newspaper.  The notebook provides several tips and ideas for young writers in a well organized format.  There are also several pages for students to use for note taking."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Wonderfully moving memoir!,"This is a beautifully written book that makes you feel like you are in Iran at the time of the revolution. Ms. Hakakian's prose brings to life the sounds, smells and feel of life in revolutionary Iran, through the eyes of a young girl."
books,13 of 14,4.0,The Great Bust Ahead,"Very Short, (55 pages), and to the point, yet, with all of the information packed into the book, it should still take a couple of nights to read if you can put it down. Mr. Arnold has a message to get out, and he gets it said."
books,9 of 12,1.0,A Hastily thrown together book,"I've heard a lot about MS. Ray's show on the Food Network, so I thought this book might be an interesting addition to my library. I was wrong. Unfortunately I didn't scan the book before buying it, or else it would still be on the shelf. Most of my gripes have been covered now that I have read them. Un organized, no index, and to be honest, uninspiring recepies. 30 minute meals? I don't think so given the time it takes to find what's needed to create a meal, most of them seem to be the kind that were passed down by word of mouth, and not researched. Is MS. Ray a chef? I don't think so, and am not sure what her credentials actually are."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Drug Guides vs Drug Guides!,"I got this book when I started nursing school in 2003. This year (Fall 2005) as a senior, I wanted to get an updated drug guide, so I asked my Adult II instructor what she recommended, and purchased it. It was from another company, and was in shrink wrap, so I did not look at it before I purchased. The company is very reputable, but I found that the layout and content of the book not as extensive as Davis's. That was $35 down the tubes! I would like to see a newer editon of Davis's that covers the many new drugs. As soon as I do, I will purchase"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Engaging Thriller,"While Eve Dallas and her partner Peabody are interviewing a witness at the Wilfred B. Icove Center for Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery, the body of Dr. Wilfred B. Icove, Sr. is discovered. Due to the way Icove was murdered, Eve suspects a professional hit by the last person to come in contact with Dr. Icove, a mysterious young woman. As Eve investigates, she begins to suspect that there is something off about Dr. Icove's practice, and when his son is found murdered in the same manner as the father, Eve delves deeper into the doctors' pasts. What she discovers not only sickens but shocks Eve, who, with the help of her husband, Roarke, intends to put a stop to a secretive illegal, immoral, and unethical scientific experiment that involves cloning."
books,7 of 33,1.0,300 Pages of Misandry,"If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination"
books,7 of 8,5.0,Another Great Book from Joe!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Although there is nothing new in it, especially if you have read books on similar topics, Joe organizes the material in a systematic and usable way that is easy to follow. Just read the book and follow the steps! I did and within 2 weeks I had a new car! Everything he says in this book is true. Just open your mind to the possibilities and see what happens."
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Must for any Dog Owner,"The diagram of Sally's brain is great, just how I imagine it.  The illustrations are wonderful and his love for animals really shows through"
books,3 of 4,5.0,It's even funnier if you're pregnant,"I really enjoyed this book, zombie frogs, voodoo Riders, and all the perils and tribulations possible while being pregnant when I wasn't pregnant yet.  After getting pregnant, though, man, it's *really* funny and it's really obvious that the man did some real research into the problems.    Mockingbird is more easy going than some of Stewart's other books, warmer, funnier, and much more involved with the everyday things that go with someone's life with all the complexities, absurdities, and joy that goes with it.  It still has that touch of magic he brings to everything, and I highly recommend it"
books,,5.0,a great text for junior scientists,"As a graduate student, I have gradually acknowledged the hidden rules of practicing sciences that, unfortunately, has never disclosed themselves during the regular programs. This book demistifies science and its practioners in the field using scientific methodology. This book becomes my favorite text at the expanse of T. Kuhn"
books,5 of 5,5.0,"A great ""future view"" of technology...","This is a great book. The value of The Five Regions is its ability to segment the potential future applications of technology into five distinct areas, which provides for a great deal of clarity and depth. I found the book's content on technology to be especially relevant and useful. The Five Regions Assessment also allowed me to expand my own cognitive horizon on how I tend to see the various technologies in application, while also expanding my vision into new worlds of application. As always, Barker's observations are intertwined with science and research, thereby opening our eyes and our minds to fascinating possibilities. Indeed, the book also left me intrigued. I had a renewed sense of excitement about the future utilization of technology. All in all, this book is written in true Barker style. It is incredibly captivating yet understandable, stimulating, and well worth reading."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Like a college bullsession almost 40 years later,"Having been a contemporary of Atlas's at Harvard nearly 40 years ago, I was pulled back to that time when we spent hours in the womblike campus setting --priviliged to fantasize about where we were headed. In the blink of an eye, here we are, still trying to make sense of our lives -- but now dealing with all these losses of opportunities, loved ones, energy, dreams and illusions.  Atlas hits all the big issues -- death of parents, loss of job, stiffening joints, anxieties about money and marriage and status amongst peers.  It's poignant and provocative and, as Atlas has himself done many times, I, too, teared up -- facing up to the reality that there's likely a lot more living behind me than ahead.  All in all, a wonderful collection of thoughtful, poignant, sweet, and revealing musings on the beginning of the endgame from a guy who writes about the kind of stuff we'd prefer to ignore, but know we need to reflect on"
books,19 of 21,1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course...unfortunately, the instructor never even flipped through it.  It is by far the WORST photography book, really the worst book I have ever purchased!  There are typo's, the ""example photos"" and instruction sometime are not the same.  The projects are lame and really teach nothing.  I would not recommend this book under any circumstances...AVOID AT ALL COST!!! [..."
books,2 of 3,5.0,A must have for Huneck fans and animal lovers.,I bought this book for my mom as a present.  She already owns the other &quot;Sally&quot; books and loved this one too.  The illustrations are beautiful and very whitty.  My favorite is the giant moose with Sally.  The Sally books aren't just for Lab owners or children--any pet lover will enjoy them
books,,5.0,I can't wait for Year 7,"I throughly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I thought it was a little short compared to Book 5, but the story was very well developed. The only problem I had is that I will have to wait for J.K. Rowling to finish Book 7"
books,2 of 2,5.0,A great read!,This book was very well written and so much fun to read.
books,24 of 24,5.0,A marvelous confection...,I found this book in the gift shop of the Point Reyes National Seashore visitor center on a recent trip to Inverness and had to own it.
books,1 of 1,5.0,The wait is a killer!,"I pre-ordered this book, and could hardly stand the wait.  How much I had loved the first book by this author ""Thru a glass..."" and the 2nd was almost as good ""Now face to ...."".  Ms Koen has taken her story writing skills to a new and even better peak.  This is the best of the 3.  Now, I have to reread the other two since it has been so long.  I just hope she will not wait this long for a 4th book.  Or, maybe, even do a book on something else.  Don't do a ""Jean Auel"""
books,22 of 22,5.0,Lessons for both conservatives and liberals,"To hardcore conservatives who believe that the plight of the poor is no one's fault but their own, I say: Read this book. To hardcore liberals who believe the poor are oppressed by society and not responsible for their situation, I say: Read this book. ""There are No Children Here"" shows that life is more complicated than either extreme. The lives of the people in this book are governed by complex interactions of both personal choices and unavoidable bad luck. The author sympathetically examines the terrible hardships his subjects were born into, but never shies away from showing how their situation is perpetuated by the harmful behavior and relationships they choose to pursue. Whatever your ideology is going in, you will not look at poverty the same way after reading this book"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Loosing sleep over this book!,"Luxury for me is reading in bed at night after a long hard day at work. This book was so good I had a hard time putting it down, to the point of staying up until the wee hours reading! Just kept thinking ""one more page"" and before I knew it, it was 3:00 AM! It was captivating and I loved it. Never wanted it to end"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Encouragement is Like Miracle-Gro for Relationships,"I have long been a proponent of encouragement as a means to build healthy, strong relationships and promote growth. This book offers a concrete plan for making that happen. I have observed people moved to tears by a little appreciation. People are starving for love and appreciation. Don't let the people in your life suffer any longer"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Warm and wonderful,This book brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it.  It is warm and comforting.  A wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what..
books,,5.0,"Open Your Heart, Open Your Mind",This wonderful book touches the inner soul.You identify with each passage as you dissolve into reading. You appreciate the author's passages so much more if you settle in a quiet place and let your thoughts run away. Truly an easy and delighfful reader.Everyone should have this book as a reference tool.I use the passages with my students on a day to day basis.Many life lessons to be learned
books,2 of 2,5.0,Hegemony or Survival,"Provides overwhelmingly truthful information about America and the rest of the world.  It is a ""must read"" in order to understand all of the events taking place today"
books,,4.0,"Not as funny as Running With Scissors, but still worth reading.","The thing about Augusten Burroughs is this: he can take a mundane situation (like chipping his tooth while eating a bowl of soup) and turn it into a hilarious retelling. His use of similes and metaphors is often hilarious and, in general, he just has a hold on the English language."
books,4 of 11,4.0,Paleo Diet,"This version of the ""protein"" diet brings the whole eating craze back to the center where it belongs.  It just doesn't make sense to eat dripping bacon and greasy cheeseburgers without any checks and balances.  The Paleo diet calls for a sensible approach to eating lean protein as did our distant ancestors, and reinstitutes the idea that fruit and vegetables should be a mainstay.  I do wish there was a more prominent place for whole grains, but who says you have to follow Paleo exactly?"
books,4 of 4,4.0,Like Reading Throug Red Tape,"Hernando De Soto's ""The Other Path"" is a much drier read than its follow up ""The Mystery of Capital."" I'm glad I read TMC first - it gave a global economic perspective that I could relate to and which interested me in reading more of the author's work. The Other Path is very detailed in its portrayal of Peruvian politics, the intricacies of laws governing property rights and transactions, and the evolution of businesses from extralegal to legal operations. While this very book was the tool used by the Peruvian government to successfully solve its terrorism problem in the 1980s, by legalizing the economic operations of the majority of its marginalized citizens, and while its message and methods are even more relevant in the current climate of global terrorism, the step-by-step detail makes it a tedious read and I couldn't get all the way through. I will, at some point, try again, but I'm glad I read The Mystery of Capital first."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Excellent,Excellent.  This book is to Private Equity what Monkey Business is to Investment Banking and Liars Poker is to Bond Traders.  A must read for any one who deals with Wall Street
books,6 of 8,5.0,Poems for the Soul,"I saw Ms. Walker read poems from this book last night in Los Angeles.  She spoke of how she thought she was done with writing and then the poetry started one day.  She described the return to poetry as a ""spring"" beginning to flow again.  Anyone involved in creative pursuits, such as writing poetry, can surely relate to the ""spring"" metaphor.  These poems are simply beautiful and seem effortless as you read them.  They seem to come from a vast, open space.  Reading the poetry engages the reader in a celebration of life, the spirit, and hope for humanity.  Highly recommended"
books,,5.0,A Powerful Polemic on the Inner Struggles for Peace,"Since I am agnostic, I held some trepidation at reading this book, worried about excessive religious overtones. This isn't about religion. It's about living and coping with our inner demons. The protagonist is a preacher from a long line of preachers telling his family's story and his own to his son whom he knows he will not live long enough to see grow up. It is a compassionate and intimate tale of this character's inner life and ruminations, yearnings to be noble, and his baser human inclinations. It is beautifully told. What a wonderful read to find insight into the human portrait"
books,2 of 7,1.0,Women are from vaginas and men are too,"F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this ""doctor,"" is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life"
books,1 of 1,4.0,What NOT To Do When You're Expecting...,"I guess it's high praise for Mr. Iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child:  free-diving, drinking, Valium, baths in scalding water."
books,1 of 2,5.0,An incredible description of one man's journey,"Steve Kuusisto gives a moving description of growing up with visual impairments and how he learned both to live with his disability and turn it from any kind of hindrance into motivation.  His writing is poetic and  realistic.  While a little hard to read at the outset, in part because the  story is sometimes painful, following Steve as he learns to accept the help  of others and then establish personal independance is a lesson in  perseverance and self growth.  I strongly recommend it as an inspirational,  educational and literary work"
books,,4.0,A great book,I love this story. Echo lodge was great. It was about the last book where Anne is in Avonlea and a little girl. Very excellent book
books,3 of 4,5.0,Teach Yourself Photography,Excellent book for beginner photographers or even for persons who would just like to take better family or vacation pictures
books,4 of 5,4.0,"Useful, Practical, Smart","I did notice two typos, and I'm deducting a star for that, but the book was good -- an energizing, informative series of essays on leadership and communication in business and also in personal matters."
books,1 of 3,5.0,"Smart, thoughtful, intelligent, and true to life","I think some of the negative reviews here don't get it that you can have a deep, thought-provoking subplot going on, that deals with deep rooted things like religion.  I was raised in Amish country (though I'm not Amish, but I've been scarred by the Evangelicals, too) and I have thought a lot about all the things that the author writes about.  It's a great story that focuses on other areas besides just the ditsy chick-lit normal stuff.  Not that those things are bad.  This just had more substance.  Highly recommended"
books,19 of 24,5.0,Great Work,"Faux has done a really smashing job in bringing many threads into a coherent picture.  The witless rightwing reviewer who invoked Hayek, von Mises, etc., wretched wonks of the right and economic Darwinists all, did not even know what book he was reviewing - typical of the right.  The idea of transnational elites, who screw their own countrymen, is not new.  The way in Faux ties this to comtemporary economics, social movements and politics, is different and far more perusuading than the usual ""the aliens have taken over the elites"" junk available today."
books,2 of 4,1.0,I didn't like it,"Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her ""mistake,"" she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Opt for the CD--you won't regret it!,"If you've started a paperback version of one of David Sedaris's books without really getting into it I urge you to buy one of his audio books instead. Listening to David Sedaris read his own works is an entirely different experience. Over the past three years I have accumulated all of his audio books and personally, ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" is the best bang for your buck. Hearing him read his stories live--and being able to hear the audience's reaction--really make you feel like you're right there, in the room, with him. Also, his inflections are better when he is playing off the audience! The best reason to buy the Live at Carnegie Hall CD, however, is because it contains some of his absolute BEST stories including ""Six to Eight Black Men,"" ""Repeat After Me,"" ""Who's the Chef"" and ""Hejira."" The only thing missing is ""Rooster at the Hitching Post"" from ""Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim."" (A live version of ""Rooster at the Hitching Post"" is on  the aforementioned CD. ""Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim"" is also a worthy purchase. I teach a writing workshop and I can't tell you how many of his stories I have used to help students improve their writing. David Sedaris would undoubtedly find that ironic. If you've read ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" you know why.) Finally, let me offer this last selling point: if you are looking for an audio cd to listen to on your commute to and from work you can't go wrong with this or any of his other audio books. His stories generally range from ten to thirty minutes and, no matter how bad your day was, you can always trust that David Sedaris has experienced something worse. I find him to be the perfect travel companion. Do buy his CDs. Now. Today"
books,,5.0,Enjoyable tale that brings Drizzt out of the underdark,"This is the last book in the Dark Elf Trilogy that tells the tale of how Drizzt fares in the surface world. I think its a great follow up to Exile, and really puts into perspective the challenges a dark elf faces in the eyes of surface dwellers that do not want to accept him. Once again, Salvatore creates memorable characters that heavily influence Drizzt's life. He learns and gains much wisdom in this book and I think its a necessary bridge to Icewind Dale."

books,7 of 7,2.0,Aimed at the wrong audience...,"With the hotplate and microwave on the cover, you might think that this is a book of recipes that are prepared using those two items.  This is not the case.  Yes, there is a hotplate chapter and a microwave chapter, but a large number of recipes in the other 11 chapters require an oven. And even the microwave and hotplate recipes tend to require counter space, extensive preparation, and a large number and variety of ingredients."

Delightful!"
books,9 of 9,5.0,Refreshing and Innovative Perspectives,"Utterback explains ""how companies can seize opportunities in the face of technological change."" There are dozens (hundreds?) of other books on the same subject, notably those written by Geoffrey A. Moore. I rate this book so highly because it is exceptionally well-organized and well-written, because it examines several offbeat subjects (eg the development of the typewriter and the evolution of the typewriter industry, the development of the incandescent electric light), and because Utterback focuses so intensely -- and so effectively -- on real-world situations in which the ""dynamics of innovation"" are manifest. This book is very informative but also great fun to read. (Those who enjoy it as much as I did are urged to read both The History of Invention and The Lever of Riches.) Chapter 4 revisits the the dynamics of the innovation model (Figure 1-1) and then in Chapter 5, Utterback shifts his attention to developments within the plate glass manufacturing industry. In Chapter 6, he examines the innovation differences between assembled and nonassembled products. Subsequent chapters sustain the discussion of ""the power of innovation in the creation of an industry"" and then, in Chapter 9, Utterback ""draws together some of the lessons of earlier chapters and academic research to consider the relationship between the behaviors and strategies of firms with respect to technological innovation and long-term survival."" He concludes his book (in Chapter 10) by addressing ""the perennial management issue of how corporations can renew their technology, products, and processes as a basis for continued competitive vitality."" It is obvious to all of us that even the strongest product and business strategy will eventually be overturned by technological change. Ours is an age in which change is the only constant. Therefore, as Utterbach explains so carefully and so eloquently, the challenge is to accept the inevitability of change which results from technological innovation (""discontinuities"") and to sustain a commitment to cope effectively with such change. Only such a commitment ""will win the day."
books,,4.0,Great book highly recommend,I must admit iv always been a Clinton fan. Especially for the part he played in the north of Ireland. I thought the book was well written and gave an interesting account of the good and bad sides of the American political system . The book gave a great incite into the man himself and what it takes to become president.
books,7 of 33,1.0,Disappointing Read,"The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was."

The original story is set in England at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story."

books,,5.0,Rich and captivating treatment of the 1776 campaign,"This is my first book by McCullough, but I doubt it will be the last. His ability to breathe life into history is uncanny, as so many others here attest. This book covers the Revolutionary War from the declaration of war in October of 1775 through the battle at Princeton in January of 1777. It is a history of the military campaign, so much of the political maneuvering is non-existant, instead focusing on the Continental Army and its travails against the British Army, British Navy, and Mother Nature."

books,6 of 15,2.0,A Contrarian Perspective,"Among the reviewers, I am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement. It is a mixture of facts and speculation, with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them. There is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded, and I have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be. In fact, this is a self-indulgent exercise in historical erudition. I don't care what anybody else says, this is a philosophy rather than history book. The author gives a lot of facts, but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts. The author tries to integrate almost everything under the Sun into this tome, and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information"
books,,5.0,Very Good Read,"One of the books I've returned to several times, often to just one or two of the stories that I know I can count for a good time. Despite having such a limited output, I can say without hesitation that Salinger is one of my favorites. I especially appreciate the Glass family stories. I love the way the mundane becomes so real and interesting,and often funny. Check it out!, even if you're not a fan of short stories."

books,1 of 3,2.0,Cynosure Scallions on the Mountain Look Downwards (Upon?) the Zebus & Sevens,Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable
books,1 of 7,1.0,Not  worth the effort...,"I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get &quot;Born in Ice.&quot"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Introducing the new 21st century world,"This book is a must read to anyone wanting to understand the times we are living in. Friedman does a great job explaining how the world is opening up to capitalism and how the 300 million of us in the west are being joined by 3 billion from the east in our markets. With the Berlin wall coming down on 11/9/1989 and the Internet going up on 8/9/1995 the world has changed. We live in world that is ""flattening"" due to technology. People around the world are empowered by cell phones, personal computers, and web sites. The Chinese have opened up to capitalism and are now producing things cheaper than Mexico. Indian students are graduating and doing tech work for America in India, then emailing it to the US. The countries of the old Soviet Union are eager to participate in capitalism with the West.America must upgrade or jobs as they are lost to other countries, but we must realize that there will be many future jobs created with the these countries developing their own consumers and middle class. What will American Corporations profits look like with an extra 3 billion customers over the next 30 years? This book teaches us to embrace collaboration and competition through out the world. We will all be better off in the long run with lower prices and higher standards of living, if we adapt to the changing world. Why is Wal*Mart the cheapest retailer in the world? Chinese labor and logistics. While the Arab world, Africa, and most of Latin America are being left behind, China, India, and the old Soviet countries are gearing up to join the west, while currently only 2% of India and China are developing into their own middle class, the potential is incredible. This review can not do justice to the book, read it for a preview of the 21st century. Prepare for change"

The Merriam Webster Children's Dictionary is, in my opinion, more than a dictionary, it is also like an encyclopedia.  It does more than define words. It also uses great photos and illustrations to enlighten children and adults alike. One could spend hours just randomly sampling the pages. I'm sure it will be a very useful tool for the kids all through their elementary school years. I wish I had this book when I was a kid!"

books,7 of 7,5.0,King's Best: thirty years ago? Ouch,"Seriously, King's always an incredible crafstman, his characters to die for, but of all of his novels (I've read most) this STANDS out as his classic great. Later novels just feel different, even if the voice and writing is always spectacular. The Stand is less polished, but more engaging on a number of fronts. Vivid, memorable scenes. I still remember Fran biting her tongue on the beach, of all things. Characters are always real -- and that's amazing in a fantasy epic. Normally, I look to escapism and fun in fantasy, but here, the characters feel so alive and real. My one thumbs down -- and it's not enough to bring this down to four stars -- is the expanded edition was not necessary. The original was expanded enough and just right. The new opening doesn't engage me like the old one with Stu in the garage, which is a real ""Holy Crap"" sort of opening. I once read where King griped about his fans saying his ""best"" book was such an old classic. But, hey, classic is classic. This is a triumph. The only weak point, to me, was the ending. It felt rushed. Maybe not as vivid as the rest. But it was all good, anyway. I recommend this to anyone who isn't susceptible to nightmares (it's more disturbing than scary, mind you."

books,2 of 3,4.0,"kidnappers, terrorists and space stations, oh my!","in this thrilling addition to the Alex Rider series, Alex is in the hospital, recovering from a near shave with a sniper bullet, courtesy of Scorpia. While in the hospital, he befriends the friendless Paul Drevin, the son of a multi-millionaire. One night, as Alex was walking down the hallway, he saw the receptionist shot, and heard that the shooters were after Paul.Alex tricks the kidnappers into thinking he's Paul, and then leads them through the hotel, zapping one of them in the neck with defibullators, knocks another one out with a medicine ball, and tricks a man with a solid metal watch into walking into a room with an incredibly powerful magnet. That wasn't pretty. But he fergot about the fourth guy. He's captured and brought back to the headquarters of the kidnappers, who are actually the members of a terrorist oraganization, Force Three. And so it goes, with a brilliant escape from a burning building, a awsome go-kart race, a meeting with the CIA, a private island, a huge space hotel, rigged to come hurtliing down to our very own Washinton D.C."
books,14 of 17,5.0,Dated but still important,"Ledeen's book, written nearly two years before the 9/11 Commission report would have been a much cheaper and faster way for Congress to get to the same result; that the CIA has so lost its way that it will take a Herculean effort to make it effective in fighting Islamofascism. Ledeen points to the willingness of the Clinton administration to turn its head after the first attack on American soil in 1993 for the sake of political expediency. He also goes back into previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike to see how the CIA has become ""a cross between the Post Office and the Agriculture"" department in efficiency and intensity in protecting the West from the onslaught of international terrorism. The parts of the book that are most telling is what the 9/11 Commission chose to ignore, the micromanaging of the CIA by Congress which slowly but surely turned it into a eunuch in the Middle East. Former Senator Torricelli's demands for an investigation are particularly amusing given his amendment which effectively prevented the CIA from employing the kind of agents we will need to infiltrate the terrorist cells active all over the world today, including in the US."

books,1 of 1,5.0,"Intense, brilliant","With fiction there is usually some distance between the reader and the action described.  After all, the reader is seated in a comfortable chair, one assumes, in pleasant surroundings.  But such is not the case with this novel.  The distance between this reader and the story disappeared almost from the beginning, and like the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's poem, I was dragged from Ohio to Mississippi in the heat of summer and forced to witness things I didn't want to see but could not avoid."

He explores our mistaken beliefs that we are separate from the planet, and that it exists solely for  human destruction, pollution, exploitation and profit.  He encourages us to  take responsibility.  This book forever changed the way I will look at our  world.  Read it.

books,,5.0,Read It and Decide,"Just read this book and decide.  Richard Dawkins sheds some light on some very complex ideas.  Reading ""The God Delusion"" is more enlightening and lucid than reading the prose in the Holy Bible especially the King James Version with its difficult to understand 1611 English.  The updated translations (NIV, NRSV, ESV, etc.) of the Bible are easier to read but still have bizzare stories and lots of verses that contradict one another.  Christian friends of mine have explained these logical contradictions in the Bible.  Unfortunately, their explanations of the contradictions are vastly more confusing than the logical contradictions themselves (at least to me, anyway)."

books,2 of 4,5.0,One of the best time management and leadership authors wrote this book!,"Michael Masterson is one of my favorite writers.  His book ""Power and Persuasion"" hits the nail on the head when he describes the characteristics of successful business leaders (especially in chapter five).  He puts into words what I have learned and believed for years.  I found his thoughts about establishing communication routines and following up on goals to be on target.  Too many leaders try to micromanage their employees and business associates.  His comments about true delegation and recognizing different expectations of individuals increase both the leader's power and the power of those they associate.  It takes very little time to acknowledge someone's accomplishments while increasing that person's self-worth.  The result is a strong business team.  Of course a regular routine of firing the weakest performers is best when needed.  Pruning your hierarchy usually strenthens your business.  And hopefully, those individuals will learn from the experience and succeed in another business.  It is impossible to be liked by everyone, but strong leaders are usually respected.  ""Power and Persuasion"" is a must read!!!  Buy it now!!!  I know several leaders who will receive Michael Masterson's book as gifts.  Some who already have these skills and some who should learn and practice these successful business traits"
books,7 of 7,5.0,ChemE,This is one of perhaps four or five of the best books I own that deal with personal/business improvement and growth.  It is obvious that Quinn has spent years developing his approach.  His personal concern for helping organizations/businesses/individuals change is also evident.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in fresh ideas and clear thinking
books,7 of 10,5.0,Common sense and dignity,"The Concept of Mind is a great book for several reasons. The main reason to me is that Ryle clarifies the concept of being human, while he uses language in a natural way. In stead of constructing concepts based on (for  example scientific) assumptions, he shows what we already see as obvious,  just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language. He is far  from reductionistic; mark the subtle irony: 'Man need not be degraded to a  machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine. He might, after all, be  a sort of animal, namely, a higher mammal. There has yet to be ventured the  hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man."
books,210 of 214,5.0,The Best Pregnancy Book of the 5 we used.,"The greatest strength of this book is the week-by-week format. It outlines specific changes that are pretty close to exactly as predicted. We noticed many of the things and then read them that week, ie. phlegmyness, inability to travel more than an hour and dryness at night just to name a few.  This book is very well balanced and it tends to focuses more on the positives of pregnancy and not the possible complications. This is the 5th Edition of this book with millions of copies sold. Overall it is a great help. I definitely recommend it to all expectant couples. These authors also wrote a number of supporting or complimentary books:"
books,3 of 14,1.0,sophomoric,"Funny people have it bad. When they're actually making you laugh they're fine. When they're failing to make you laugh they come off as desperate, flailing nerds. I was a huge fan of Stranger with Candy whose writing was incisive and brutally funny. Less so with the Book of Liz, and even less so with this book. Sedaris, Colbert & Dinello are funny people but this is an embarassment. It's abundantly clear now that they require a format (ripe for a send-up) to shine. Was there a 2nd draft or was this a cash-in for their agents? Every joke in this nervous-to-please dud is a throwaway. A tiresome type of joke starts on page 1. By page 2 you've detected the formula and by page 3 it's just grating. The plot is the flimsiest possible structure three smart asses can bounce bad puns & jokes off of. It quickly collapses. I could not complete it but I suspect the book ends up being lightweight crap. When you commit to nothing but your own funniness you never get around to questions of merit. This is a desperately nerdy book, just as the posed ""funny"" pictures suggest. (I've never seen less funny pictures...) Who was the intended audience for this? The dumbest person I know has a more sophisticated funny bone than this."
books,20 of 33,1.0,With Great Trepidation!!!,"When I first started reading this book, I literally devoured it from page to page, believing it to be groundbreaking and a tour-de-force.  After I read it, I reflected on its message, and found I wasn't as excited as I first thought.  Then I thought about writing a review, but had to caution against emotionalism, and this kind of book certainly stirs up the pot of emotionalism."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Very Satisfying Read after slightly rough start,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters were complex and interesting, although at times a little bewildering.  The world-building was good--there was a strong sense of a developed and unique culture and magic system."

books,1 of 2,5.0,Writing good? Now write better.,"Another book about writing well? Who needs it, you ask? My answer is: Anyone who wants to write better. Those who want to be better writers must continually practice their skills. Sure, you could probably improve your style without this book, but why not learn a few more tricks of the trade? I especially enjoyed the rewrite examples (&quot;Rewriting History&quot; was particularly interesting). Expend a bit of energy reading and studying Ryan's book and then expect to write with a bit more ease. Someone once commented that even good writers need perpetual reassurance. &quot;Write Up the Corporate Ladder&quot; is that reassurance"
books,7 of 7,5.0,Marvelous New View of Musical Theater,"As a lover of Musical Theater, and (minor) toiler in the vineyards, myself, I have probably read hundreds of books on the subject. Therefore, it is always a special treat to find one that brings a fresh slant to the subject. Jones' book does just that. By treating musical theater styles neither as a simple reflection of, nor an escape from the world at large, but rather as an integral part of the whole, he presents a broad, but always entertaining and on-target view of both the 20th century and musical theater's part within same. There are, as there always are in works of this scope, some factual errors (e.g. &quot;No Strings&quot; wasn't Richard Rodgers' only &quot;public&quot; credit as a lyricist. He's also so credited on the score for the TV musical &quot;Androcles &amp; The Lion&quot;. It ain't Broadway-in every sense-but it IS public!) but none that take anythng away from the over-all achievement of the work"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Captain Nemo & The Nautilus,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like ""Vexed"" ""Zoophytes"" and ""Connoisseur."" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant ""Narwhal"" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner.

books,2 of 6,1.0,Too Blue,"I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: ""sophistication""? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s."

Although I don't always agree with his views, I have always been impressed by his basic fairness and honesty (on the whole) since I read ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea,"" a thoroughly delightful work on evolutionary thought.  Thus when one of my colleagues loaned me ""Breaking the Spell"" Religion as a Natural Phenomenon""  I was prepared for an interesting exposition.  Unfortunately, I only had a chance to peruse the book, rather than read it in detail, but I got the main ideas and I did read some sections more thoroughly."

books,13 of 30,2.0,"If you like books about unicorns, read this","I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as &quot;national character&quot;? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the &quot;inside view&quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian &quot;character&quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you"

books,,5.0,A thought provoking piece,"A Tme to Kill, the debut novel from Acclaimed writer John Grishman deals with the thinly threaded storylines dealing with a rape and attempted murder of a [young] black girl.  Soon after race issues boil over as protesters on both sides of the fences barrier over the woodwork. Grishman expertly narrarates this complex issue by focusing on the more simplistic, organic notions of the case, and the bodies that are affected by each decision that is made.  True, the ending seems rather rushed and he certainly could of filled another 50-100 pages without question, but in the long run everyone believes that this magnificent story of Racial disharmony in present day and age end up asking, not answering, questions that need to be asked. Grishman was quoted in the reprinted foreword in saying he wouldn't change a word.  With a story like that, you can see that he doesn't need to, compelling storytelling will always be compelling storytelling. In the End Grisham nails it out of the park, and leaves his readers yearning for more"

It's very easy to attract children's eyes, and easier to attract the eyes of teenagers who have a kid's heart just like me!"
books,1 of 1,4.0,The Villa - Good Reading,"I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline (Falcon Crest revisited) of The Villa.  The characters, plots and descriptions of the Napa Valley as well as a lesson in ""great"" wine making only add to the saga of the Giambelli family and the corporate espionage that unfolds during the course of the novel.  I particularly enjoyed the relationship development of Pilar and David Cutter and while some readers felt that Sophia's character was a bit cold, I enjoyed watching her ""tough guy-hard shell"" antics soften as she accepted the love of a man and the warmth and care that he brought forth with that love.  The climax and the revealing of the villain was a complete surprise to me.  I had narrowed it down to two people (neither of which were the actual killer) and never guessed the real ""bad guy"" until it was all played out."
books,1 of 3,4.0,I'm not a huge fan of chic lit,"or any book written in the first person, but i did enjoy this book.  The heroine was flawed, which i liked, but the hero was a saint, which I didn't quite believe.  Oh, don't get me wrong, Walter is a man any woman would want, but the big question is WHY did he want Wanda?  Even so, I thought the book was better than average."

books,7 of 9,2.0,Interesting And Disappointing,"When I received this book I was really eager to read it. The whole storyline appealed to me and I was convinced, based on the first few chapters, that I would enjoy it.  I'm not sure when I changed my mind.  Maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political China when I just wanted to know more about the main characters.  Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story.  While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side.  I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts.  Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing.  The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable.  To me, that's a deal-breaker"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Unlike anything ever recorded,"I had studied Greek history for quite some time before I finally did myself the greatest favor thus far in my life and purchased Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War for my collection.  At the time I had already read Herodotus at least 3 or 4 times in full, along with all sorts of other Greek texts available.  I was in love with Herodotus, enjoying with skepticism his regaling of myths as fact, particularly the presense of oracles and their relation to the events he described, which still fascinates me in spite of the doubt I feel towards divine intervention.  At that point I had known of Thucydides at some time, but it was not until I had exhausted almost every available source of Spartan knowledge did I at last turn to him."

Despensing of unnecessary elements like thought balloons, he relies entirely on dialogue and visuals.  His style is spare, unlike many of his more mainstream peers, and his narratives are far removed from the spandex exploits of Superman or Batman.

The data themselves are quite compelling, even if the writing style is not."

But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me"
books,23 of 27,5.0,A compelling account of technology revolutions,"This is a fascinating and chilling account of technological innovation. It belongs on the recommended list of technology managers and staff alike.  Utterback marshals compelling case histories that provide the objective  foundations for more popular accounts of technology formation such as  Geoffrey Moore's CROSSING THE CHASM (1). We gain insight into why it's so  crowded at the bottom.  Reasons exist in abundance why firms that epresent  established technology are the least likely to perceive the threat  represented by radical innovation.  It is a slight exaggeration to say  Utterback makes current management sound like the last Czar of Russia  praising the happiness of the serfs. Yes, perhaps the serfs were happy; but  the Bolsheviks weren't. In short, the technological discontinuity is not  going to come from established competitors. All the electric typewriter  manufacturer's were &quot;taken down&quot; by the Word Processor. But how  then to recognize the radical innovation?      The key to Utterback's  argument is the idea of a &quot;dominant design&quot; of a technology  It  forms the center of a network of system features, user habits, collateral  assets such as brand image, market channel and customer switching costs. By  definition, the dominant design wins the market.  It is the pattern to  which both competitors and incremental innovators must adhere to if they  aim at significant following in the current market.  It is what radical  innovation over-throws.   Many case histories are provided.     Each of the  chapters illuminates an aspect of the dynamics of innovation by drilling  down into a specific example.  Thomas Edison came late to the race to  produce a commercial electric lamp.  He succeeded through ingenuity and  systematic thinking.  From the start, he planned for scalability, aiming to  deliver  electricity through the very illuminating gas conduits that formed  his major competitors' delivery system.  He also laid down a network of  patents as he worked; and legally pursued those who tried to steal his  mechanisms. Utterback's other examples include the Qwerty typewriter key  board (an example as powerful as it is elegant and simple), the  BM-compatible PC, the Cray computer, the INTEL-based massively parallel  computer, the ball-point pen, the float process of making plate glass,  celluloid (Kodak) film, the incandescent light bulb, the INTEL x86 chip,  and a dozen other engaging from the history of economics.  A fascinating  account of cutting  natural ice from the Lakes of New England in the mid  1800s should  have a sobering - I almost wrote chilling -- effect on the  complacent technology manager. Here radical innovation means one thing:  refrigeration.  Paradoxically, the ice industry, which efficiently  transported harvested ice as far away as India, was unable to envision  refrigeration.  Industry outsiders were the ones.  Why?  According to  Utterback, industry insiders have a heavy investment, both technological  and  emotional, in the existing system of infrastructure, distribution, and  production.  &quot;...From a practical point of view, their managerial  attention is encumbered by the system they have - just maintaining and   marginally improving their existing systems is a full-time  occupation.&quot;   They are ripe for the process which the economist  Schumpeter described (2) as &quot;creative destruction.&quot; (Utterback's  book exemplifies how Schumpeter is reborn as the intellectual god-father  among the Silicon Valley - ideas-as-economic-drivers -- mind set.)  Thus,  innovation shows up as a game of chutes and ladders. A new technology  represents a ladder to get off the slope of incremental progress and jump  to another level.  The chute is the path by which managers dedicated to the  customers of the about-to-be obsolete technology follow it into oblivion  and obscurity.  This is a grim prospect, and, according to Utterback's  cases, one that occurs about 70% of the time. In the case of David and  Goliath, history is on the side of the sling shot.  How do the lucky few  reinvent themselves?   This possibility is appreciated by Utterback, who  provides the examples of HP and Motorola. But the  examples of what doesn't  work are legion.  Discounted cash flow will rarely (never) fund risky,  radically innovative projects.  Compromises like DEC's simultaneous pursuit  of VAX and MIPS chips, with one foot on each side of the chasm, helps to  explain how DEC ended up its bottom.  Assigning the new technology  initiative to the establishment department is like asking the Philistine  Goliath to be little David's mentor.  If a state-of-the-art lab is  established, then you may end up with XEROX PARC, which invented modern  computing without benefiting XEROX.  Of course, you may end up with  Edison's Menlo Park work shop or Bell Labs. So this approach - though risky  - is a gamble with pay-off prospects.  A diversified portfolio of R&amp;D  projects is part of the equation.  But equally important are top  management's commitment, patience, and persistence.  The enterprise-wide  nurturing of core competencies in marketing and distribution, as well as  product design and implementation, are on the critical path to firm-wide  renewal.  Finally, reading Utterback's text itself would be useful step for  technology managers in understanding how to cross, instead of ending up at  the bottom of, the chasm of technological discontinuity and innovation.

Just letting people who are interested know that they can purchase it online at www.drfuhrman.com, since it is currently unavailable here.  As a testment to this way of eating, I can say that it works wonders and should you buy it and follow Dr. F's suggestions, be rest assured that your cholesterol will return to a normal range.  Right now I can tell you that Dr. Fuhrman recommends eating large amounts of vegetables, esp. green ones like kale, spinach, bok choy, broccoli, brussel sprouts and lettuce, as well as fruits, and small amounts of beans, nuts and seeds.  If this does not sound appealing to you, I would definitely give it a shot anyway.  It is not as if you will be eating these foods on their own. Dr. F provides delicious recipes in the book and has many more delicious ones on his website.  Also, this is your health we are talking about.  I think it would be worth trying new or unfamiliar foods in the quest to regain your health.  Also, as a follower of Dr. F myself, I would like to say that he has mentioned that taste buds can actually change over time.  I am learning that in myself now.  I used to despise brussel sprouts and now I am not repulsed and will eat them on occasion.  Quite a shocker, I know.  But if you are a skeptic, read Dr. F's books, try his diet and then tell me I am wrong."

It is written in a poetic way that makes you think, reflect and enter into the fantastic world of the invisible cities of Kublai Khan's empire, created by Calvino. Marco Polo works for the Khan. He has to visit many towns of the Mongolian empire so that later he can share his impressions with the great Khan. This is mainly because the empire is so big that Kublai Khan would never be able to visit all towns of his empire."

""Legal Writing in Plain English"" contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney.  Some of these are obvious (e.g., use a readable typeface), while others are more nuanced (e.g., delete perhaps the legal drafter's favorite legalism, ""provided that"").  Each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal -- be a good writer so that your reader doesn't have to work so darn hard to understand you."

Bookshops here in the Philippines don't carry Cambridge bibles so we have to order them abroad.  One of the first things you notice about the cameo cambrdige bible is the craftsmanship that went into its production.  The Calfskin leather binding is indeed a joy to hold, supple but strong. The type is so readable they seem to jump out of the pages.  Of course nothing beats the cadence of the King James version of the Holy Bible, it is unsurpassed for devotional reading and inspiration.  Mine has the zipper closure that will protect the gold edged  pages for a very very long time. The references, dictionary, concordance and maps make this handy sized bible a veritable treasure of bible helps.  As a Pastor I own several bibles and versions, but none can compare with the quality of the Cameo reference King James Bible. It may cost more than the regular bibles available here but hey they don't make bibles like these anymore.   If the Bible is the eternal word of God, doesn't it make sense to purchase one that will last a lifetime"

Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way."
books,7 of 7,4.0,Great Man -- Good Book,"Autobiography that starts two generations ago. Those readers accustomed to the usual self-serving political memoir will be plesantly surprised. McCain's book begins with mini bios of both his father and his grandfather, hence the title. While the early third of the book dealing with his family tree may be a bit slow going once he gets into his own bio in the middle third, the book really starts to heat up."

books,4 of 4,5.0,A wonderful book with beautiful photography,"The photography in this book is beautiful.  Ms. Scott captures the innate beauty and emotions of every dog she photographs.  Just by looking at these dog faces, one can get a sense of the hardship, the longing, and the hope of these canines.  The stories behind each dog gives them such depth and character.  Of course, these stories leave the reader/viewer filled with emotions including sadness and joy, but most importantly, they provide a reminder of just how precious shelter dogs are and just how much they want and deserve to be loved."
books,4 of 7,5.0,Great book with a lot of good information,"I am almost finished with the book, and although I have not done the 7-day detox yet, I am very excited about trying it.

I can't wait to try it"
books,0 of 2,4.0,Exceptional Writing - Disappointing Ending,"If you like quality writing, this is it! Mr. Wolfe is extremely talented at painting an entire scene with words that leave you feeling like you are there. Character, scene, and plot development all have depth. And I'll have to disagree with an earlier review that said the characters weren't believable. They were entirely ""human"" with all the rich exceptions that make a person who he or she is. I also disagree with the comment that the book, itself, was racist. No, the book wasn't, but some of the characters were, which was a point that Mr. Wolfe was attempting to make about them because their racism had to do with the larger story. I will most definitely read Mr. Wolfe again because of his extraordinary writing abilities. That said, I was completely disappointed with the ending, both because of specifically how he chose to end it and because of its weakness. The ending lacked the full-bodied development that Mr. Wolfe gave to the rest of the story"

They asked in disbelief, where did you go in the car? I said, Nana and Pop just laid me on the floor of the car. This book proved to my kids that I was telling the truth about the dangers kids and babies lived through back then--and all the jaw-droppingly unbelievably bad advice mothers were given."

books,1 of 1,2.0,"Sluggish, Uneventful, Corny and Borrrrring","I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what ""Insomnia"" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted."
books,6 of 8,5.0,A Great Read About an Even Greater Man,"Easily one of the best written Lincoln biographies of the last quarter century but not of all time. Donald's book has been labeled a masterpiece and while it comes close, I myself wouldn't go so far. I think it's an easy book to read and it flows very well. However, David Herbert Donald made the mistake (in my opinion) of leaving out the text of Abraham Lincoln's greatest speeches and letters (ex: the Gettysburg Address)if even for reference. Other than that, it is an amazing story of an amazing man. Abraham Lincoln has inspired many over the years and truly came from the most humble of beginnings to become the savior of the American Republic - one of the first American dreams realized. After reading this book, I guess the one thing I previously didn't comprehend is how Lincoln wasn't a hero during his presidency nor was he a master statesman - as history has since rightfully judged him to be.  No matter how much you read about Lincoln, his life never ceases to amaze. ""Lincoln"" is good brief general biography of this amazing man and well worth the effort."

Why should we as humans push aside the only life that we know for sure we will have in hope for another.What you see is what you get, is as far as it goes; at least that is all we know for sure.  Faith is good, I do say that, but when Faith starts pushing reality to the side is when we have a problem"

It is an excellent tool to teach the kids how to create great artciles for the newspaper.  We used the Intervew section as a guide when we interveiwed teachers in the school.  I highly recommend the book!  The children use the book as reference tool, even in the Middle School"
books,3 of 3,2.0,Not for me,"I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked."

Dan Brown is an excellent story teller and this book was absolutely marvelous from the first page to the last. Mr. Brown must have done an extensive amount of research to write this book since there were many scientific and technological facts included. I am not what you might call a very avid reader. ""Deception Point,"" however, had me hooked! This book has many great elements to it: thrills, suspense, sexual humor, and humor in general. I found myself laughing quite a bit while flipping through the pages of this excellent read! Kudos to Dan Brown for an excellent story!"

Atlas is an ace at capturing feelings, painting relevant flashbacks, describing current emotions and perspectives -- all of which makes this ""writer's writer"" a pleasure to read.  But most of all, the book is a gem because of Atlas' frankness and candor: he lays bare his feelings and emotions which only serves to comfort those who have reached that point when, as Bill Clinton said on a recent birthday, there are more yesterdays than tomorrows."

books,7 of 8,5.0,Renewal of Indian wars,"Margaret Coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and describes the Arapahoe customs in wonderful detail.  In this installment, Father O'Malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians has been re-ignited, and that dead Indians can be found on an ancient battle ground.  When Father O'Malley goes to investigate, he discovers three dead Shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles. Things heat up when the young Shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends.  Vicky Holden, the other main character in the series, has entered into a law partnership with Adam Lone Eagle, and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling.  Vicky wants to defend Frankie Montana, who is a suspect in the murders, and Adam tries to persuade her not to take Frankie as a client.  As always, author Coel creates a wonderful setting and characters, and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series."
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Fun, light read","Another funny girly story from Sophie Kinsella.  The heroine is a work-obsessed, intelligent, perfectionist, go-getter career gal -- a female archetype that I could totally relate to (smile!)

I liked this book because it shows how we women can transform ourselves into whatever we set our minds to"
books,3 of 5,5.0,One of Flynn's best books,"Although he's been publishing books for a little while, I still tend to think of Vince Flynn as one of the new faces in spy fiction.  Compared to folks like LeCarre, Clancy, Higgins or Deighton, Flynn is a youngster, but that doesn't mean he can't hold his own against the veterans.  In fact, compared to Tom Clancy (who in certain stylistic ways, is probably who Flynn is most similar to), Flynn is actually the better writer.  In Consent to Kill, he again delivers a high-caliber, fast reading thriller."

It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.
books,6 of 7,5.0,"The title is a bit misleading, but...","Okay, the title is misleading in that reading this book doesn't mean you won't be lied to, it simple means that you will be able to notice when you have been lied to, and the book gives some great tools in learning how to redirect the conversation in order to get at the truth."

books,30 of 32,4.0,"Some flaws, but overall a really useful book","The good: the author's room plans actually take into account furniture placement around windows and glass doors as well as entry points. Her examples show REAL homes with odd, mismatched furniture. Clear before and after pictures and floor plans, even if they are in black and white. She has some good rules of thumb to at least think of, which you may or may not agree with, and tends toward the neutral (white/beige) as far as paint--you can always add color with your choice of furnishings and art. She tells you which one should win out between beautiful view and fireplace when you have both in a room."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Funny and True,"After seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book.  This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today.  Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading.  That takes talent, in my book.  In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics).  You cant help but root for Bridget."

Those are both monotheistic religions (to me, they are both atheistic religions, given that there isn't any difference to me between believing in one God or zero).  So why did I read this book?  Because the author and I are both Zionists!  And I want to see what he has to say."

Technical books can quickly turn into fire kindling if there details that are not fully explained, but so far I have not found a single character of code that is not explained in the book. The book also manages to not be a ""Bible"" on C, it only presents key programming tools and common, practical programs. An awesome book for both beginners and those who are familiar with programming and simply need the C vocabular"

books,28 of 35,5.0,The beginning of a great series of juveniles,"Let's say this right up front: &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot; is not Heinlein's best novel.  But it just might be his most influential work, and given that the competition ranges from &quot;Stranger in a Strange  Land&quot; to his early groundbreaking science fiction before WWII, that's  saying a great deal.  After his return from civilian service for the Navy,  Heinlein wanted to break out of the pulps he'd written for before the war.   He didn't want to stay trapped; he wanted to write for the slicks, for  girls, for boys, for the movies, for nearly every market that he could  break into.  &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot; is not his first novel -- he'd  written several novel-length works for the pulps.  But it is his first work  specifically written for young boys, and the first of the dozen or so  juvenile classics to follow.  Heinlein's greatest literary hero, Mark  Twain, had written for boys; the market seemed open to him, and the money  looked good.  Heinlein always loved teaching young people, and this novel  would prove his greatest triumph in that regard.  Yes, the storyline is  somewhat hard to believe: three high-school age boys get taken to the moon.   But that was right in the tradition of the Tom Swift novels that had sold  so well to young boys.  Yes, the ending is corny to us now, with Nazis on  the moon: but in 1947, the Nazis has just been defeated, and they had been  the world's greatest rocket scientists: it seemed perfectly plausible in  1947.  The novel hasn't dated well in some respects; the dialogue is a bit  cheesy, and the characters are a little hard to tell apart.  But it still  moves with great excitement, and the science hasn't dated very badly at  all; Heinlein's experience developing high-pressure suits proved sufficient  to create a space suit remarkably like that later developed.  So why is  this novel so influential?  Because it was read by hundreds of young men  and women who went on to work in the Apollo program in the sixties;  Heinlein, in this very novel, had convinced them going to the moon was  exciting, achievable, and important.  If any work of fiction has that kind  of impact, it deserves to be read.  But in and of itself, &quot;Rocket Ship  Galileo&quot; is still a page-turner, and a wonderful read.  Enjoy"

After all, he's not attracted to girls, and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half-naked guys in the locker room.  He's never had an actual experience with another guy, though, so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he'll outgrow--or maybe not."
books,2 of 3,5.0,MENS SANA,"There is no getting away from the noun 'mind'. It is perfectly intelligible and sensible to say that Newton, Hume and Richard Bentley had fine minds. However we soon get into a muddle when we misunderstand what kind of noun 'mind' is. People possess certain capacities that we call 'mental' by way of distinguishing them from capacities of the senses such as eyesight, or from capacities of the physique like weight-lifting, and anything that is `mental' is of the mind. And immediately we have to watch our step if we want to think clearly. Bentley, Bentley's eyes and Bentley's eyesight can each be said to have had the capacity to read the text of Manilius. Bentley and Bentley's eyes (but not Bentley's eyesight) can each be said to have read Manilius. However what enabled Bentley to correct and edit the text of Manilius was his mind, but Bentley's mind didn't edit Manilius, Bentley did."

The ""timeline"" format allows the reader to follow multiple stories at the same time and understand the context in which they occurred.  Mrs. Cheney's succinct prose is complemented by a compilation of interesting quotations from many of our country's most famous (and some not as famous but no less important) figures.  This book is a great starting point for anyone looking to reacquaint themselves with our country's past. I find myself using it as a reference for placing specific events within a larger context, which has helped me gain a greater appreciation for the complex story of America.  A great gift for graduating high school students or your favorite college grad, as well as for anyone who enjoys American history."

books,2 of 3,4.0,Come On,"People that say this book changed your life and that if you get it it is the best book and the only book you need, clearly didn't get the book. That is the antithesis of one of the main points of the book.The point is that ""teaching"" is wrong, striving to ""learn"" is wrong. You have to find the answers within yourself, you have to truly see and hear yourself without your ego clouding the truth. This is the way to happiness and ""enlightenment"" The point of this book is that you cannot learn what it shows/tells you. You must find it within yourself, you must experience it yourself. The point is that a book on enlightenment on spirituallity can never truly show you these things can never bring enlightenment to you, that is something that must be discovered within yourself. You must strive for it, go through hardships for it, it cannot be handed to you or it loses all value."

It is a beautiful book and the children absolutely loved it.  Robert Sabuda's TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS got the same reactions.  They are amazing books and I highly recommend them to other teachers, even up to third grade.  The children could not wait for me to turn the pages.

While I do not agree with all of the topics in the book,(some are a little out of date) there are some very interesting topics, I especially like the piece about the illusion of free third level education and what the authors purpose instead.

books,2 of 12,1.0,Not Much of a Holiday,"Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, ""aren't I hilarious?"" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book."
books,1 of 2,2.0,760 Pages of Torture,"Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the ""secret"" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call ""soap opera"" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot"
books,4 of 5,5.0,You'll be testing your dog's intelligence in NO TIME.,"The Intelligence of Dogs by Stanley Coren takes a unique approach to assessing the intelligence of our canine companions.  Coren is a psychologist and animal behaviorist and uses some innovative methods, typically used to measure human intelligence, on dogs.  He gives interesting background information on canines and how philosophers once viewed them as biological machines incapable of thinking or feeling.  This book would be helpful to a person trying to decide on a breed for a pet because of the breed specific information provided.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Man's Best Friend and whats going on in his mind."

books,1 of 3,2.0,Still trying to figure it out...,"The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery.  Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off."
books,0 of 5,2.0,Wal-Mart is a big lovely bundle of sunshine,"I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult."
books,,5.0,What a novel should be,"I am not a fan of using the same protagonist in many novels.  I tend to think that it's a result either of laziness on the part of the author (the protagonist being so close to his own voice that to strike out with another character would be too difficult) or the desire to cash in on the success of previous novels with the same character.  I put those issues aside to read this book anyway and I was very happy that I did.  Thankfully, there was no need to be familiar with the other books.  The details in this book of the politics of Zuckerman's youth, the glove factory, and the anguish at losing his daughter to the world make this a great novel.  I have a terrible memory for the characters and events of stories, but this one remains with me.  I've added several other of Roth's book to my future reading list"
books,27 of 29,5.0,Another wonderful book from Cook's Illustrated,"I own four other cookbooks from the editors of Cook's Illustrated, and I subscribe to their two magazines.  Their recipes are consistently delicious, easy to follow, and compliment-garnering.  This ""Cover & Bake"" cookbook is no exception.  I have made five dishes so far, and each one has been a 'Wow!' The flavors are absolutely fantastic.  The preparation is smooth, uncomplicated, and quick.  These are recipes I will make again not only for my husband and myself, but for company, as well.  Yes, they are THAT GOOD (truly, the Smothered Pork Chops alone will make you swoon).  I appreciate the equipment and food brand recommendations throughout the book, as well as the clear explanations on food preparation technique.  This is a cookbook to get excited about"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Amazing book,I read that book in French (Le Testament Franais) so it may be possible that the English translation isn't as good as the French one.  I found that book so wonderful and the progression of the boy from childhood to adulthood is so well described.  The images that Makine creates are beautiful and you can clearly see them.  It's an excellent book for the ones who like to think and to dream
books,9 of 10,5.0,A Classic that deserves more attention. Plus its funny!,"The book is a collection of intertwining, often hilarious, stories of various natures, styles, and character: gothic, romance, a singular mathmatician, erotica, chivalry, adventure, greed, religion from many perspectives. It seems that this novel deserves to be more popular, it fits the modern attention span with its substratum of vignettes, and the larger grand story that encompasses them, a timeless tale. The book is funny and the message profound, but of the bewildering conundrum sort that some great poems often leave one with, as the story intertwines the symbols of various lives into something that was mature and introspective but uplifting and cathartic -- it doesn't rely on words but on situations to do this; so probably losses little in translation as many poems do. If anything it leaves one with stronger sense of brotherhood and love for one's neighbor. Definitely fits with modern multiculturalism, or what it should be anyway, and I guess the author was also a Freemason; a strange bag of humanism. I will never forget some of the images, Potocki had quite an imagination."
books,4 of 4,4.0,A million to one!,"War of the Worlds has come and gone in many different incarnations but I kinda just knew that none of them were really being faithful to HG Wells' original story, especially the mis-judged Spielberg/Cruise flick. So I decided to give the book a shot since it was cheap and this particular printing by The Modern Library looked rather sleek and sexy. I know it's sad, but I like my books to look good."
books,5 of 5,4.0,****1/2 - more than just a mystery,"The Boston based author, Dennis Lehane, wrote a great detective story with a social background so great, it is almost more important than the plot.

books,12 of 14,4.0,Don't be a sucker again!,"This should be a book that every consumer should read.

Andrew Grove was at the center of this company from its inception, and this is his story in his own words."
books,2 of 6,5.0,A Million Little Pieces - James Frey,"This is a book written from the heart; filled with deep soul searching and honesty. I'm familiar with alcohol and drug addiction. I'm familiar with treatment centers. For those of you who know this road - this book touches home. For those of you who don't - don't be the first to throw that proverbial 'stone'. I've heard the reports of the 'untruths' regarding this publication. I read it anyway. Pain is an immense ocean. The depth of that ocean is different for each of us. This 'message' could be a gift for many; a starting point, a different way of looking at life and it's unkind lessons. This book offers an open hand to start you on a journey towards reality; toward clarity. For those of you who belittled this book - be it truth or sensationalism - be cautious! You never know what life holds for you or yours around the next bend. The information offered here, the idea of taking that 'first step towards recovery', the process of becoming HONEST with yourself and others, could well be the salvation for someone you love. Yep, it's got some rough language. Did you really expect anything else from a drug addict? Common! Gimme' a break! Get real with yourself! Keep an open mind and dig into this book! It's a good read!"
books,3 of 3,5.0,I love it.  Good for Lightwave users too.,"I was very impressed with the style and format of this book.  It was very helpful and packed with tons of information.  I did however have some trouble modeling my head in maya, so I switched and modeled it in Lightwave acording to the format Jason wrote of in his book.  I was able to save the model as an .OBJ file and opened it in maya.  I still haven't textured the head yet, but I will and it looks soo good.  I can't wait to start animating my head.  Thank you Jason for your insight into the 3D world and for writing this book.  Very well written and wonderful diagrams.  Perfect for any 3D modeler"

books,13 of 13,5.0,Terrific synopsis of the classic historical writings on power.,"This book is a no holds barred open discussion of raw power, entertainingly presented.  It took me a little while to get over the almost completely amoral tone of the book, but I eventually got the sense that the amoral tone is there for a purpose: to clue you in to the fact that people who practice power at this level can often be completely amoral themselves.  In that sense, the book truly gives the reader a sense of the mindset of those who will do anything to stay in power.   There is a sense as one reviewer pointed out, that the book could have been written without this amoral tone, but then one would miss out on the opportunity of being immersed in its sense of amorality, which is an education in itself.  Experiencing the amorality is a wakeup call that offers insight into how some of the world's ills have come to pass, though you may find yourself wanting to shower afterward.  After reading it, you will definitely be more aware of the laws being played out on the world stage, and you will begin to recognize people in government who seem to be using it as a playbook.  Some laws are even applicable in personal relationships...a scary thought."
books,,1.0,"Cheesy, corny, lame, hokey","What a terrible story, was unable to finish it, Stuart Woods was at one time a very good author, but when he started with Holly and Stone, he in effect quit writing, this is about a militant band of right wingers robbing banks and oh by the way just had to kill Holly's intended just an hour before the wedding which didn't seem to break Holly up all that much as she still has her best friend, her dog and her father which she has conversations with regarding three somes and their sex lives in general, Signet books and Stuart Woods should both be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market."

With the novel's complexities, I never would have been able to understand the book with out this helpful companion. The book follows the novel in chapters pointing out everything that you may have missed.  Much of what was pointed out I did infact miss never thinking Pynchon might have been using an illusion or just not understanding what the illusion was.  This book is a must"

This newest book (and PBS series) brings us his approach to ""fast food"" which I think is meant with a wink and a smile.  It's only fast in the time sense!  I'm a serious foodie and this is real cooking; equally useful for family meals or entertaining."
books,,5.0,Classic Crichton - much different than his latest works.,"I have read most of Crichton's books. I obviously got sucked into his books with Jurassic Park, Congo, and Sphere. I have continued to read his books through Prey and State of Fear. Crichton's writing has evolved from a lot of science woven into an action story to overwhelmingly science heavy with a good story underneath that."
books,11 of 12,5.0,"Detailed, Scholarly Manhattan in the 1920's...","I don't know why this awesome book has negative reviews here. It is a little difficult true. But for a New Yorkphile, like me, it can't be beat, if you want to know New York in the 1920's, and to a lesser degree the nation. All the familiar names are covered: Scott and Zelda, Woolcott, Parker, Gerstein Stein, Freud,Jazz and Ellington among many others. New York as a huge rush for outsiders from their first sight. The skyscraper boom, and builders and architects. The movie industry.The extreme dangers of transatlantic flights, and coast to coast mail deliveries. The Harlem Renaissance, basically the city as a reinventing, percolating tornado.FDR, Damon Runyan,Irving Berlin,WEB Dubois,Singing the Blues, Mary Pickford,  Babe Ruth, Jimmy Walker (the fun loving mayor with questionable morals)the Great White Way, the Cotton Club...It is just about an endless ride thru this great town in the 1920's and beyond, including the aftershock of the 1930's...Sometimes a little difficult, but you can browse through the index too and find hundreds of worthy subjects to check out...One of the best journeys through a time and place that I know!! Also with some interesting photos too"
books,6 of 6,5.0,One of the Best Voices in Essays,"What I find most admirable in Sarah Vowell's work is the way it illuminates what's possible in essay writing. While her work is often well-researched, she is not writing journalism exactly, nor is she writing analysis--though she's unafraid of pulling a quotation from Nick Carraway, Huck, or the Corleones into any discussion--nor, despite the strong presence of her own voice, is she writing a pure ""personal essay.""  Her most successful work defies categorization simply by using whatever comes in handy at the moment.  The subtitle ""Stories form the New World"" suggests the loose theme of these essays, the bred-in-the-bones idealism of this country that any sensible person resists and feels nonetheless.  Besides being someone worth spending time with, Sarah Vowell creates prose like clear, cool water.  She speaks through words, not into them, and that is a too-rare phenomenon among essayists"

The collection itself was recognized by fans in the Astounding/Analog All-Time Polls in 1952 and 1956 where it ranked 8th and 17th respectively.  The stories in this collection are chronological with respect to Heinlein's Future History.  These are some of the classic stories from Heinlein's early writings.  This is definitely a must read for anyone who likes Science Fiction."
books,0 of 1,5.0,Stunning,"This book is a meditation on faith and what it means to be a moral person.  It's pace is slow, yes, but the insights are profound and the language precise and elegant.  John Ames struggles with his faith in an almost physical way throughout the novel; it's a noble struggle and real.  For in the end, only hard-won faith, doubted, contradicted, second-guessed, and tested, is worth anything"
books,8 of 18,1.0,I Wonder If That Soapbox Is Ancient-Forest Wood,"I was very much looking forward to recieving this title from Amazon.com after reading the first few pages online. And, admittedly, I did like the first few chapters; however, the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly, and became almost smug and self-aggrandizing. The authors seemed far too pleased with themselves, and, by approximately the halfway point I felt as if I were reading some kind of bizzare Conservationist Manifesto. I like to think - as a self-appointed conservationist and vegan - that I try to mind Mother Nature and all living creatures, but after I finished reading this repetitive, pedantic bore, I lost the will to care. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter; then, it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant. Others liked the book, and that's fine; But I was disappointed"
books,7 of 8,4.0,Good Introduction to Historicism,"This is a good introduction for those who are interested in a comprehensive, but not in-depth, review of the historicist view. Wohlberg covers a lot of ground in 200 pages, so he does not look at alternative interpretations of passages or examine potential textual difficulties. He simply presents the interpretation as he sees it. This is appropriate to the book's intended audience, however, which appears to be a popular audience, not a scholarly one."

books,2 of 5,2.0,Great company and leader - Outdated and dubious book,"I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair."

In this well-written and easy-to-read account of a troubled life that eventually leads to an attempted suicide, we learn the true story behind the sensational headlines/video footage of a young woman's leap from Wisconsin's tallest bridge. Battling severe postpartum depression after the birth of her second child, coupled with unresolved traumas of sexual abuse by her stepfather that began at the tender age of five, we indeed learn why Tina Zahn jumped."

It could easily be titled &quot;How to Eat an Elephant.&quot;  Every few days, I open to a different page and find out how to make my life sane.  The author has done a great job of helping me approach very difficult household tasks and become good at them.  This is after all another skill those of us who are not obsessively compulsive need to learn in order to survive life on the edge!  So far her ideas have gone down better and have saved me real time and real money by not having to re-buy what I know I have already bought but can't couldn't find if you had a gun to my head!  Her writing style is crisp and light and she approaches the negative emotion of why these tasks are so distasteful.  As you read you feel she is right there at your kitchen table to help you through the tough spots.  Enjoy"

books,3 of 5,5.0,I completely agree with Richard Petty (see below),"A fantastic, wonderful book! As a journalist researching my own book at the moment, I read it with yellow hi-liter in hand. I practically drained the thing dry, highlighting illuminating paragraph upon paragraph. Dr. Haidt is a positively engaging writer, you have a sense of who he is personally in addition to what he has to teach you. And I noticed one of the earlier reviewers complaining that some of the research Haidt cited is 30 years old. Well, so what? Some of the research is even more ancient than that, if you count his quoting Buddha, John Donne and Confucius. The Happiness Hypothesis is fresh, it's smart, it sparkles. And it's right up there on my bookshelf along with Diane Ackerman's fantastic books (The Alchemy of Mind is a similar gem). The category: ""Darn! Here's another book I wish I had written"

In the world of Training and Development, this book is thorough, well organized and insightful.  This book is written for a general audience and supplies a thorough overview of the subject.  Allen knows that corporate leaders want to know what impact corporate universities will have on the bottom line, and what value the corporate university adds to the organization. Creating this link between learning and results, requires managers to identify their problems and needs, analyze employee performance, determine performance drivers, and then create corporate university programs that can directly improve identified problems and meet specific needs.

It does tell you that you need to find your own meaning (guess I knew that) but the quotes are SO true and the pictures SO cute, I thoroughly enjoyed them and they give me the message that I am on the right path.

After getting sucked into one of the many TV specials talking about counting cards and beating Vegas I decided to look into the issue and this book, as I had heard, was the `one' to read. While reading the book I found that it was extremely hard to put down and that I essentially had goose bumps imagining the pure brilliance of these college kids."
books,4 of 5,5.0,--getting better and better,"Jasper Fforde is seriously bizarre and it shows in his incredibly creative premise for the Thursday Next series.  All of these books are very well written and can stand on their own (as complete novels), but if you read the books in sequence -- Thursday Next's story becomes better and better.  Each book answers questions that I did not even know to ask -- and the story becomes even more satisfying.  I refused to loan the books ""out of order"" to friend, because I felt that she would enjoy the entire series -- not just the one title that she asked to borrow.  I highly recommend the entire series -- and so far -- anything else Jasper Fforde has written."
books,5 of 6,5.0,Outstanding general history,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The book is exactly what it says it is, a general history of the United Stated during the Depression and WWII.  I found myself wanting to know more about many topics than author wrote.  This should be expected though as the nature of a book of this type though is that some topics must be treated in a rather cursory manner or left out all together.  The book does provide a vivid portrait of the era and of the events and personalities that shaped it.  After reading it, I can see why it won the Pulitzer prize"

books,47 of 56,5.0,The Morality of  Liberalism,"John Rawls is indisputably the most honorable spokesman of political liberalism of the past twenty-five years. His theoretical committment to and devlopment of liberalism is an inspiring attempt to reconcile the  difficulties inherent in a heterogenous society in which different  conceptions of the good life and varied value systems, beliefs, and  principles can coexist and yet affirm the political conception of a  constitutional regime. How can a nation entreat its inhabitants to carve  out their conception of the good life and their own value systems and yet  achieve agreement on a set of principles that all citizens may abide by? It  is the answer to this question that Rawls's works have sought to answer.  The Law of Peoples is no less concerned with this question. Rawls's  attempts to extend a social contractarian approach to human existence on  the international level is thorough and nuanced. Liberal peoples, he  argues, have three basic features. They possess a reasonably just  constitutional democractic government that serves their fundamental  interests; they are united by common sympathies; and above all, they have a  morally mature nature. Critics who claim that Rawls's brand of liberalism  invites a form of moral agnosticism had better think twice. Moral maturity  and its genetic antecedent--human moral nature, are the preconditions that  underly the moral basis of liberalism in general: deep respect for human  beings and the necessity of treating them as ends in themselves.  Rawls's  development of a Just War Doctrine should force us to re-think traditional  concepts of sovereignty and undermines the claims to legitimacy that outlaw  states seek to impose on moral communities in the name of cultural  authenticity. In this respect Rawls' work is indispensible to young liberal  scholar's such as myself. In fact I have depended on his theoretical  approach to ground much of my highly controversial and hotly contested  book, &quot;Becoming a Cosmopolitan: What It Means To be a Human Being in  the New Millennium.&quot; I argue, however, for a more pugnacious form of  liberalism by rejecting outright, as conceptions of the good, all forms of  tribal (racial/ethnic and national)identities and argue for the  obliteration of all cultural practices that undermine human rights. For  those who believe that moral progress is possible and who wish to further  advance the idea that liberal democracies represent a superior and more  evolved form of social and political living, The Law of Peoples is a  detailed and rigorous application of this idea"

books,10 of 11,5.0,One of the best...,if not the best computer-related book I've read. The author's unassuming and eloquent discourse makes reading the book a very interesting proposition. The manner in which the topics are covered are absolutely great and very intuitive. The books is absolutely well structured and well supported. It was surely a surprise to find a computer-programming book where the author was candid and unambiguous. As a programmer coming from Java I found this book to be quite helpful and straight forward. The chapter on pointers and references does a superb job at getting the reader to understand the concept and to be able to apply it. The appendices are also great with lots of handy information. This is one of the few computer books that I actually dare to recommend buying without any qualms

For no real reason either, he just seemed to fit that mold to an extremely naive liberal.  It certainly makes me uncomfortable to think back to those days, because I am now a pragmatic and realistic moderate and I certainly had Friedman pegged wrong (and also because I now realize Moore and Franken are mostly useless)."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Beowulf Retold,"This novel is actually one of Crichton's better creations. Crichton tries to write the events of the epic poem Beowulf in a believeable manner. And for a man who has made the eventual rise of dinosaurs believable to we skeptics (no tropical savanna locked in glacial ice necessary), he pulls this stunt off as well. He presents the information from the perspective of Ibn Fadlan, an emmissary from Babylon. With footnotes and such (and the fact that Ibn Fadlan was a real travel historian), the book is confusing until you realize that almost all of it is entirely made up."

A lot of people really enjoyed the character Drizzt from the Icewind Dale trilogies, and this three part epic compiles everything that ever happened to him before you first met him in the earlier book.  The characters beside Drizzt are amazing and dynamic, bringing their own unique touch to the story.  This book is suitable for anyone over the age of ten, yet isn't a kid's novel.  The world Salvatore creates in The Dark Elf Trilogies is fantastic, and quite immense also.  Ranging from the delving caverns of the Underdark to the over world, the setting plays a major role in the story, just like in other fantasy books, except more so in this one.  This book is loaded with detail, and the plot will be sure to keep the reader wondering what's going to happen next.  Some parts may seem a bit predictable, but they aren't as important as the major events.  Overall, this has got to be one of the best fantasy books I have ever read, and I personally enjoy it more than the Lord of the Rings and other epics.  I definitely recommend to anyone interested in the fantasy genre to read this book, otherwise you'll be missing out on a great opportunity"
books,,4.0,Fell short of my high expectations!!,"I say it fell short only because when I got this book I hoped it would delve further into Alice's life, and beyond that, into Diana's life. After reading TAGD, which is one of my all-time favorite novels, Ms. Koen hinted strongly at an interesting history for Alice and Diana, and I just knew that a prequel had to come at some point. YEARS later, it is here, and while I loved the book, I was dissapointed in that it only spanned a couple of years (if that)and then ended abruptly at the most interesting time (I won't divulge so that non-readers won't be spoiled). And not one hint of Diana - so I am wondering if there is such a thing as a ""second prequel""?? Ms. Koen simply MUST go further into Alice's life after this book ended and definitely introduce us to Diana when she was younger!! I want more!!"
books,,5.0,Bigger & Better Than The Last J.D. Robb Series Book & That Would Seem Not Possible,"It is simply unbearable to put this book down.  The character development is completely captivating; and the humor of Eve and Roarke regarding childbirth cannot but to keep the reader chuckling.  Great thriller and great story outside the thriller.  A masterpiece inside a masterpiece.  I will say no more as to do so would ruin the pleasure of reading ""Born In Death"". And that would be an unspeakable crime"
books,10 of 11,5.0,Excellent Place to Find Your New Favorite Novel,"First, a word about the term cult fiction, and its implications. When I first saw the title of this little book, I assumed it would be full of strung-out wreckages like Burroughs and Dick. While the Rough Guide does contain them (as it should), its scope is far greater than writers of that type. In here you'll find a wind range of novelists reviewed, including Graham Greene, John Fowles, even Zane Grey. Bottom line: an excellent resource for readers"
books,,1.0,The Insider's Guide to Making Money in Real Estate: Smart Steps to Building Your Wealth Through Property,"This Dolf de Roos book is no different from his other books, owning one is the same as owning all. Writes about same topics and ideas. Good author, trying to sell more books by using different titles."
books,1 of 1,5.0,When Bad Things Happen to Good People,Excellent!  I gave this book to my sister who lost her granddaughter to cancer and she said it provided the most help of all.  Thanks so much
books,2 of 2,5.0,"Love this series, and Branley's are among the best!","This book is a perfect introduction to volcanoes for K-2 level kids, and older kids or early readers may enjoy reading them alone.  It is easy to understand and the illustrations are clear and nice-looking.  Unlike some science books for kids, this series tends to be very readable, versus a drier text that may make some kids lose interest quickly"
books,2 of 4,4.0,A surprise read,From ABC's 20/20
books,4 of 5,5.0,Stunning!,"Can't remember when I have been so captivated by a novel.  The reviewers who complain that the main character hasn't much depth are right--but they don't really get that this is the whole point.  Kunzru is making a comment on the flexibility of identity.  Pran's initial identity is a lie (although he doesn't know it), subsequent identities are forced upon him by necessity and others' needs and expectations, and he eventually learns that he can manipulate his own identity to his advantage.  An absolutely stunning, yet playful, story that demonstrates the ways in which we perceive ourselves and others and how we shape personal and cultural values.  Outstanding--I can't recommend it highly enough and wish I could give it 10 stars"
books,,4.0,A much needed re-launch of Rapp,"Well, the previous 2 books were showing that Mitch was losing his motivation to be Dirty Harry/SuperAgent and they were mostly action and no further character building."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Fast-paced Thriller - Could Not Put It Down!,"I just finished reading this book and WOW!  It was great!  I really had trouble putting it down.  The plot was very convincing and I just loved the ending.  There was a surprise on every page including the last page. As a writer, the two things I was most impressed with (in addition to the wonderful plot) was how Case created such a sense of place - I really felt like I was there in every scene and I could really visualize the space.  I also thought he did such a good job of nailing the dialogue - each character sounded different, one could imagine someone speaking English as a second language, yet it was not difficult to read.  I thought the information about the relics in the Catholic church was especially interesting and also, all the technical cloning stuff made me realize that this entire plot is not so far-fetched.  It would make a great movie"
books,2 of 5,1.0,Bored me to tears....,"I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton"
books,8 of 8,4.0,Not much heat in this fire,"Great Falls, Montana, is surrounded by numerous forest fires. Joe's father (Joe is the boy narrator of the story) has lost his job as a golf pro and has gone off to fight the fires. While he's away, Joe's mother falls in love with another man. This is the most Hemingway-ish of Ford's books, and the writing is crisp and clear. But there is also a certain coldness and distance from emotions displayed in the prose that's hard to understand. Ford is one of my favorite writers on the contemporary scene, so I like just about everything he's written so far; this book is good but not as good as ""The Sportswriter"" or ""Independence Day."
books,3 of 4,5.0,The Best Veggie Cookbook for All Ages,I received this book when I first became a vegetarian as a young teenager. I loved it then for its easy to make recipes and easy to find ingredients. I love it now because the recipes actually taste better than my fancy veggie cookbooks. I recommend this book for vegetarians (and non-vegetarians!) of all ages.
books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Read,"I really liked this book, it was a great fast read.  The only thing was the main character was very emotional, a little more than I'm used to in a male character, he seemed to cried a lot.  Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it"
books,0 of 1,5.0,I couldn't sleep through the night!,"No kidding -- this book gave me insomnia!  I would wake up at the same time every morning, just like the character in the book:  it was awful.  I can't remember how long it took me to get a full night's sleep after reading this book.  Buy and read at your own peril"
books,6 of 11,1.0,My First Patterson Book--Probably My Last,"I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, ""Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good...""  Wrong-er words were never spoken."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Lovely,"Hope Mirrlees originally published this marvelous book back in the 1920s, to some acclaim at the time.  The book then was forgotten by all except a few lovers of fantasy until it was republished by the now legendary ""sign of the unicorn"" series put out by Ballentine in the 1960s and early 70s.  Many authors have tried, with varying degrees of success, to achieve what Mirrlees does so effortlessly:  She brings a true sense of the mystery and wonder to this story of a people who live on the borders of fairlyland.  In this book, we learn about Nathaniel Chanticleer and his son.  About a people who would rather not see fairyland, but who are in some ways inextricably linked.  I don't want to say too much, or give too much away about this wondrous story, but I would like to say that one phrase has stuck with me for a long time:  One character accidentally wears yellow to a funeral, and then comments that it was, ""after all, a blackish sort of yellow.""  True words of the genuine synesthete, yes; but also true words of those who have touched the fe.  I am just delighted that this is back in print.  I hope everyone reads and enjoys it!"
books,1 of 2,1.0,This book is now serving as my doorstop.,"If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep"
books,3 of 13,2.0,Melodramatic,"McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Informative and Straight to the Point,"I am very pleased with this book.  Although I have other books that touch upon some of the same topics, The Expert's Guide to the Baby Years contains short chapters that get straight to the point.  Each section is written by an expert in that specific field, so you know that you are getting the best information out there. I highly recommend this book!"
books,,4.0,"Good, as usual.","Very good in the sequel line, but I figured out ""who dun it"" before I finished.  The characters are still developing well, waiting for the next one.  I have the whole series."
books,3 of 4,5.0,"If I could get everyone to read just one book, this is it!",This is probably the most important book to get Christians to read.  More important than the Bible? Yes -- because reading this will 1) get people excited about getting into the Bible and 2) give them the tools to get the most out of their time in the Bible.
books,13 of 13,4.0,A huge business hit of the early 90s that has aged pretty well,"This is one of the business classics in the past twenty years.  It has sold a huge number of copies and I am sure many of those purchased copies were actually read!  As impressive as its sales numbers have been, the way it has affected the approach to the way business was discussed and talked about for the past dozen years has been even more impressive."
books,6 of 74,1.0,No good,"I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16"

books,3 of 3,4.0,I liked it but didn't love it....,I did like this story - the amnesia angle was written perfectly.  I enjoyed how the story played out very much.  I was learning things at the same time as Riley and found it to be very interesting.  I thought that was fun and refreshing and Hooper did a fantastic job with that aspect.
books,3 of 4,5.0,Exceptional and Educational,"Over the years I have read many books on the Red Scare in Hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism.  This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films.  In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists.  In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party.  This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist.  And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings."
books,9 of 9,5.0,This was a very powerful book for me.,A friend loaned me the Tracker and The Search a few months ago and I was impressed with the straight forward truths in the writing and the experiences that the author shared.  I next chose Grandfather and was not  disappointed.  Each chapter struck me deeply and contained powerful  &quot;connection with earth and all things&quot; truths that will be with  me for a long time.  I highly recommend each of these three books and I  look forward to reading more from this author
books,11 of 15,5.0,"Tell the rabble, my name is Cabell.","Any guy, especially one over forty, who doesn't adore this book, and doesn't have at least a dozen Cabell books on his shelf, including at least one signed first edition, is a savage. If you don't understand the heart rending chapter, ""Dorothy Who Did Not Understand"", you haven't lived"
books,2 of 2,5.0,"Could not have been any better-a mystery, romance, and history all in one!","This book was the best I have read of Picoult, though I don't think she knows how to write a bad one! It explores the Amish community and the story takes place in that setting."
books,19 of 23,5.0,The Best Book of History You Will Ever Read,"I'm trying to read all of Mr. Johnson's books, because this one was so good. Some are not available. MODERN TIMES is a sweeping history of the 20th century that should be read by students everywhere. Armed with the facts, they'd be less prone to falling for historical lunacy later on."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Great Book!,"The ""Honest Truth"" (or, more accurately, Reactionary Bias) does not sound as much against homosexuality as he does unsafe sexual behavior, which many, many gay men do not engage in. Heterosexuals do a lot of stupid stuff too, but we do not blame heterosexuality, we blame the self-destructive behavior. What HT fails to explain in his review is this: How do you account for all the gay men out there (myself included, HELLO) who are not promiscuous and risk-taking in their personal lives? I'd like to here the ""honest truth"" about that! Oh, and by the way, what makes straight people always think they're such authorities on gays and lesbians? If you want to find a real expert, look no further than an actual gay person. What a concept"
books,1 of 12,1.0,Stephen King Was My Teen Years,"I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in."
books,1 of 1,1.0,Hard to Take,I tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't read anymore after the second decision. It's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it. It's the same old self-help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse. I feel cheated that I paid $1.29 for it at the thrift store.
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Wonderful development of characters, traditions, and societal values","My mother is Japanese and moved to the U.S. fifty or more years ago. She read this book and savored it, rereading passages over and over.  She delighted in recalling the symbolism and rituals of long forgotten traditions that were explained in this book.  After hearing her delight in the story and its characters, I could not wait to read it. She gave the book to me with the promise that I would return it so she could continue to re-read it.  It was a quick and captivating read for me. My only disappointment was reaching the end of the novel and wanting more."
books,20 of 115,1.0,More Dr. Laura Diatribe....,"Self proclamation does not a doctor make.  Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years.  She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her.  Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public.  Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent"
books,2 of 4,5.0,Local boys voyage to the Moon,"I first read this book many years ago, and I still reflect on it from time to time.  It changed the way I looked at the world.  Simple in content, and perhaps a story out-moded for the present adventures found in SF, it still  has a particular value to the reader that will make it a favorite.  This  book was about unbridled ambition.  A handful of young rocket enthusiasts  and a instructor build a rocket ship and go to the moon utilizing their own  wits and resources.  Heinlein taps into the possibilities that could shape  the future, and essentially poses the question 'How long will space  exploration remain only a government exercise? Why couldn't private  citizens take it upon themselves to explore the stars themselves?'  This  entire book may seem simple at first glance, but I consider it an important  and thought provoking concept for any dreamer with a vision. At the time  this was written, it was very much ahead of it's time"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Funniest Man Alive,"David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud & embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along.

books,23 of 26,5.0,Letting go of what we &quot;know&quot;,"Mulholland's insistance that we are capable of letting go of what we know in order to freshly approace the scriptures with the intent of allowing ourselves to be shaped by God's Word is the premise of this excellent book.   I lend it to friends, but make certain I retrieve it.  The author  describes the path he has personally trod in his attempt to realize his  full God given potential.  Examples illustrate his struggle to distinguish  the critical difference between the accustomed reading of scripture for  information, and the life changing willingness to read for personal  spiritual formation.  I am grateful for having discovered this fine author,  and recommend this book to anyone interested in signposts to guide their  spiritual journey"

books,8 of 9,4.0,A glowing perspective,"In this discerning and somewhat humorous essay, Virginia Woolf remarks on humanity's experiences with illness, whether mental or physical, and on how it is rarely the subject of literature or art. She notes our contradictory nature toward sympathy and offers an opinion about what illness tells us about the natural world. Hermione Lee's fascinating introduction firmly places this remarkable work in the context of Woolf's life and writing. This Paris Press edition recreates the original artwork and typeset of the 1930 printing of ""On Being Ill"""
books,101 of 109,4.0,Insightful and complete,"I bought this book on the strength of Marjorie Garber's excellent past Renaissance scholarship. I was expecting something more theoretically informed and original, but as it is this is a very worthwhile book, and I predict it will be an essential reference book for teachers and students. It's a BIG book with a substantial chapter on each play (but not the sonnets), as with Harold Bloom's book on Shakespeare. Garber, however, is less idiosyncratic than Bloom; She synthesizes the best of recent scholarship, but without footnotes or extensive theorizing a la Derrida and Lacan. Garber combines close attention to language with valuable historical background and context. For example, in her chapter on Macbeth, she relates a ""new critical"" analysis of the clothing imagery to  sumptuary laws regarding clothing (laws which served to enforce the social hierachy of Renaissance England). The strengths of this book are her comprehensive discussions of the play, which sum up what we know for sure about the plays including the relevant historical contexts, and her brilliant analysis of Shakespeare's language, i.e., close reading. While her work is illuminated by recent scholarship, she avoids the Stalinesque imperatives of political correctness. Compare Garber's intelligent discussion of the problem of gender in Macbeth with Stephen Orgel's ""introduction"" in The Complete Pelican Shakespeare, in which he reductively reads the play as a ""misogynist fantasy."" The only reason I docked the book one star is that, based on the chapters I've read so far, she doesn't really make a  major original contribution to Shakespeare studies (in contrast to, for example, Greenblatt's recent bio of Shakespeare, Will in the World) so much as synthesize what we already know. All in all, a very valuable reference book that I will be consulting regularly in my college teaching. Highly recommended for high school teachers, English majors (undergraduate and graduate), and all fans of Shakespeare"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Book Review,"If you are into Super-Heroes and those specifically related to DC, this is a must have book.  The quality of the illustrations is worth every penny."
books,1 of 2,4.0,An enjoyable read.,This was an interesting book.  It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read.  The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era.  I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time.  I plan on reading several other works by this author.  It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language.  I would recommend

books,,5.0,Outstanding pychology book for anyone to read!,"Outstanding!  Easy to read and full of valuable information on how your pet (or other animal) actually thinks and sees the world around it.  It is also full of valuable, real-world examples of how to handle this and also full of valuable insight into people and how we think.  Temple Grandin, the author, is autistic (although relatively high-level functioning) and she sees the world differently than you and I see it.  She also believes that is how animals see the world.  I don't agree with the extremes she believes, but I think she is on to something and there is a lot to be learned from her.  She certainly has plenty of examples of instances where her point of view produced the results the animal handlers were looking for in any case."

books,9 of 9,5.0,"Enlightening, Interesting and Accessible to All","I agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts.  The book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics, society, religion, politics and of course physics have affected each other  (it goes both ways!) through out the ages.  Furthermore, the author nicely  illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes  have also changed through the ages (i.e., The Age of Reason versus The  Renisance).  This book left me with real insights as to the nature and  limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics.  Things are  not as they seem, my friend!  Lastly, the author displays an appreciation  for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put  down at times.  I never thought a math/history book could be a &quot;page  turner&quot;... Read it"
books,3 of 3,5.0,"Witt, adventurous and engaging","This unique book tells the story of a bunch of intrepid and inspired men who pioneered the exploration of the last great unknown: the deeps of the sea.  How would you fancy wading out under water with nothing more than an inverted coal bucket over your head?  Would you agree to a fight a shark, equipped with nothing more than a knife, all so that some movie company could film the gory encounter?  Inventive, adventurous, foolhardy to the point of recklessness, many of the diving pioneers were also world-famous in their own right, like the great biologist JBS Haldane, who worked out how to survive at dangerous depths.  Others evolved from treasure seekers to become the first underwater archaeologists, exploring ancient shipwrecks in exotic waters, or, most interesting of all, opening our eyes to the beauty of marine habits and wildlife, including the seriously threatened coral reefs.  The author, himself a marine biologist and diver, blends all this into a magical weave of fact and wonder enlivened by a mordant wit and a delightful eye for quirky detail.  I would recommend it to any reader"

The truth is, the U.S. provides the best life in terms of wealth and freedom, and they just can't get that back home. The book is by a man who moved here, and explains, from the outside in, why the U.S. is so great."

Mostly, I listen to these books to stay awake so I'm always looking for something fast and exciting that I don't have to think hard to comprehend at 5:30 am.  This book was the perfect fit.  The characters are developed, but not too deeply where it's confusing who is who, etc..  Unlike other thrillers that I've read, you really begin rooting for the main character because of the opening scene.  Big F is a great character too that always keeps you guessing."
books,113 of 125,5.0,Perfect gift for adults and families,"Lynne Cheney reveals her love for America's history and her commitment to scholarship in A Time for Freedom.  A chronology of America's past from the arrival of the first Americans to the present day, this book presents the events that shaped our country in a way that is understandable and compelling.  Cheney's organization of the book-it passes through history in date order, with short summaries of events instead of complicated explanations-gives the reader a sense of context that is rare in history literature, yet essential for understanding our national story.  I learned that in 1968 alone, North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive; assassins murdered Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy; police used tear gas against antiwar activists at the Chicago Democratic convention; and women protested the Miss America Pageant, in that order.  Understanding this national suffering is surely necessary if we are to appreciate the hope that Neil Armstrong inspired across the country when, in early 1969, he became first person to walk on the moon!"
books,4 of 9,5.0,A Vision of a Fundamentalist's Dream,"If anyone wants to know what living in post-revolution Iran is like for a woman, this is the book.  Great detail is given to how the messages of western literature apply to life in the theocratic totalitarian state. The scariest thing, for me, is how closely the vision of Iran held by muslim extremists conforms to the stated vision of the U.S. held by christian extremists.  This touched me with reality the way The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood touched me with fictional possibility."

books,2 of 2,5.0,The core of Keynesian theory,"The General Theory is the main work of Keynes and his theory, which is was written to distinguish himself from the classical theory. The style is fairly hard to read, as the language is not easy and the contents obviously very advanced. Nevertheless, reading this book is worth the efforts, as the theory (so often very badly taught at schools and universities) becomes crystal clear. At the same time, it is a book that should ideally be read by someone who has at least got some basics in Economics, as otherwise the book may seem too hard."

books,3 of 3,4.0,Not Just An Actor,"Brando was also a terrific storyteller. This book puts to rest so many rumors and gives an honest self-appraisal of this large and largely misunderstood genius. His life was filled with deepest tragedy, but Brando managed to stay positive and he kept his killer sense of humor. The book is funny! Brando was an actor, but also a humanitarian and a true friend to those without a voice. I encourage fans to hear his story from his own voice, rather than one of the many gossip-filled bios available"
books,8 of 9,5.0,Thoughtful!,"This novel was written with intelligence, insight and focus which demands the same from its reader.  Shirley Hazzard assumes the reader is well read on matters regarding literature, poetry and international politics which is refreshing in fiction.  This is not a light read.  The language is dense, erudite,  often the sentences do not breathe, but the story is engrossing and rewarding - suspenseful, until the last chapters when all is revealed"

books,6 of 7,4.0,An Enlightening Read,"I finished this book very quickly and found it to be both very illuminating on the Muslim-immigrant experience and the foibles of the native-born Europeans who, raised on socialism and convinced of their sophistication, have lost the ability to comprehend much less deal with a violent ideology that wants to destroy their 'utopia'."
books,2 of 3,5.0,I've read this book 3 times!,"I'm not a baseball fan.  Hockey is the game of my heart.  Baseball?  No way.  But, I loved this book.  The only other baseball book that I've ever read that comes close to this high-water mark is Ball Four by Jim Bouton.  Funny and interesting in its own right.  A real joy to read."
books,1 of 2,5.0,A Terrific Book,"In a field littered with shoddily written confessional memoirs, Mommies Who Drink stands out as an excellent book across the boards.  It goes without saying that it's funny and topical, but there's more to it than that.  I finished the book in one sitting.  A couple days later I picked it up and started again, paying close attention to the writing.  In addition to her deadpan hilarity and keen eye, Paesel brings tremedous skill to the page.  There's an economy of language and precision in the composition that strengthens the humor and pace, but also rivets the reader's attention when she moves seamlessly from comic narrative to poignant observation.  In fact, the realizations offered flow organically from the comedy; the one depends on the other.  I was thankful to discover that the book is completely free of cynicism and hipster attitude.  It is, instead, an open and big hearted book that is filled with sentiment, but not at all sentimental.  This funny, tender, expertly written memoir stands up to, and invites, repeat readings.  A sure sign of quality writing."
books,2 of 2,4.0,"Interesting story, but slow moving","Justin Quayle is a diplomat with the British High Commission in Nairobi.  A mild man who loves gardening, Quayle is devastated when he hears that his beloved, much younger wife Tessa has been brutally murdered while attending a conference with her companion, African Dr. Arnold Bluhm.  Rumors are rampant and deal with everything from the relationship between Tessa and Bluhm to the the reason for her murder.  Justin emerges from the paralysis of mourning and decides that his goal is to throw himself into the task of tracking Tessa's quest for human rights in Nairobi and thus finding out the motive for murder.  As he tries to duplicate Tessa's movements during her final days, Justin discovers that her efforts had been directed at a large drug company which is unethically testing drugs on poor Africans who have contracted tuberculosis.  Le Carre takes the reader through a seemingly unending series of interviews and manipulations between Justin, the pharmaceutical company and the diplomatic corps.  The same effect could have been achieved in many fewer pages, but the story remains a haunting and interesting one"
books,2 of 2,4.0,Another charming collection of stories,"The unlikely adventures of Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld continue in this collection of five stories by Alexander McCall Smith. The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs finds our hero--the renowned author of that philological masterwork Portuguese Irregular Verbs--lecturing on the subject of veterinary medicine at the University of Arkansas (""The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs""), evading man-hungry widows on board a cruise ship (""The Perfect Imperfect""), and hobnobbing with Vatican bigwigs while vacationing in Italy (""The Bones of Father Christmas""). His relationship with his nemesis, Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer (the author of a study on the Portuguese imperfect subjunctive, which is not, however, as fine a piece of scholarship as Igelfeld's own monograph), deepens in the course of these stories, despite Igelfeld's unwonted involvement with sausage dogs and as a direct result of the aforementioned widows."

books,23 of 26,2.0,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!,"There are many great ideas presented in this book about dealing with your add child, BUT the chapter on meds is completely off base.  Let me preface the following with MY opinion (I am not an MD or an expert) that children with ADD need a team approach in helping them deal with the condition (if you choose to call it one) and there is a place for meds for many kids, BUT it is only a piece of the puzzle. Parents, teachers, family members, Md's, and behavioral specialists are all crucial. I happen to work indirectly with many of the world thought leaders and experts on ADD (ie. Joseph Beiderman, Mass General Hospital, Boston MA/ Harvard Medical School, ... look up his credentials). First Dr. Frank Lawlis is not an MD, this means he has not been to medical school- that is not to say he isn't a great psychologist, just that he HAS NOT and DOES NOT write prescriptions for these meds and has NO first hand experience with directly managing these meds himself.  In this book there are many things that are completely false regarding ADD meds. For example he states that they only work for about 50% of kids.  FALSE Let me cite 3 credible sources that disputes this (notice in the book that he does not talk about HIS credible source)"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Bizarre. Weird.  Triumphant.,How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.
books,,1.0,"""What to Expect"" way off the mark","I read this book after reading ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and was very disappointed.  I liked ""Expecting,"" most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading ""First year"" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of ""some babies will, some babies won't.""  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Shooting stars and melted hearts,"Neil Gaiman's ""Stardust"" takes place in a mystical version of England.  The town of Wall is a tiny, safe and quiet village that is a bastion of safety from the outside world.  Residents of the aptly-named Wall never venture outside of the village barriers and nobody from outside is allowed in, so as to keep Wall safe.  Villagers, in pairs, are assigned shift duties in protecting the Gap that separates Wall from the outside world."
books,2 of 2,5.0,A must have book,"I first read this to my son when he was one and a half months old.  He smiled and (almost) laughed, he liked it so much.  Amazing that a book can do that to a child at that age.  He still loves it, and you'll be amazed how quickly you learn to recite it by memory.  It comes in handy all the time -- waiting in the doctor's office, riding in the car, anytime he starts to fuss.  And it doesn't matter if I don't even have the book around -- I just say it and the words capture his attention.  Excellent"

books,10 of 11,5.0,A Rare Collection of Novellas That Mostly Hit the Mark,"As the editor of this compilation (Ed McBain, aka Evan Hunter) says, novellas are rather unusual these days, although in the old pulp fiction days they were fairly thick on the ground. A novella is, as defined in the publishing world, a story that is longer than a short story (which usually runs up to 5,000 words) and shorter than a novel (usually more than 60,000 words), somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 to 40,000 words. And apparently a novella (sometimes called a novelette) is hard to write because it tends either to compress to a short story or expand to a novel. Yet, the ten writers here, none of the neophytes, met their charge from McBain to come up with a genuine novella with aplomb (except perhaps for Stephen King, whose novella really reads like a short story - but then he's a big enough name that it's no surprise that his story made the book without any criticism). As in any collection there are some hits and some misses, but in fact I was engaged by every single entry. Some, though, were a cut above the rest -- Walter Mosley's 'Archibald  Lawless, Anarchist at Large: Walking the Line' and Lawrence Block's 'Keller's Adjustment.' (I will admit that I tend to read everything these two writers produce and they are particular favorites of mine. Mosley, in fact, I consider to be one of our best writers, regardless of genre.)"
books,,2.0,Not one of Quindlen's best,"This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young ""sew-your-wild-oats"" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the ""perfect"" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years"
books,1 of 4,5.0,Can't wait for her next book...,"Music plays a major role in this book - the main character is a highly sought-after singer - and I like the way Isaak handles the music. Rather than try to write a collection of songs, I've never seen this done successfully (Writing stories does not make you a song writer), she focuses on the songs story and the emotion it triggers in the singer and his audience.  It's as if the music is a living object - excellent.  I found this book riveting, with lyrical prose, compelling characters, and a story that made it hard to put down.  I can't wait for her next book"

I felt this book covered everything that I wanted to know and even discussed what to do when writing a will and how it changes with a Down Syndrome child.  Things I never would have thought would be different until reading this book.  It took about 4 months before I was willing to read something about this because I wanted to start raising him just like I raised my other children.  This was definitly a book that did not go the extreme in the condition which is something I wanted.  I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who has a child with Down Syndrome"

books,1 of 1,5.0,A Great Escape from Today's World,"I just found out about this book as an adult, read it and loved it.  I wish I had heard about it as a preteen or teenager -- it was exactly the type of book I read as a child.  While it does have magical elements, it is not full of ""Harry Potter"" magic if people are lead here by JK Rowling's comments.  It is more fanciful and mysterious, with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in -- a perfect escape from the real world for a bit.  It sounds like a movie is being made, which intrigues me.  I can't wait to see how it translates to the big screen.  Altogether, it was an absolutely lovely book, one I am going to recommend to others to read -- 'tween, teen, or adult"

I recommend this book to everyone who loves to read good writing"
books,,5.0,Before he became a grumpy old man,"Before he became a curmudgeonly hermit on the level of a B. Traven or a Thomas Pynchon, Salinger was a close and sympathetic observer of youth and life amongst the New York upper-middle classes.  The short stories he wrote from the early 40s through the late 50s placed him among the ranks of the best practitioners of the art.  In all, Salinger wrote approximately two dozen short stories, most of which appeared within the pages of ""The NewYorker,"" along with those of his contemporary John Cheever, who was exploring the same territory but with a different emphasis.  Salinger specialized in quirky, high-quality tales spiced with equal amounts humor, philosophy, yearning, and sadness, and the far-too-few stories in this volume are a good representative of his work.  The emotional trauma of WWII - something which affected him personally and perhaps contributed to the man he is now - is depicted in differing ways in such stories as ""Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut"", ""For Esme - With Love and Squalor,"" and ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish.""  ""Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes"" is written almost entirely as dialogue, ""The Laughing Man"" takes as its theme the magic of story-telling, while ""Down at the Dinghy"" and ""Teddy"" illustrate Salinger's famous empathy with children.  It's a pity and a mystery that Salinger only included nine of his many wonderful stories in this volume.  Apparently, to this day he refuses to allow any of his stories to be reprinted in anthologies, and has withdrawn permission to keep his stories in new editions of such older anthologies as ""Short Story Masterpieces"" or ""Fifty Great Short Stories.""  It's as if Salinger the artist for the last forty years has practiced a type of Zen self-abnegation, erasing not just his present but his past.  Why write if you don't want to be read?  What purpose, other than self-therapy, does art serve without an audience?  (But don't despair.  If you surf the samizdat of the net carefully, you'll find other stories by Salinger.)"

books,,4.0,Great book,"This book is a short read.  The pace and prose is circa 1959, but it fits this story very well.  It is the quintessential haunted house book and offers plenty of creepy moments, always subtle and handled with care, more psychodynamic than cheap surprises or thrills.  If you're looking for blood and guts or chase scenes this is not the book.  It ended a bit abruptly and I was not satisfied with the ending for Eleanor, felt a little cheated in the end.  Great book"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Very well crafted,"My first Deaver -- I want more.  Also my first book review.  The book was really fun to read but I agree with some of the other reviewers here who said the plot twists strained credulity.  Still, I love the way Deaver paints people so vividly, and scenes, and the conversations made me laugh.  He's a master at this.   Katherine Dance for instance -- she was the cop from California who helped interview the suspects.  Now my question is:  Is there really such an interview technique as the one she uses throughout the book?   I did a few searches, nothing came up so far.  Very interesting.  Anyway, that's my review.  I recommend the book basically, despite the mazelike plot.  I've found a new favorite author."

books,9 of 12,5.0,An enjoyable journey across the continent,"What happened in the past is the past and what we say about it is history, James W. Loewen says as he opens Lies Across America (21). In the course of 95 vignettes Loewen demonstrates that much of the time history, as it is presented to the public through historic sites across the country, takes the form of non-controversial hogwash. Loewen points out that historic site visitors should realize that each location tells two stories: the story of the event or person it is commemorating and the story of its erection or preservation. The former is the truth and the latter is what those who erected or preserved the monument want the general public to think is the truth. Loewen argues many erectors suffer from the ""heritage syndrome,"" the impulse to only remember what is attractive or flattering and ignore all the rest (47)."

She would spend the entire night throwing herself against the sides, hitting the door with her paw, and scratching the plastic tray that was the bottom piece in an attempt to dig her way out.  About this time my wife very wisely left for Sweden for several weeks, and after ten days without sleep I capitulated and let the dog stay out of the cage at night."
books,1 of 1,4.0,More tightly written,In this novel we have the characters we have come to love. The writing is tighter and the plot clear. Not quite as exciting or fresh. Some further development with Leah happens which I won't reveal
books,4 of 7,4.0,It took 8 years to make this?,"It took eight years to make Up Close and Personal, a movie about a television reporter and her mentor, starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. This book, by one of the screenplay writers, is a must for anyone who wants an example of just how absurd movie making can be. From the original story of Jessica Savitch, an ambitious and ultimately self-destructive young woman, Dunne's screenplay transforms over many years and many rewrites into a story that would get Disney's stamp of approval, which translates into ""a feel good movie with an uplifting storyline"". Often hilarious and at times moving, Monster gives you a real feeling for the time, skill, and patience it takes to create a screenplay. Just remember this is not an instructional guide to screenplay writing, see it rather as a cautionary tale. After reading this, you may wonder how movies get made at all"
books,1 of 1,5.0,DON'T READ THIS ALONE.....!!!!,"Angela Toussaint has nothing but warm, wonderful memories of her grandmother Marie, and summers at the Good House.  And while her Haitian grandmother evokes only thoughts of goodness in Angela, the fact is that her grandmother was a very powerful voodoo priestess who was widely known for her powers.  Angela is also blissfully unaware that many years prior her grandmother, driven to do so by anger, pride and a need for vengeance, summoned a spirit that would only mean death and destruction for her descendants.  Being the powerful priestess that she was, she was able to put the demon to sleep....where it has lay dormant within the earth of the Good House all of these years.  Returning to the small town of Sacajawea, Washington with her son Cory as she has done many times before, a simple task of cleaning the attic has sparked young Corey's curiosity in his grandmother; and before you know it, he is pouring through her book of spells and trying some of her magic.  Magic that eventually unleashes the fury of a being that has been dormant for almost a century, bringing with it death and destruction to all of the Toussaints......"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Please read this book before you have kids and after you've gone to the bathroom.,"If you already have kids, this book will seem funny, but mean spirited to all the good intentioned parents from a bygone era. If you haven't already gone to the bathroom, you will have an accident from laughing so hard. It starts funny and stays funny. There are really long reprinted articles that make you want to skip ahead to the funny parts, but read through everything for a unique insight into the world where you have to be 18 to smoke, 21 to drink, pass a test to recieve a license to drive, and obtain permission from the neighborhood association before you can build a deck on your own property. Yet anyone can spit a babe into the harsh, cruel world with only the advice of family members and current child rearing philosophies from our so-called experts"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Evil inevitably appears,"The year is 1943. War is raging across Eastern Europe and Northern Africa. Italy joins the battle, and so does Japan. Peace seems improbable. War is war, and its savage and horrific reality leaves tons of thousands of sodiers and civilians either dead or maimed for life."
books,3 of 3,5.0,A historical and biographical account of social entrepreneurial heros and heroines,"I found it inspiring and at the same time intimidating to contemplate the brilliant, hardworking people who inhabit this book.  All of them committed their lives, talents, and fortunes to tackle seemingly endemic and chronic social problems, starting small and eventually spreading their good works throughout their nations and even globally.  I recommend the book for anyone trying to improve their communities' health and welfare"
books,6 of 9,4.0,Professor Kennedy,"&quot;Freedom From fear&quot; by David Kennedy is a highly respectable history book for the Great Depression and WWII era. Professor Kennedy filled this book with lots of quality research, as well as his own opinions on the Great Depression. In the beginning of this book, Kennedy begins with Herbert Hoover and how he did things &quot;wrong&quot;, but then he turned to FDR who kept up with the changing economy at that time. Kennedy portrays FDR as powerful and willing for change. He was an inspiring character for those during the Depression. Further into the book, Kennedy devotes his research to the New Deal and the effects it had on the Depression. Kennedy did go into detail about the effects, but he should have researched more about the causes of the Depression. Even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was Kennedy's writing style that made the book hard to put down. It was very enjoyable to read and we recommend it to any history lovers who want to learn more about the Depression"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Loved it...,"I loved this book.  The pacing was perfect, the characters well-drawn, and the writing style engaging.  Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer of the title, and protagonist, is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his Lincolns.  He gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker.  The author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read.  This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, but based on this one, I'm going back to read his others"
books,8 of 10,4.0,You Can't Help But Love Him,"To be honest, I still haven't finished this book.  I keep it next to my bed for when I feel most alone.  Try to keep the amounts I do read to a bare minimum because I never want it to end. This collection of letters  captures so many sides of Buk: his business side, his harsh side; but also  a great deal of his sensitive, sad, depressive-but-loving side, that is  refreshing to see in any man, let alone one with such a weathered face. I  just can't help but Love him"
books,0 of 1,4.0,"Great book, a little sad","Generally, I love the ""in death"" series, because of Eve and Roarke. I liked this book, but I thought it was so sad when Eve was suspended from duty and had to turn her weapon and badge. But she did not give up. She is a strong woman and I love strong women, because they show real women that they can be just as strong, yet vulnerable"
books,11 of 12,4.0,"Reviewing Luigi Barzini's ""The Italians""","I heard of this book 40 years ago when a TV version won an Emmy award. I was inspired to read it after my most recent trip to Italy. Growing up as an Italian-American, I wondered why my people acted the way they do, and this book provides valuable insight. Barzini graduated from Columbia U., and it shows in his command of the English language. This book is a classic, but like most classics, it's old, so while much of it is timeless, other parts are out of date, both culturally and politically. However, if one wants to gain a grounding in the Italian culture, this book is a very good place to start"
books,,5.0,Bridget Jones's Diary,"I bought this book eventhough I own the dvd because the movie was fantastic and absolutly hilarious. Bridget Jones's Diary (the book) is equally as funny, it differs slightly from the movie but not too much, this works well because it adds new scenes and information into the story and life of Bridget Jones. It's a very well written, quick read that will remain on my bookshelf for a very long time. I recommend it to all"
books,6 of 7,5.0,Lyrically composed with a satisfying plotline,"Shirley Hazzard must have considered every word in every sentence; each possible meaning for every one.  Some of the lines are absolute gems with a myriad of meanings depending on how you focus on possible significances.  She writes with such beauty it takes your breath away.  So much is unsaid yet understood.   Finally, you need a good plot to have a good book, and this one is a satisfying in every way.  The characters grow and change then fulfill the roles they have adopted for themselves in a believable manner.  Gorgeous book"
books,1 of 1,2.0,Mediocre,"I agree, the book has many, many good insights and most of it makes sense. You can theoretically use his techniques, but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real-life situations. Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee. It seriously lacks depth but it's a decent read...but you will forget everything you read in 2 days."
books,7 of 7,4.0,"Very good, but a bit dated...","This is a wonderful book for starting in photography. It's only problem is that, even in its latest edition, it treats digital as a new technology that has yet to enter mainstream. It just dates itself in several ways, such as saying that APS is also a new technology. Really the techniques it gives are wonderfull no matter what, its just the equipment guide to 'Choosing a camera"" that needs to be updated"
books,3 of 4,5.0,AWESOME DEBUT!!,"A friend referred me to this new author, and I truly owe her one. Lani Diane Rich made me laugh and cry, and also kept me entertained for the entire story. At a time in my life when reading something ""grown-up"" is a luxury at best, this book provided a wonderful escape. I can't wait to get the next two books, and hope she continues writing for all of us that are now hooked on her characters. Thanks for a great read"
books,3 of 4,4.0,Getting There,"I had been a bit disappointed by the last couple of Tony Hillerman's books. This one was much more like the 'old' Hillerman. I am enchanted by how Hillerman moves Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn along the road of life, gives interesting insight into Navajo and Hopi culture, and still presents good solid mysteries. Hillerman is an outstanding writer with a relaxed and easy style. Like all of the earlier Chee/Leaphorn novels this one leaves you a bit breathless and with a smile on your face. Really good stuff."
books,,4.0,Read It in 2 Days,"If you're interested in forensics, chances are you'll like this book.  The book also manages to tie in sexual abuse, repressed memories, Miss., Vietnam, PTSD, and a little romance.  It even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long.  I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book's plot and discussions as intricate as they are"
books,2 of 13,2.0,Class Assignment,"I had to read this book for my college course. Most of the people in the class did not like it or agree with many of nakkan's viewpoints. I personally think he is repeating NA to us in his own words. if you are not into NA, yo will not like this book."
books,,4.0,Good Intro To Crichton,"This was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day.  This was also my first Crichton, and I have to say I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Easy to read adventure novel"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Captain Nemo & The Nautilus,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like ""Vexed"" ""Zoophytes"" and ""Connoisseur."" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant ""Narwhal"" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure."

books,10 of 11,5.0,An intriguing installment to the Wind River series,"It is hard to believe that Margaret Coel began her Wind River Reservation series some ten years ago with THE EAGLE CATCHER, which introduced readers to Father John O'Malley and defense attorney Vicky Holden. Each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between O'Malley and Holden. The latest installment in this series is no exception."
books,1 of 1,4.0,1776,"I read 1776 shortly sfter having read McCullough's John Adams so some of the same ground was covered but from a different perspective, I found 1776 to be an interesting and smoothly flowing read. Anyone who has enjoyed and appreciated David McCullough's other works will enjoy 1776"
books,4 of 4,5.0,"If you get one, keep it.","This is a fantastic translation of the Dao De Jing. (I have others.)  Perhaps I'm biased because it was the first one that I ever owned.  And as a beginner in Chinese who knows, but I find the expression of concepts very sound, very simple and in complete agreement with esoteric law as I understand it.  I have used it well over the years and soon will buy my very next copy.  I'm so glad that it's still in print as I keep lending it to people who seem to want it more than me"

books,0 of 2,5.0,In The Storm,Suzanne Brockmann Never disappoints.  Her story lines are always original and her romance always steamy.   Brockmann has built a family of characters her readers have learned to care about. It just keeps bringing me back again and again to find out whose book will be next.
books,13 of 13,5.0,Absolute necessity,This book should be read by anyone the least bit interested in breeding better dogs. Not light reading but extremely valuable to the serious breeder. The Author gives a basic course on genetics and backs up her facts. She applies these principles easily to dogs and makes it easy to understand. The photos and graphs are very helpful.The section on color inheritance is fascinating!If you are not interested in improving your breed do not bother but if you dedicated to your breed this book is invaluable
books,6 of 6,4.0,From another author,"Let me start by saying that I'm a dedicated fan of this genre. That means of course that I've read Lustbader, Trevanian, Eisler, and now both of Donohue's books. This particular book came by recommendation of my father, also a huge martial arts fan (and fellow practictioner). I can totally respect Donohue's effort, because I know first hand how hard it is to put together a compelling martial arts thriller. I recently published a martial arts novel. My book features a Judo/Kenpo master hunting a world-class sniper whose killing presidential candidates. It's more of a mainstream thriller inspired by Lustabader's early erotic martial arts violence. See ""Process of Elimination"" if interested. End of shamelesss plug!"
books,12 of 18,5.0,The prescription to defeat the terrorists...,"This book by the noted Conservative author Michael Ledeen gives the reader a good introduction to what this nation must do to eventually defeat the purveyors of Islamic extremism and terrorism.  Additionally, the book states the reasons that we are now dealing with the terror menace and how current and prior Administrations have failed in their efforts to fight the building evil.  If you are interested in what will have to be done to defeat terrorism, even though it certainly is not politically correct, pick up a copy of this book.  Highly recommended"
books,,5.0,My First Far Side Collection,"Some of my earliest memories are filled with reading The Far Side on my father's lap after the evening meal.  Whenever I asked my parents for a one of the standard collections, they told me to wait, one day they would all be in one book.  Then, for Christmas one year, I got this book."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Explains what it takes to make free market really work everywhere,This book dispels may ill-conceived notions people in developed world have about people in the rest of the world. Explains how the inability to put a value on assets in various parts of the world is a major cause for stymied growth. And the reason for this inability to quantify assets stems from the extralegal ways in which the assets are obtained.
books,2 of 2,5.0,The latest research and ideas on how to construct strategies and organizational structures to encourage and manage innovation,"Tony Davila, Marc Epstein and Robert Shelton's Making Innovation Work: How To Manage It, Measure It, And Profit From It draws upon the authors' experience as innovation consulting specialists to review the latest research and ideas on how to construct strategies and organizational structures to encourage and manage innovation. From taking innovation ideas and incorporating them into an existing business structure to devising a strategy for encouraging innovation and building networks within and outside the company, chapters provide specific details on how to get the job done"
books,5 of 7,5.0,Zig 's Book Contains Sales Power To The Maximum,"Many years ago I made the investment in Zig Ziglars book, finally the pages wore out from my numerous readings so I re-ordered and would not be without it."
books,9 of 43,1.0,Absurdity,"I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the ""extremely difficult themes"" and ""brilliant artistry"" of the play"
books,21 of 24,5.0,The truth and more,"I found David Shiplers book to be very true and to the point. Being a person of color, I already know how we (people of color) feel about race relations. I found it most helpful to see it through the eyes of a white  male. I have been tempted to buy a box of this book and carry it with me to  give to people. I believe everyone should read this book and debate the  content. Of course, not everyone will agree, but for those who are just  beginning to explore race relations, this is a great introduction and a  most interesting read"
books,2 of 7,1.0,Different world,"I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation.   I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual.  As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend.  maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience."
books,2 of 2,5.0,How to be Worthy of One's Suffering,"Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably."
books,3 of 3,4.0,A great thriller,"Wow! An intense read. At time the subject matter can be difficult to handle, but the story is amazing.  The movie does not do the novel justice"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Beautiful,"My mother was brought up very traditionally by my grandfather (who was from China), whereas I had a Western education and am currently living in the UK.  This book speaks to me - almost every clash of culture written in the book between mother and daughter happened with me; the language barriers, the difference in thinking.  I cried throughout the book and the movie because Amy Tan had managed to put all of it down so accurately"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A book I've needed for a long time,"I know that Dummies books are supposed to be easygoing and offer a lighter tone than most, so I was surprised to see this topic getting the Dummies treatment.  I'm glad to report that it works.  Excel Sales Forecasting is very reader-friendly, and it demystifies intimidating concepts like ""exponential smoothing"" and ""mutiple regression.""  I've done a lot of numeric analysis but not much forecasting, mainly because the available texts are so dense and inpenetrable.   No more!  This book provides the material I need to understand, clearly and with useful detail and examples.  It covers the basics and also dips into some more advanced topics.  It considers not just the number crunching aspects, but also the business context that you're forecasting into.  And it's fun to read!  We dummies have a secret:  we're smart enough to get books written for us that don't make our eyes glaze over.    This one makes the grade."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Best of Nora,"First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read"
books,,5.0,FANTASTIC - A MUST READ!!!!!,This book has been summarized often enough that I don't think it will be necessary for me to give yet another summary.
books,2 of 5,4.0,Very Good Read,To-date (may soon be overturned as I'm trying a new one from Tim Powers now) -- this is the best book Tim Powers has written.  I have tried some of his other stuff and it has been like he is a one-hit wonder.  The Anubis Gates is a very good read that he has not matched again in my view.  Here's hoping that my current trial of another of his books comes close to this one
books,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent book!,"The principles in this book have been very helpful. What it says is true in my experiecne too - unless we work to change from the inside and recognize our true potential we will bnever reach that potential. What we think and imagine is what we create. A great, easy read in spite of some really deep principles. Joe has a great writing style."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"not with a wimper, but a bang","Bukowski in his last years.  Rare to see a writer grapple with aging and death in such a matter of fact way.  There are some true gems in this one.  ....  Bone Palace is a little repetitive, but you can't be shocked to find Bukowski holding forth on booze, women, horses, hypocrites, and writing.  What else did he ever write about?  And really, what more can you ask for"
books,,5.0,Great book,"Some of the negative reviews would have turned me off this book if I had read them first. I have enjoyed this book, the Vampire, Geall setting did not turn me off. Actually It was a nice change."
books,2 of 2,5.0,GREAT BOOK!!!,This is one of those books you end up buying copies for your friends.  It deals with something we are all going to have to face.. the transition from this life to the next one. I really love this book    Thank You Mr. Dass
books,,4.0,Very Good Reference,"This is an important first book on DAM. It would have been helpful from the beginning to have a simple outline of the workflow steps, rather than illustrations of various phases throughout the book. Also, the work is too heavily dependent on Adobe and DNG. His arguments that DNG is the universal format of the future seem rather unsupported by facts and history. That said, this is a very well written book with enough universals to be highly recommended. It is a must read for the digital photographer"
books,13 of 13,4.0,A huge business hit of the early 90s that has aged pretty well,"This is one of the business classics in the past twenty years.  It has sold a huge number of copies and I am sure many of those purchased copies were actually read!  As impressive as its sales numbers have been, the way it has affected the approach to the way business was discussed and talked about for the past dozen years has been even more impressive."
books,10 of 14,5.0,Economics 001,"Explaining their own economic self-interest to blue-collar, redneck republicans is a bit easier than explaining geometry to gophers. All it takes is infinite time and patience. This book makes a valiant attempt to educate redneck republicans."
books,33 of 33,5.0,"Pragmatic, Useful, And Well Written","In this book Roger Lewis outlines the most important considerations in pursuing a career as an architect. I have always loved architecture, and have read extensively on the subject at the level of an interested amateur. When I was preparing for college in the 1980s, I wanted to pursue a five year professional architecture degree, but was dissuaded when I received a full scholarship in biology. That was an unfortunate decision in the long run, although I have been doing well professionally until recently, when my career field went into steep decline. I never forgot my interest in the subject, and while considering a mid-career occupation change, I have carefully considered returning to school and attempting to be admitted to a 3-4 year M.Arch. program."
books,2 of 5,2.0,Didn't really like it,"I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common."
books,13 of 13,5.0,A compelling social history told through sport,"For those of us who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, The Sound and Fury is a wondrous re-telling of the period through the lives of two unlikely partners, Howard Cosell and Muhammad Ali. It is not a boxing book. It is a work of social history, responsibly reported and told. Dave Kindred's superior writing and interviewing have made a book that should last for many years. The tales of Cosell's and Ali's lives, each up-from-bootstraps, and their accidental friendship, will impress even the most jaded sports fans and grownups."
books,3 of 3,5.0,the unkown hero,"The storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes.  Americans don't have to.  Abraham Lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness, yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties, which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic.  This book is a labor of love by Mr. Carnegie about his hero; it's his way of making his hero available to us all.  I love particularly the introduction in which Mr. Carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  All the wisdom and insight Mr. Carnegie ever collected in his ""how to"" books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here, because Lincoln exemplified everything that Mr. Carnegie ever taught.  This book is what will keep Mr. Carnegie's name alive, long after his institute has folded and his ""how to"" books have gone out of print.  In this book Mr. Carnegie captures the living reality of Lincoln, his wisdom, his virtues, his beautiful and unfettered English prose, his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind, his deep reverence, and his abiding love.  This is a book that you never finish.  The experience remains with you.  Besides changing forever the way you think about Lincoln, it'll change the way you think about yourself.  This book is not overtly religious, but I'd recommend it alongside Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship, Chesterton's Everlasting Man, and Thomas Merton's Seven-Storey Mountain."
books,3 of 5,5.0,The War Against the Terror Masters,"Excellent read for the 'beginner' who is trying to understand Islamic Extremism.  It gives the reader background information, details and explanations covering the major terror attacks in the last 25 years, and offers solutions as to how these ogrganizations can be defeated. The author also covers which countries or regimes are involved in the financing and supply of these groups as well as which states provide them with training grounds"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome Reference,"I can just echo the substance of remarks of the other reviewers on the contents. As an avid reader of mystery fiction, I can visualize opening a page at random and picking my next book to read.  As a computer programmer, I look at books like this and envision how I would write the program that would generate this information.  If the author did not use a computer program, I am doubly impressed. This book should be on the shelf of every crime fiction aficionado. If not on your shelf then that of your local library"

Now halfway through looking at these amazing women and reading their inspiriational stories, I am empowered and inspired.  Life is long, and the middle of it is fabulous! My first book was published when I was 53 and my next one is due out when, God willing, I will be 57.  So take heart all you ""women of an age.""  The best is yet to come, as the authors of this book and the women in its pages will show you.  You, too, can join this company in making this the most delightful time of your life!  Give this book to every ""Boomer Babe"" you know"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Love Story,"This book is a predictable love story, what we've all come to love about Danielle Steel's books. Perhaps we'd like a bit more UNpredictability, but most of the time I enjoy the story anyway. Reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have, that's always a good thing.

books,1 of 1,5.0,Solid Lincoln Primer,"There are a lot of Lincoln books out there and I was looking for, and found, a good starting point.  I thought this was a very even-handed portrait that gave you a sense for the man and provided just enough information on the politics and events of the day to provide context, without bogging down the epic story."

Why do people buy into this idiot with the ridiculous comb over; the emperor has no clothes, people!  The only reason he has any money is because the banks could not afford to call in his notes, he had such staggering debt, he would have sunk the bank..id love to know what his net worth really is..but you have to give the guy credit he does know how to get press, and his spawn seen to be a chip off the old comb over, they are as arrogant and frankly unattractive as he is, though i must admit his new child is a really cute kid...maybe a paternity test is in order.  How to get rich...drive up ur debt to such a level, and owe so many creditors that they cannot afford to call in your debt..priceless"
books,36 of 38,5.0,Fallaci writes another book exploring the possibility of global Islamic domination.,"""The Force of Reason,"" by the late Oriana Fallaci, is an interesting book which provides criticisms of Islam while exploring the possibility of widespread conquest of Western civilizations and Europe by the Muslims. Apparently, the opposition was not too pleased with ""The Force of Reason"" or her previous publication ""The Rage and the Pride,"" as they have attempted numerous times to have the text banned and Fallaci has also been the proud recipient of numerous threatening messages as a result of this, yet the text has become a bestseller in Europe and, apparently, North America as well, as the book is currently ranked at #8 on this site's bestseller list as of today. She shares some of these ideas with her readers by alluding herself to writer from centuries ago named Master Cecco who, in pursuit of standing up for his beliefs, was thought to be a witch who was later burned at the stake and then the reader is treated to a wealth of information concerning the Troy burnings. Fallaci wastes no time is sharing her views against Islamic terrorists and looks with contempt upon any civilization or religion that does not do everything within the scope of its power to stand up to them"

books,7 of 7,5.0,Love's Labors Lost,"Love's Labors Lost is one of my absolute favorite Shakespeare plays. It's completely hilarious, but still has Shakespeare's amazing way with words. In Love's Labors Lost, the Bard has created a highly amusing tale of men and their problems keeping oaths--especially when women get on the scene."
books,,2.0,Bach's is better,"The reader interested in Moss Hart and the golden age of Broadway will be much better served by going directly to Steven Bach's biography. Brown's workmanlike tome is short on style, short on feeling for the era (something Bach provides in spades), and the material from Hart's diaries doesn't amount to much. Compare Bach's thrilling re-telling of the birth of MY FAIR LADY with Brown's tepid version, to name one instance, and you'll see why Bach's is by far the better book. DAZZLER is indeed dazzling; Brown's PRINCE does nothing to de-throne Bach's definitive bio and lacks---dare I say---Hart"

books,,5.0,Great Chicago history!,"Extraordinarily well written.  Highly recommeded for anyone interested in, not just Chicago history, but turn of the century events"
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Very good,  but not his best","The plot for this is quite similar to Pamuk's Snow, though they are set in different times.  A man returns to Turkey and visits a former teacher who asks him to create the text for an illuminated book being created in the western style to impress Venice with the power of the Ottoman Sultan.  Just before his return, a gilder who works on the project is killed, and soon after he returns, his former teacher is killed.  All this is different from Snow.  The similarity is that he visits his former teacher in order to catch a glimpse of the teacher's daughter, an old flame who he has heard has been widowed.  She says she will marry him if he can find out who the killer is. And another, dangerous man wants her too.  So the love story is similar to Snow's.  How much you like this will depend on how much you prefer contemporary over historical fiction.  I felt this one was slowed down too much by long debates over the value of western vs. islamic painting. Rather than creating suspense these delays left me yawning despite their tangential relevance to the recent Danish cartoon controversy"

books,5 of 5,5.0,Infection,"I in 1996 I bought and read All the Pretty Horses first. Laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  Bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading Pretty Horses on the way.  Along with scenes from the Orchard Keeper, Sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that I'd rather see more of.  Sutree made me feel that I know this man, and could even like him.  Great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading."
books,4 of 5,5.0,How to eradicate poverty through profits,"As Prahalad explains in his Preface, he wrote this book to suggest and explain a new approach by which to solve the social and economic problems of 80% of humanity. His approach would mobilize the resources, scale, and scope of multinational corporations  (MNCs) -- their investment capacity -- in a co-creative partnership with localized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in order to formulate and then implement ""unique"" solutions to the problems of 4 billion people who live on less than $2 a day at the bottom of the ""pyramid"" to which the book's title refers. ""The process must start with respect for Bottom of Pyramid consumers as individuals. The process of co-creation assumes that consumers are equally important joint problem-solvers....New and creative approaches are needed to convert poverty into an opportunity for all concerned. That is a challenge."""

books,5 of 5,4.0,Entertaining and Informative,"When I started reading River's End, it reminded me of a remake of the ""O.J. Simpson"" murder.  It is a story centered on a little 4-year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father.  Years pass by and the story unravels Olivia's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy.  Written in the ingenious Nora Roberts style I have grown to truly enjoy, this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the Olympic Rain Forest through Olivia's eyes.  I guessed the villain about 1/2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as I could never be 100% sure I was correct.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone."
books,,4.0,A better entry than the previous couple of novels in the series.,"To the brilliant mind of Lincoln Rhyme it becomes apparent early into the murder investigation that there are two killers involved, working in tandem and perhaps one in slave to the other.  A ticking clock is left at the first puzzling murder scene at the docks, and it at first appears as if someone has been suspended until their painful death finally relieves them of their agony.  It's nasty, and its attention grabbing to a city that will always forever after be hyper aware of the danger in the every day.  A careful killer is calling himself ""The Watchmaker"", but for the investigating team that all seems a little obvious.  There are plenty of crime scenes, but where are the bodies?"

Abignale - one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was. This book is the autobiographical account of Abignale's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father's Mobil credit card. There are so many times in this book that I had to step back and think about the air of confidence that Abignale displayed, yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him."

books,46 of 47,5.0,A Transforming Text,"I was given this book in 1973 when I was a senior in college and wished to attend graduate school in clinical psychology. The book transformed me. I went from page to page recognizing that Roger's spoke directly to me and the way I experienced my relationship with my inner self and soul. This book review is written with the purpose of encouraging others to read this masterpiece of psychological theory. ALL psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and social workers should be intimately familiar with Rogers and his concepts."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Have a Plan and Develop Leaders,"This is a good read for anyone interested in church planting strategy.  Obviously this includes church planters themselves, but it may also include sending Christians who want to learn more about mission strategy.  Unfortunately, there are missionaries that do not allow future potential leaders to develop into leaders.  This book stresses the importance of developing Christians that will be able to lead.  Missionaries need to train and develop Christians in a way that allows them to be trusted with ministry."
books,5 of 6,5.0,What's really true,"I like this book because the author has obvious connected with Dragon. They have been much maligned in historical fiction what with stories of captured maidens and stealing gold and so forth. One might wonder why Dragon, with no use for such things, would go to the bother of stealing them. But of course, people tend to not wonder, do they? Those stories are entirely fictional and, of course, do not really represent Dragon at all. What are Dragons, then? They are highly spiritually evolved beings who chose not to continue to incarnate on this earth in order to help us and guide us from the spirit world. They are some people who are lucky enough to be born especially dear to a Dragon, and they have a lifelong Dragon guide from birth. For others it happens differently. Regardless, an actual Dragon spirit is not common as they were earth beings and so, obviously, limited in number. And whether we learn to connect with Dragon energy or we become able to connect with an actual Dragon spirit, Dragon is a loving, fiercly protective energy and being and should always be treated with respect and honor. D.J. Conway understands that, and so I recommend this book. It is a beginners' book, but there is always something for the ""advanced"" to learn in these books. No one person knows it all"
books,3 of 3,4.0,This one IS worth reading!!,"I couldn't bring myself to give five stars to a book which is &quot;just&quot; a review of fifty (plus)other books.  Review books seem like a great idea, but the problem with many of them is that they are, frankly, boring!  This one is different - whilst giving an accurate overview of each book, the author brings his own style and intelligent commentary into the review, such that the reader really does go away knowing which of the books he or she does want to make time to read from cover to cover.  We business executives are frantically busy trying to manage the new economy and few of us have time to get to all the background reading we know we should do.  Writing the New Economy gives us a genuine shortcut, and is the kind of easy read we can pick up on a train or plane trip, and gain real personal value (well, I did!). And it's bang up to date - at least it will be for a few months before the next tranche of &quot;e&quot; books hits the streets!  This one is a &quot;make time to save time&quot; book, and I for one am glad I made time for it"
books,1 of 17,1.0,What the Dickens is Dickens thinking?,"This book has nothing to do with anyone expecting anything great, so I hate it! This book is perhaps one of the greatest books of all time, but I hate it, because the title is misleading. What the Dickens does the author think he's doing giving this book a title like that!"
books,6 of 8,5.0,Wealth of information,"Foreclosure investing is all the rage nowadays, but Thomas Lucier tells you why you must get in during the PRE-FORECLOSURE phase to really make the big bucks.  There's just too much competition for properties once they reach foreclosure."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Would Reccomend,"I usually don't even browse through a DS book. For some reason I bought and read this one. I couldn't put it down, could hardly stand to take a break to sleep. I did cheer for Deanna&Ben.  Cried my eyes out over Pilar, even though her character in the book was totally unlovable. I did get frustrated in the end with Deanna and her reasoning behind not contacting Ben about the baby. The visual descriptions make you feel like you're really there. I liked the fact that Danielle and Ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and didn't play games about their feelings. The ending is a let down though. The epilogue should have been set a few years down the road. I loved it when Marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor editing and the not-so-great ending.  Would reccomend"
books,2 of 3,5.0,"Read it, Try it & you'll Believe it.","Simple concept, easy read, expensive book and worth 10 times the cost.  This isn't just someone's personal philosophy but a concept backed by irrefutable scientific studies. The most profound statement in the book is the proven fact that almost every interaction with others rarely has a nuetral effect. It almost always leaves the other person feeling more positve or negative.  That awareness has me looking for opportunities to apply this at home, at work or with the clerk I buy groceries from.  My life is twice as enjoyable as before because I am continually touching lives and spreading the joy."

Most have a subtle advantage over men and don't have to deal with the big ego problems of having to, ""know it all."" They just want to be winners and successful. Many just don't know where to start or how to get help. RICH WOMEN is a great start and savvy guide to financial freedom written for women"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Delightfull Collection of Written Art,"For those who already know the various authors of this book individually,  words will be in excess to describe the treasures contained therein. The  five Spanish already classical authors and Jorge Luis Borges closing the  group with honors are a guarantee of high quality and deep touching  entertainment. Tasting the fluent and sincere social verb of Quevedo, or  absorbing in silence the sweet and perfect mysticism of Juana Ins would be  sufficient to recommend this book. But we find much more, Machado, Garca  Lorca and Miguel Hernndez, marked by the horrors of the Spanish Civil War,  found in their sensibility, the way to transform hate and blood into the  purest and most powerful poetry. About Borges, well, what can one say about  a man of his talents, his well known depth is something you will find  easily linked to his enormous sensibility and human solidarity.  Definitively, this multiple anthology is a treasure to keep forever"
books,4 of 4,4.0,Fundamentally Sound,"This is the second Steve Berges book that I've read.  I read his book, ""The Complete Guide to Real Estate Investing"".  He focused on obtaining value once you make the purchase.  That is very sound advice.  With so many people investing in property hoping to make a profit after they fix it, Steve urges you to pursue profitability prior to making any modifications.  Do not pursue property that requires capital investment or upgrades prior to a positive cash flow.  That's very basic but sage advice"
books,3 of 3,5.0,The DC mythology as never seen before,"This book will astonish you even before you open it. The jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of DC, Superman and Batman, and below the jacket you'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every DC superhero battling versus their respective villains."
books,,4.0,Excellent and thought provoking,"I found this book really enlightening, both from a business and a personal perspective.  Mark's writing style is relaxed and friendly which made the book an easy read.   It is also very clear - no room for ambiguity.   I especially liked his comment on Think and Grow Rich - it has certainly made me think about reading a book versus acting on the information shared in the book."
books,6 of 6,5.0,A charming view of some wonderful friendships,"This interesting book discusses the relationships between several noteable people and their dogs.  At least one cynical Washington D.C. politician said that ""if you want someone to love you in this town, buy a dog,"" and you will find he was not the first one to conjure up that thought.  The author shows how people such as Florence Nightingale, Frederick the Great, Robert Burns, and Sigmund Freud were all warmly touched by the positive side of their dogs. These people, who somehow seemed so intensely boring in History class, never seemed so human as when interacting with their dogs. Dogs have served as companions for many others who needed a consistent friend, and they often served as inspirations for those who enriched our artistic and aesthetic lives (perhaps because they were so cheerful and so honest).  Oh, by the way, the author gives us some pretty interesting lessons in history and the arts, too, so this story is not just about the canids. If you are looking for a good book to curl up with, and read to, your animal companions, give this one a try"
books,11 of 34,2.0,boring,"Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations"

books,,1.0,Perhaps the series should have ended two books ago,"Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series."
books,10 of 10,5.0,A Must Read Book on Grammar!,"This book is a masterpiece that everyone, student or adult, shouild read.  It clearly illustrates the fundamentals of good writing and conveys complex ideas in an understandable way.

Plus, it is a very useful tool for highschool student studying for the SAT's or SAT2's in writing.  I highly advise anyone who wishes to improve his or her grammar to pick up a copy"
books,,5.0,Phenomenal Book,"The Think & Grow Rich Action Pack is a phenomenal book that will help you to reach your maximum potential, achieve your goals, build your character and develop your leadership skills. The Think & Grow Rich Action Pack is a great guide on how to ""personalize"" Think & Grow Rich to your walk in life. I discovered Think and Grow Rich when I read Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion and International Boxing Hall of Famer Ken Norton's autobiography ""Going the Distance."" Norton shared in his book that he read Think & Grow Rich and it changed his life. Norton's book states he was prescribed to read Think & Grow Rich after he suffered his first boxing defeat and had to start over. He then went on to beat Muhammed Ali for the title. Norton shares in his book that he read Think & Grow Rich repeatedly during his career and he became a stonger person for it."

The small family business grew into a Fortune 500 company, yet Mr. Beckett's faith allows him to turn his company into a blessing to its workers and community."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Ghosts,"Gilbert Ryle wrote this classic exposition on the mind-body problem in philosophy with a view to dissipate a myth fundamental to religion and philosophy.   His cogent exposition leads us to see mind in persons as other than a &quot;Ghost in a Machine.&quot;   More than this, though, his comprehensive scrutiny of the many elements of the life of the mind constitutes an incisive study of the synergy of mind and body in an integrated life.   Ryle exercises consummate skill in avoiding technical jargon to present a refreshing style for treatment of a difficult and elusive subject.   One of his favorite analogies is to compare a study of thinking as &quot;like trying to catch a jellyfish with a fine hook.&quot;   A thoughtful and careful reader will revel in Ryle's success with his daunting task"

That ought give the prospective reader some idea of its value.  On the other hand, it might be asked, what kind of book is this that purports to tell businessmen how to make money by selling goods and services to the poorest people on earth?

books,4 of 4,4.0,"The Invisibles, Book 1: Say You Want a Revolution","The Invisibles is the only comic I've ever collected from first issue to last.  When it started in 1994 I was a sophomore in college, and when it ended a few months into 2000 I was holed up in a soul-sapping corporate job.  Regardless, during those 6 years I was able to get my hands on each issue, despite the fact that I'd ""quit"" reading comics in high school.  But there was something special about the Invisibles, and it kept me coming back for more; I even set up a service with the local comic store so they'd hold each month's issue for me, and I'd come in every few weeks, grab them, and high-tail it out of there."
books,8 of 10,5.0,"Say what you will about his politics, this book is great!","First, let me state I have often judged other people by their past actions. Was Kazan wrong for providing names of alleged Communist Party members? I can't answer this, and you shouldn't answer it, not until you read this book! Yes, Kazan named names. Yes, he did ruin the careers of certain artists. Please, don't judge until you have read his story! This is an honest, masterful show business autobiography! Kazan was a fearless, authentic, visionary director. He admits to adultery, poor parenting skills, and using people for his own good. Alfred Hitchcock allegedly tortured Tippi Hendren during the filming of the THE BIRDS by having the little critters thrown at her face in repeated attempts. Why? To foster the character's psychological terror. Would you want that man house-sitting for you while you are on vacation? Hell no......Can Kazan be rewarded for his art, yet  escape judgement for his past behavior? You decide, but read his story first! Kazan's films never shirked from dealing with pressing social issues, yet the movies are visual poetry. Hey, you try to make a movie about corruption on the Brooklyn docks! Oh, and make it a heart-wrenching allegory, a love story, and a black-and-white masterpiece! One other thing, don't forget that the Mob basically controlled the docks at that time and were not too keen on being protrayed in an unflattering light!!"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Book!,"I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars"

books,1 of 3,5.0,Lucid examination of leadership's emotional base,"The authors of this clearly written book draw on deep research and numerous studies of psychology and neurology to show that great leadership is primarily and essentially a matter of emotional intelligence. Notwithstanding the extensive support and the documentation from academic literature, Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee have written an intelligent, lucid, easily accessible presentation. They contend that, with practice, you can develop the critical leadership competencies of self-awareness, self-management and social/relationship skills. Although the authors may understate the difficulty of developing these abilities, we find their arguments reasonable, persuasive and useful"

books,0 of 1,5.0,Epic out of time,"In recent years, a lot of people have noticed that book clubs demand a lot of books.  No surprise, but the next conclusion is that the taste of book club audiences influence what gets published.  I think this is why we have books like ""the Devil wore Prada"" that are soon followed by ""Prep.""  This is why people who read ""Evensong"" soon pick up ""Brick Lane"" and ""The Liars Club.""  My wife belongs to a book club.  They have read all of these books."
books,7 of 7,5.0,Carl Rogers' classic,"This is Carl Rogers' classic and a must-read for everyone interested in getting real with themselves.  The critic who edited this version indicates very successfully that there are important parallels between Carl Rogers and Ralph Waldo Emerson. This makes Rogers' philosophy and psychotherapeutic approach a truly American one, one that places the individual in the supreme seat of ultimate authority over his/her own experience and existence. The main message that Rogers develops from many different angles is this one:  there is no beast in man, and therefore there is also no need to fear one's innermost thoughts, feelings, longings and desires.  ""There is only man in man."" This was surely a revolutionary message at the time, and  remains to be revolutionary to this day, as so many modern-day religionists cling to the idea of man's ""innate badness.""  Rogers most certainly debunks that destructive religious heritage in his work. This book is a pleasure to read.  It is written in very simple, yet precise language and goes down ""like honey."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Insightful and thoroughly researched from my perspective,"I'm an employee with a small educational business, and I've started reading more business related stuff to get some perspective on how I can help our business evolve. I recently read ""First, Break All of the Rules"" and I picked this book up as a follow-up to get a different vantage point on growing a business. This study, completed in the early 1990s, focuses on 18 historically visionary companies that have built stable core cultures that can serve as role models for any business."

books,4 of 4,4.0,"Good characters and humor, plot that bogs down in the end","The characterization of Vladimir Girshkin is excellent, from how he looks and dresses (which morphs through the book), to how he thinks about himself, his family, his ethniticity, to how he perceives the other Russians and Americans around him. Many humoristic moments as Vladimir, in an effort to get himself out of a dead-end life, gets in with deeper and crazier schemes to extract money and respect from different criminal elements, all the while building (or rebuilding?) the ego inside the man. The characterization, as a trip of self-discovery, is very well written."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book and, not being a Grisham fan (AT ALL), this is really saying something.  I don't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading A Painted House by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found.  And right he was.  This story was touching and fast-paced.  It was enjoyable along the same lines as To Kill a Mockingbird (the only courtroom story I've ever enjoyed) in its background and overall feel.  I didn't like the ending - not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't flow with the rest of the book (a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together) but because it's not the way I wished it would go.  All-in-all a great book and highly recommendable"
books,5 of 6,5.0,Genesis of the Market Order,"Polanyi's classic is one of the most cogent treatments of the rise of market society ever written, and shows that conceptions of historical dynamics often cover over the fact that it is people who decide how to  create the rules of economies, there is nothing inevitable about them. This  account shows another picture of nineteenth century economic history  leading into the twentieth that revisionist history would often wish to  forget. A great and enduring work"

If you are looking to be transported (in beautiful writing style) to another place and time, buy this book!"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Good Resource for All,"My publisher recommended this book as I prepared to write my second non-fiction book.  I was looking for guidelines for proposal writing, and was not disappointed.  I found something helpful in each of the ten proposals the Hermans chose to illustrate their guidelines. The list of elements that need to be included in any proposal, no matter the genre, convinced me I'd do well to follow their advice.  I recommend this book for new authors looking for help getting their foot in a publisher's door"
books,1 of 1,5.0,The only thing I hate about the Reacher series,"My Reacher books (I'm in Australia) all come with the blurb on the back cover heralded by: ""Jack Reacher./Men want to be him./Women want to be with him."".  Personally I think this is cheddar city and actually detracts from the books appeal to the uninitiated.  If they hadn't been recommended to me I'd have probably picked one up, seen those 3 lines and gone 'gag,no way'.  I think I'll tell Lee Child myself via his website.  I'm a woman and I'm NOT reading the Reacher books to go gooey over Jack's attributes!  I will say this, they are cracking good reads and I hope he doesn't make the mistake of writing more in the third person.  Message to Lee: above blurb NOT A SELLING POINT!  Cheers"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Mandatory reading for every raising star!,"&quot;Business Systems Engineering&quot; is an excellent resource for anyone interested in creating a world class organization.  The tools of business systems engineering allows you to transform a company into a  learning organization capable of strategic change and excellence.  The  emphasis on &quot;adult learning theory&quot; and its role in reengineering  the work process is particularly refreshing.  Because strategic change and  leadership begins with learning, the emphasis on the work performed by  cross-functional teams of employees is essential to creating a learning  organization that can successfully respond to challenges in the  marketplace.  Case studies emphasize organizational learning and looking  outside the box, and demonstrate the use of benchmarking to identify the  best business practices and applying them to creating a competetive  advantage. Watson's holistic view of business systems as open systems that  are capable of improvement, easily promotes the integration of TQM  principles and the use of information technology.  The result of this  synthesis is the business system engineering model.  The model allows you  to transform your organization without sacrificing your focus on quality or  the customer, and is adaptable to any business.  It also helps you to  realize the value of employee training to support change initiatives for  profit.  If a change in your organization's culture is the prescription,  then Business Systems Engineering is the treatment"

books,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent read,"This book had me from the first line -- a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction.  Two stories are told side by side, one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes Jack the Ripper pale by comparison. The result is a book that is almost impossible to put down. It left me with an appreciation of the energy, talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world's fair and the genius of inventors like George Ferris."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Amazing,"I played college football and pro baseball.  I have very vivid memories of my coaches since childhood.  I had a coach in high school, Larry Book, who made a big impression on me.  He was great and I remember him fondly, though I liked him more after I left than I did when I played for him.  As good as he was, we never talked about life things, real important things.  Joe Ehrman's coaching style I've never really heard of or come across.  He explains what it means to be a man, to love, to give, in words that I never really heard before, certainly not from a football coach.  Even if you've never played football, this true story is one you'll want to read and share with others.  I have multiple copies"
books,9 of 43,1.0,Absurdity,"I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the ""extremely difficult themes"" and ""brilliant artistry"" of the play"
books,,4.0,Entertaining and Interesting,"One thing you should realize about this book is that it is not a detailed investment book.  If you are looking for such a book you should pick up something by Bill Bernstein or Jack Bogle.  The vast majority of this book deals with behavioral finance (and the stupid mistakes people can make as a result) and colorful stories of huge investment blunders that modern professionals have made.  I think it is critical to understand the mistakes that people can make because of their mood, fears, unbridled optimism, etc.  This book tries to adddress much of that.  The chapters dealing with huge plunders that professionals have made are entertaining and informative."
books,6 of 8,5.0,"Franklin, the French, and a ""damned near-run thing""","Schiff's understanding of the French is the key to this book -- that plus her lively writing style, wonderful wit, and the sheer craftsmanship of her phrasing and her story-telling. The book is a romp, through a trying and tedious time in the life of one of America's and the 18th century's most trying but least tedious characters."
books,7 of 8,5.0,simple eloquence,"Man could Buk write. But could he write. I suppose we are all just posers and pretenders and wanna-bes in his shadow, but Buk is essential reading for anyone interested in studying the craft and art and technique of writing, of, as Buk would say 'laying down the word,' and when it came to it, Buk could do it better than anyone. I've tried to write a passage with as much simplicity and elegance and attitude as he had and failed completely. His sparse prose and mastery of the obvious and attitude all contribute to a unique style in American letters that exemplify the beauty of our language when wielded by a master. Post Office, Hollywood, Factotum and Ham On Rye are MUST reads for any serious student of modern writing. And damned entertaining stories to boot"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Wars Differ but Shadows Repeat,"Historical events occur twice, one wooly philosopher claimed. His follower added, the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Not true, America's wars suggest. It's tragedy all along, and that's why you need to read or re-read this book now."
books,7 of 7,5.0,"Reading ""1984"" in Tehran . . .","The somber cover, the title, and the reference to prison abuses at the opening of this book are a little misleading. This memoir is not especially dark or grim, and the journey it recounts is an internal one, more from the land of ""yes"" than ""no."" It captures that particular youthful optimism that buoys up children and adolescents in the worst of times. And the Islamic revolution in Iran becomes the worst of times for the community of 100,000 Jews living in Tehran in the late 1970s, as the monarchy is toppled and the Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile to assume power."

This is definitely one of the most touching and wonderful books I have read this year or ever. It is written so beautifully that it makes you feel the characters' pain, love, dreams and hopes.

Most of his books are what I consider just sci-fi/fantasy; a good thriller read.  I think I'd have given this one a 5 if there was less fantasy.  I got the feeling he wrote this book in the hopes it would become a screenplay, a combination of a King/Spielberg wannabe.  I listened to this on audio, my Koontz first, and I found that in the midst of my road rage during rush hour traffic, I wasn't missing a lot of the plot.  I really could imagine this on film, and given the length of the audio book, minus all of the flowery descriptions, it would make a great 2 hour movie.  However, I got a pleasant surprise at the end, and I absolutely loved it.  His explanation of Armageddon vs. ""Alien invasion"" made the book, in my opinion.  It will make you think.  This wasn't one of his worst books, it was one of his best.  Give it a try."

Thanks to its lucidity, it is a rather quick read. Her writing is exquisite. But the content, ah, the content is indeed disturbing. No external enemy will ever destroy Western Civilization, its culture or its values. No, the West, if it is to be destroyed--will be destroyed from within, as it loses its will to resist and defend itself.  It is at that point that we will simply surrender--not to the barbarians outside the gate, but to those inside it."

books,9 of 11,5.0,A Well Organized Compilation of Warren Buffet's Essays,This book very effectively organizes Warren Buffet's essays.  Cunningham extracts selected passages of Buffet's essays from 1979 to 2000 and organizes them into chapters.  This is a great summary of Buffet's essays and well worth reading.  All of Buffet's letters for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders can be seen on the Berkshire Hathaway website.
books,0 of 1,5.0,Fabulous book--great summer read,"I bought this book in 1970 when I had just started college. It is one of the few books I have kept for all these years and have re-read regularly.  The premise for the story is a young man, Si Morley, who joins a government program to go back in time to the NY of 1880's. The past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story.  Not only is it entertaining, containing romance and mystery, but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today."
books,,5.0,The Detective Series about Nothing,"For years I was mystified by the popularity of ""Seinfeld,"" the comedy about nothing.  Nothing of any substance ever happened, and the protagonists were a bunch of shallow jerks.  The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series adopts the ""Seinfeld"" motif, but here we have a ""Seinfeld"" of a superior sort.  Nothing much happens in the stories, but the protagonists are a group of admirable characters.  Seinfeld & Co. worked through mundane situations with the ""hurrah for me, the heck with you"" attitude that scars so much of postmodern secular society.  In contrast Mma Ramotswe and her cadre of of friends confront the mundane with humble dignity and depth of character.  If you, the reader, can come away from the stories without feeling a deep affection and respect for Mma Ramotswe's circle of friends, you are hard-hearted indeed.  The success of the series can be attributed to the effectiveness with which Alexander McCall Smith mines the same comedic vein so well done in the Rumpole stories--large repertorie cast, engaging (but flawed) protagonists, dead-on observations of the human condition, and all leavened with good humor and good will."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Simultaneously hilarious and insightful,"Michael Lewis has an almost unique talent for providing one with an intuitive feel for a subject while simultaneously making you laugh out loud.

How is that even possible?"

Dr Lee's work is remarkable but you must read carefully otherwise you will be under misapprehensions like some of these other reviewers who are still making mistakes about the difference between natural progesterone and synthetic progestins!  They are molecularly different and natural progesterone does not carry the same side effects or risks that the synthetic ones do!  I am the Hormone Health Expert for the CMA and Bio Vitality Limited where we also advocate hormone testing so that you do not supplement if you do not need it!  It's really what the doctors should be doing before they give out hormones of any description

This book has helped me in making this decision, as well as in knowing what to expect.  If it does make you change your mind, then architecture is most likely not the career for you.  If it's worth doing, it probably won't be easy.  That said, it is not always as time consuming as people tend to think.  My fiance is working on her bachelor's in architecture.  While she is often very busy, there are times that she has a lighter load than I did in business school.  It depends on the prof. and the project."

Several reviewers have observed that the 900 page book is too long, but the abridged CD version cuts some of the detail and covers the major events of his life in six hours. While listening to Clinton's smooth southern accent I felt like I was sitting on a porch in Georgia listening to a fascinating person recount the highlights of his life and what he has learned from them.

It exposes both the high profile theofascists whom even moderate religionists recognize as a threat to their freedom to practise the belief system of their choice, and the behind-the-scenes theofascists who pull the visible fanatics' puppet strings.  Blaker's delineation of the Bush administration's conspiracy to abolish education in America and replace it with theofascist indoctrination is frightening, and should be required reading for anyone who disputes that the Christian Taliban is intentionally doing to America what Torquemada did to Spain.  While the Land of the Free is not dead yet, it is being systematically strangled.  Anyone who does not know that has not read this book"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Why it's still in print a hundred years later...,"H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.  Wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn't give one whit about the British (or anyone else's) false boast of superiority. In the end, though, it's a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren't biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn't survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that, it's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense."
books,1 of 1,5.0,enoyed,"i was really looking forward to this one because of mavis having her baby. Nora Roberts aka J.d. Robb didn't disappoint. Roake and Dallas both acted exactly as expected, with horror at the idea of being a part of the birth. Dallas and Roake both can wade through blood and guts but heaven forbid they deal with a baby being born. It was funny and on the mark. I enjoy Nora Roberts books and always look forward to the next one."
books,4 of 6,5.0,Great book!,"This is a great book, the best of its kind that I've seen. I would, however, take issue with the authors' advice not to pay for a crossbred dog. In my experience, a crossbreed (especially a poodle cross) is often smarter and better-tempered than some of the purebreds - and a good dog is always worth paying for"
books,0 of 1,5.0,Another hit,"Joel has done it again.  He has always had an uncanny knack for seeing the future and describing it in ways that help others understand and this book is no exception.  Regardless of which ""region"" view you believe is to be the future, you can not afford to be ignorant of the others.  This is a very valuable book for any CEO or exec that plans to be around for the future. Well done Joel, thanks."
books,15 of 16,5.0,"Simple, Clear, and Logical","This book is possibly the best design education text I've seen. Everything is kept simple, and clear. Ellen Lupton's categorizing of typeface styles, for example, is logical and all inclusive, yet still a simple breakdown of the vast variety of typefaces. She is easier to understand than Robert Bringhurst in ""The Elements of Typographic Style,"" something crucial to any budding designer. This book will serve you well"
books,4 of 4,4.0,Volcanoes,The book was very good.  My son just started second grade and he loves science.  The book kept him very interested throughout.  He has read it more than 5 times and continues to ask questions about the different new concepts that were introduced in the book.
books,16 of 16,5.0,All or Nothing at All,"This is the best selection to buy of Hawthorne's short stories because it is NOT a selection, it is complete and, if you believe the editor, it's actually more accurate in its assessment of what is and is not a Hawthorne story than some complete collections because he did not include here some stories that his co-editors on the Hawthorne Centenary Edition did want to include. (Hawthorne spent much of his career as an underpaid and unsung magazine writer and some of his work went with no byline and without reprinting at his own choice, so what he wrote is no easy matter to decide.) The stories are, you probably know if you're looking up this book, stark and wonderful. But some of them are also twee and a little fanciful and not so wonderful. That too is instructive. One very useful thing about this volume is that it includes a listing of when each story first saw print in magazine form and when in book form. In that way the reader can chart Hawthorne's development as a magazine writer and a professional which in every possible sense of the word he determined to become and despite some difficult odds finally was. Some of the most beautiful and terrifying stories in the language and a beautiful object to hold in your hand. Expensive, but if you can get it - this is the one to buy"

Then get this book ASAP, it covers just about everything one needs to know on how to get your degree. I really think the future of higher education is going this way. But if you want to spend a lot of time, money, grief and get a real ration of manure. Then don't read this book"

No writer does Washington DC like George Pelecanos."
books,,4.0,A New Office Ritual,"When I started work at my present job almost two years ago, I found that the place needed a little 'lightening up'.  It was casual already, to some extent, so on my next 'office supply' shopping 'trip'  I picked up this calendar for my desk.  Well, it began a new office ritual; everyone wants to know the &quot;Far-Side-of-the-day&quot;!  Sometimes, it's the only funny thing to happen all day.  Larson needs to come out of retirement"
books,5 of 7,5.0,One of the best Christian books on the environment,"I'm the director of a Christian environmental website, and I've read dozens of Christian books on ecology and the environment.  This is one of my all-time favorites.  I love this book!  It may very well be the best book on the Biblical basis for environmental stewardship!  Buy it for yourself, or buy it as a textbook for environmental study.  Outstanding!  What makes it particularly unique and special is that it is written by 4 biologists!  My only complaint is that there is little or no mention of the great Christian conservationist, John Paul II.  It's still very much worth a read"
books,6 of 6,5.0,THIS IS THE BOOK TO GET!,"This is the best book I have read on breast cancer because it addresses the biology of breast cancer with the reality of the symptoms.  It is written by a physician who knows what it is like to lose every single eyelash, and can tell you not only why you lost it, but how to keep on smiling without it.  This book has it all - even a whole chapter on the effects of aggressive chemotherapy on cognitive skills and how to cope.  When I read the tip 'jot down where you parked your car', I knew this was THE book for me  - I had already been doing this.   If there is only one book you are going to read on breast cancer, this is the one"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Indispensible  Advice,"Although a sole proprietor, I found Alpha Dogs to have great relevance to my own business.  I stayed up late at night, taking notes on all the advice I thought would be indispensible.  Ms. Fenn's writing style is wonderfully concise and lively.  I found the case study format to be much more engaging than anything didactic and the summaries at the end of each chapter make it easy to return again and again.  A great book for any entrepreneur, big or small, who aspires to be an alpha dog"
books,3 of 5,4.0,Surprisingly Good,I knew nothing about Daniel Silva when I bought this.  He happened to be one of the featured authors at my local Borders location so I figured I'd give it a try.  Wow was I surprised.  Gabriel Allon is a great character and he's not made into a superman of sorts...he's very human.  I'm glad I stumbled onto this series and plan on reading all of them
books,2 of 2,4.0,Oddly finding a good book,"Once in a while a book comes along that just fits perfectly into one's life for that particular moment.  The Last Odd Day is certainly that book for me right now.  Even the clever title, which notes that the date 11-19-99 is the ""last odd day"" until the next millennium, leads the reader to be assured that he is in for an amazing journey navigated by a very brilliant mind."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Favorites revisited,"It was great to return to the great characters in this family that Nora Roberts has created. To see what time has visited them with, and what happens to the lost little boy in the original stories. Score another hit"
books,,4.0,Don't Listen While Driving,"Good book for beginners and for those who have reached a place of discovery, but much too repetitious for me.  Don't listen to the audio while driving as Tolles voice is a monotone."
books,2 of 3,5.0,"Great ""Historical Novel""","This is a great book, which I would classify as a historical novel.  I read it before I went out to Gettysburg (along with all the two others in the series, which are just as fabulous).  I love the Civil War and work in archives cataloging many actual Civil War letter and artifacts.  However, to someone who was not too interested in the war, history or is younger this might not be a good book for them.  Nor is this book a supplement to actual research and factual histories. In the book, expect many reports about troop movements (war is 99% boredom, 1% sheer terror).  Expect lots of inner monologues, speeches, and flowery language because that is how it was in the Victorian era (it is the truth I have read enough letters to prove it).  I can say this book is one of the best historical fiction books I have read but it is not for everyone.  As for the movies based on this series, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, they have to be the most boring movies I have ever seen, just awful.  Read the book over watching the movie"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Change the way you look at the world,"The author of Tao Te Ching can never be found out with a hundred percent surety. But what is said is important not the one who said it. Tao Te Ching is basically a book that has great philosophical depth. Only religious books like ""Bhagavad Geeta"", ""The Bible"", ""The Quran"", ""The Dhammapada"" come close to Tao Te Ching. I personally feel The Bhagavad Geeta comes closest to this work. It is always a good idea to read these books in comparison.When you read the books in comparison, you will understand what the books are saying. What is clear in one book may not be clear in the other or vice-versa. Or you might find it easier to understand in another book. For example, there is a line in Tao Te Ching That says ""Act without action."" It needs great insight to explain that line. The Bhagavad Geeta speaks of acting without expecting reward. It should be understood that Lord Krishna or whoever wrote the Geeta is not talking about philanthropy. It is to act from a state where the one who is acting does not exist but the action goes through him. And since the actual ""actor"" does not exist he is not worried about the result or reward. I request you to read the books, ""Tao Te Ching"" { R.L. Wing's version is very good.} The Bhagavad Geeta { Paramahansa Yogananda's Translation is very good } & Be As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi (Penguin Books). I am sure you will never regret buying these books and if you read them properly they will change the way you look at the world"

It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell,OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out a old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman who's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice."

books,,5.0,FInding One Self and Fulfilling a Dream,"After being in an abusive relationship for ten years, I had feelings of hopelessness. I had no positive outlook about anything and the thought of a 'future' was slim to none in my eyes. I have always wanted to be a writer, but the misery that I was living in kept me from having a clear mind and my thoughts were jumbled and disoriented. In 1997, my parents bought me Simple Abundance. I read it, reread it, and read it again. I followed Sarah's suggestions and participated in all that she suggested with the wonderful inspiring activites she offered in the book. My book was published in May 2003! I have a wonderful marriage with my 'new' husband and am living my life as it is suppose to be. I am living the life God intended me to live. Thanks to Sarah Banbreathnach for sharing her insights and taking the time to write such a wonderful book that has changed a lot of lives for the better."

books,1 of 13,1.0,How not to write a fantasy (IMHO)?,"God, this book was awful! Not just the story, it was the construction that turned me off. The storyline is weak and the writing immature. Characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier. There is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events. I can go on but I guess I need to be more concrete."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Page turner until the end!,"This was a fantastic book.  It really made me think about the politics of organ donation and the hardship of having a child with a terminal illness.  The story is told from the perspective of each family member as well as the lawyer representing the well sister/organ donor.  I really felt compelled to side with the well sister, but as a parent I could empathize with the parents as well.  This book will keep you up late until it's finished...a great read"

books,,5.0,An absolute must,"I feel obliged to share my review of this book.  I got hold of it by chance and what luck! Like a lot of people I know the value of building relationships, because most of the best business I've had have been from by circle of contacts.  However, I cringe at the concept of ""networking"" and fail miserably at trying to leverage my network.  This book however got me to understand the DIFFERENCE between networking and relationship building.  I won't spoil it for you, but once you read the book and understand the difference you will immediately change you view of building relationships that unimaginably augment your financial, professional, social and philantropic efforts."
books,2 of 4,5.0,"You've read the books, now meet the man","Steinbeck's novels are some of the most powerful statements about American culture available on the planet.  But who knows the writer?  Travels with Charley lets readers get to know John Steinbeck, how he thinks, what he believes in, all with great wit and intimacy.  Steinbeck is a very funny man.  I even learned a new respect for poodles.  What else could you want in a book"
books,4 of 4,5.0,He Gets Better With Age,"I loved this book - Ram Dass has been a pioneer in so many areas, and now he's leading the parade of aging baby boomers into a whole new territory. I admire his courage, his humor, and his boundless spirit. This book is simply written, yet the message is profound. It was just what I needed to hear at this time of my life."
books,9 of 9,4.0,Not Your High School American History Book,"American history never made sense to me and now I know why.  As voltaire said, &quot;History is the lie commonly agreed upon&quot; and that's what was taught to me in school and is now taught to my son.  Francis Jennings tries to change all that with a &quot;revisionist history&quot; asking the questions that when posed by students in school are ignored by teachers. How did material progress evolve in a country that was already populated by over 25 million inhabitants?  Who owned america?  How did we shift from a policy of cooperation with the indians (a la Thanksgiving) to one of aggression. How much of our revolution was political and how much economic?  How did relations between colonialists and Great Britain deteriorate so quickly after so many years of harmony?  This book is an overview of much that Jennings has written in earlier books with some further thoughts and ideas.  What is most enjoyable is that he is willing to speculate, to question accepted fact and wisdom, to go out on a limb, to offer an opinion on various events, characters and situations.  For the first time american history became real to me: the people human, the events complex and contradictory, the struggle for independence understandable.  In the end a history not much different from what has been happening recently in Washington. The prose can be turgid; parts of it are somewhat academic but Jennings moves the story along and makes for me (a non-historian) very telling points. He left this reader with much to think about. I have since gone out and bought his other books and will be reading those in 2001.  A good balancing piece after this book is A Struggle For Power by Theodore Draper"
books,20 of 21,4.0,Good... but a bit dry.,"I bought this book based on the review by David Mills, author of Atheist Universe. I bought them both at the same time. Fully expecting Natural Atheism to be better, I read Mills' book first. Though Natural Atheism presents the arguments comprehensibly, I found it less interesting and far more dry than Atheist Universe. I would still recommend it together with Atheist Universe for a rounded expression of the arguments but I think the points could have been made in simpler language"

The responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed, and has now set his sights on Kenzie and Gennaro."
books,14 of 16,5.0,Unique Insight into Apartment Market,"The author, Berges, provides unique insight into investing in apartment buildings.  There isn't much written about this topic, and what is, seems to be very generic.  This book, however, provided lots of good examples with specific advice on what to do and what not to do.  In addition, Berges sprinkles various tidbits of information throughout the book that while not directly related to real estate, are nevertheless quite relevant to being successful in it.  I just finished another book of his, The Complete Guide to Investing in Rental Properties, which I also found to be very enjoyable"
books,1 of 2,5.0,California Beware!,"""A Crack in the Edge of the World"" is a great read that I especially recommend to all whom live, have lived or who have simply just visited the San Francisco region of California.  To all these individuals, it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906.  This book covers that momentous year and much more as well."
books,,1.0,Not much value,Bought it because the author had compiled the book on Buffett's annual reports. Got really bored with this book however.

Sure she implies that she is using positive training because she's using food, but she's also telling people how to correctly leash pop their dog. Even with the food training she's using 'okay' as a release word which means that anytime that your dog hears this word in a conversation around it, it is ok for it to break from whatever behavior it was currently doing."

This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad"

books,11 of 11,5.0,A superb introduction to Los Angeles travel and fun,"Free L.A. is an event guide rather than a travel guide per se, so tourists seeking a broader wealth of information concerning hotels, restaurants, etc. will want to supplement it with a more well-rounded guidebook. Free L.A. is a travel, entertainment and tourist guide especially for the budget-conscious - since all the events, activities, and things to do it lists in the City of Angels are free! Free festivals, museums, historic landmarks, botanical gardens, tours, concerts, art events, films, holiday celebrations and more pack this suprisingly thick little book. Arranged by month and season, each listed event includes an applicable phone number or website, a brief description, parking notes, information on whether the event is kid-friendly or has wheelchair/stroller access, and more. A superb introduction to Los Angeles travel and fun, and also an excellent resource for L.A. natives looking to enjoy themselves."

books,4 of 9,5.0,Definitely worth checking out,"One of the top five, if not the most interesting book, I have ever read. If you are familar with any Omega point theories, this is another one, but Tipler attempts to incorporate more traditionaly Christian elements as opposed to Hegel or Spinoza-like view of reality. I am not a religious believer myself, but if you have even the slightest interest in how a traditional theology might be merged with science, this book is definitely worth your attention"
books,2 of 2,2.0,needs a kick in the pants,"I picked this off the new nonfiction shelf at the library to see what a writer might have to say about the stage of life I'm in too. As others have said Atlas remains, I think, too wrapped up in the expectations of his privileged class--envying classmates who made more money, while living in Manhattan, sending his kids to private schools and maintaining a home in Vermont--methinks he doth kvetch too much."
books,32 of 32,5.0,A Christian Who Engages Culture,"The idea of the project How Should We Then Live?, both as a film documentary and as a book, was conceived in 1974 and completed in 1976. In the Acknowledgments, Francis Schaeffer writes about the idea behind the project: ""Using my study, over the past forty years, of Western thought and culture as a base, we could attempt to present the flow and development which have led to twentieth-century thinking, and by so doing hope to show the essential answers."" The subtitle to How Should We Then Live? is ""The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture."" Starting from ancient Roman times, tracing man's development throughout the Middle Ages, going to the Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment, he shows the steps which led to the modern era."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Easily Grisham's best..,"I was a little reluctant to read this one, mainly because I was so bored by Grisham's ""The Client"" and because I heard this was a ""funny"" book. Usually funny means excessively silly and cute."
books,2 of 2,5.0,I'm glad to live in the 20th century,"What a read!  Like Miss Koen's other historical novels, I couldn't put Dark Angels down 'til I reached page 530. I was so totally immersed in the court life of Charles II and the story of Alice,his Portuguese Queen Catherine's lady-in-waiting, I barely came up for air. Trying to speed read was impossible because every paragraph was filled with details and action that was not to be missed. Court life was so different from our lives today, the book makes for fascinating reading and not a little history in the passing, fictional or non. But I might say that at the last, it's as though the author got tired of writing her novel and decided to zip it up. The story came to a sudden and predictable ending, leaving many questions of ""what happened to"". Could this have been Koen's way of setting up for a sequel? Let's hope so"

Such pressing concerns, you see."
books,,5.0,Don't bet on the Mystery Cow...,"I know that it seems that I have moved away from reviewing cinema lately and have deeply transformed into this graphic novel reader, but it couldn't be further from the truth.  With my recent move, I have found ore time to be able to crack into these dusty books that have been sitting on my shelves for some time and fully experience the bizarre, yet imaginative, worlds that they boast.  I have witnessed the death of a superhero, the curse of a video, and now I am excited to say that I unknowingly jumped into the second chapter of Jeff Smith's Bone series.  I don't know how this happened, but instead of starting from the beginning, I found that I actually owned the second book of his series, aptly called ""The Great Cow Race"".  Unfamiliar with Smith's linear storytelling technique, I jumped into this novel expecting to understand everything that was laid before me.  I was unwittingly wrong."

Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain.  I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake.  It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again"
books,,5.0,an old favourite,"My children grew up with this book and loved it. Now I've bought it for my [...] grandchild. It's a timeless, gentle, wonderful little story about how sometimes life just isn't what we want it to be"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent and Engaging,"Although I loved Through a Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face, I wasn't aware of Dark Angels until I happened upon it in an airport bookshop. It is one of those rare books that is so engaging I was able to tune out all the miseries of flying and just read. And in this case, reading was pure joy. I loved the depth of the characters and details of the setting. Koen's characters are flawed, but in ways that make them seem real. This book is an example of how historical fiction should be done"
books,,5.0,Every once in a while....perfection!,"Oh, this was a grabber.  Nothing's missing in this thrill a minute saga - which has been voted ""the book I most enjoyed while staying in Barbara's guest room.""  Two guests now have been up all night reading ""Judge and Jury"".  It's featured prominently on my guest room book shelf with a strong recommendation that if they want to read a good yarn, this is it.  Although everyone reports favorably on the book, it does make for some pretty droopy-eyed siteseeing the next day.  I loved the premise of this one - felt I knew the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip to Ushuaia.  I never knew what the end of the world was like, but now I feel I've been there.  As a writer myself, I marvel at James Patterson's output. I guess if he experiences writer's block, he just says, ""Here, Andrew, you write for a while.""  Whatever the procedure, they hit an ace with this one.  And, what's really great is that while I'm still riding the crest of the wave on Judge and Jury, the news reports another new book about to be launched - ""Cross"".  I can't wait!"
books,2 of 4,2.0,700+ pages of reader suffering,"This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second."
books,,5.0,Great Book,"About a year ago, I checked out this book from the school's library (I was very suprised they had a book on vegetarianism). It has alot of information on becoming a vegetarian, has Q & A sections and tells you about different kinds of non-meat diets, such as ""fruititarian"", when you only eat fruit. I think all children and teen vegetarians should read this book"
books,26 of 26,5.0,Flavorful,"All About Grilling, is a refreshing book of new ideas for outdoor cooking and entertaining.  I was very impressed with the different combinations of ingredients, the presentation of the meal, the grilled side dishes, and the rubs and sauces. I received the book as a gift and have enjoyed using it for my summer entertaining.  I am now purchasing a book for a friend"
books,2 of 4,5.0,Escape From the Never- Ending Darkness,"""Night"" is a frightening book written by a man who saw the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand. Elie Wiesel survived years of torture, malnourishment, and dehumanizing conditions as he was forced to travel from one concentration camp to the next during the height of Nazi control. He was separated from his mother and sister and never saw them again. He watched his father gasp his last few breaths before authorities took him away during the night and disposed of him in a crematorium."

books,7 of 9,4.0,"Dark, disturbing, haunting","There is no denying the strain of Faulkner that runs through McCarthy's early works; like his predecessor, McCarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place (here, the hills of Eastern Tennessee) interact.  But McCarthy is more fun to read; his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind's eye.  He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  &quot;Child of God&quot; is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.  But that is one of the great joys of Cormac McCarthy's early novels--they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of  beautifully painted landscape and haunting, nightmarish imagery"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Mitch Rapp is Jack!!!,When I read a Novel I try to see how quickly I can figure out what will happen next.  It was very easy to do with this novel.  There is one surprise in the end that I did not anticipate.  Nevertheless I liked this book very much.  It is a good escape for a few hours.  '24' watchers will like this Novel.  Mitch Rapp is the Novel equivilent of Jack Bauer.  I also believe that Vince Flynn is giving us some idea how the CIA really works and because of the times we live in I don't think it is too much of a stretch to see this Novel as an education in what is happening today with the FBI and CIA - but don't forget this is a Novel!!
books,3 of 5,4.0,"Quite, quite good","I really enjoyed this latest memoir of Mr. Burroughs, almost as much as his first - RWS, Dry and MT.  My favorites were his essays on Cow & Bentley, his French Bulldogs, Julia's Child, and the essay on his paternal grandmother.  There were a few that seemed like he might be reaching for things to remember to fill out the book, but overall it was with much enjoyment that I read his latest"
books,,5.0,Another good one by Lehane,"What it must look like to be inside his brain!  Another good read, got a little confused on one part, but overall a great book. But don't forget to finish up with Prayers for Rain, it's greatness"
books,7 of 7,5.0,Paula's the BEST,"To the lady who gave Paula's book a 1 star because it's all fattening & salty foods--puhleeze!  She said she watches the show--do you really?  Paula is a southern cook and southern cooking is full of rich food; she always says her favorite food is butter! Her cookbooks are fantastic; every time I make something to bring to the office or to a potluck, I use one of her recipes and they always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  She's the tops"
books,4 of 6,5.0,An excellent book for pregnant couples,My wife and I receieved this book as a gift when we announced her pregnancy.  It is by far our favorite pregnancy book.  The week-by-week format is perfect for following along with your progress and also makes it nice to read together.  There are even helpful hints for dads along the way.
books,1 of 1,5.0,What fun,"Great characters, the book stays true to its genre without losing the element of surprise.  Good summer read"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Absolutely illuminating,"Avi Shlaim is a rare authority of the kind who honestly portrays the truth. He meticulously unravelled the knots in history and came out with the true events that shaped Israel and its relation towards Arabs since 1948. He deconstructed the history by analyzing many documents and showed how the and why the Israeli leaders behaved and reacted to scenarios, how was their interrelation, how they perceived the security facts and what was their relation to the military commanders. I was looking for this kind of book for long and finally found it in Tanya Reinhert's book (see my review on this book). He showed that how true is Kissinger's aphorism about Israel is true: ""Israel has no foreign policy, it has only domestic politics."" It was so true. Although he showed that USA has rather balanced policy toward Israel, at least till the 1990s, but from a lay person's perspective thats hardly the case. How come Israel has so many F16s and Pakistan had to burgain for years to buy F16s ! Anyway this book was very educative for me, it helped me to learn objectively about the Arab-Israel conflict, and thus to counter the stereotypes of many of my Egyptian friends, for example."
books,,1.0,STAY AWAY!!,"I would give this book a zero, if it were possible..."
books,4 of 12,4.0,Courageous and illuminating,"It's been interesting to watch the transition in John Stossel's politics over the years.  His ideas mirror many of my own.  I started out as a left liberal and have been increasingly moving towards a more ""libertarian"" position.  I've also received a lot of flak for that, especially in the women's movement where I was active for decades."
books,4 of 4,4.0,"Good book, informative and educational","Peter Lynch writes well and this book has some classic wisdom that lets you into his mind.  One drawback is that Mr. Lynch may sometimes forget just how smart he is and tends to over simplify some aspects of investing analysis that come to him naturally.  For example, asking a clerk at a retail store what sells well is a technique Mr. Lynch will use on occasion to evaluate a stock.  However, it's key to note that he also has a great deal of resources in the form of advanced technology and research tools, not to mention personal genius."
books,,5.0,Even Girls Love Tucker...,"Yes... I'm an actual girl who purchased this book, read it, and laughed until I cried.  If you aren't easily offended and enjoy a good drunken story, please -- buy the book"
books,3 of 4,5.0,A tapestry of voluminous nuance,"Immediately I can detect the luminous presence of magic in this slim volume. Although thin in pages, it is deep in meaning. Without much in the way of characters or plot, it sustains and enlightens.  Laconic descriptions of fantastic cities woven together in a tapestry of voluminous nuance. Topics of memory, perception, vision, time, loss, longing, desire, death, signs, symbols and ultimately meaning are all carefully chosen and arrayed. Upon finishing this book, one has the feeling of have eaten a delicious meal too quickly. That upon reflection, it should have been savoured slowly"
books,9 of 9,5.0,A Good Book -- Just Short of a Great Book,"Evan's ""Third Reich in Power"" falls just short of being a great book.  I would rate it a ""9"" if Amazon had a ten-point rating system.  Evans concentrates on the period between the elevation of Hitler to the chancellorship and the German invasion of Poland in 1939.  Evans uses what might be called the ""mosiac"" method.  He examines most of the essential features in which Nazism attempted to regulate and direct the lives of the German people, and does so in succcessive chapters.  This is an interesting approach -- rather unusual for contemporary history --, and is reminiscent of that taken in, say, Cambridge's Ancient History and Medieval History series.  No ""grant theses"" emerge, but several themes suggest themselves."
books,8 of 8,5.0,Menopause in a whole new light,"This is the first time I have read something so enlightening concerning menopause.  Dr. Northrup has a way with words.  I love the way she writes. I thought i knew all there was to know about menopause, and some how she makes me feel more normal"
books,6 of 13,4.0,A new light for the media.,"As a student at Oklahoma State University, I am very interested in journalism and broadcasting.  Eric Alterman's book opens my eyes to many new ideas about conservative and liberal media.  The purpose of the book is to inform people of the different bias parts in the media.  Alterman does a wonderful job of showing both the conservative side and the liberal side in the media.  After reading through the book, I came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than I look at it.  I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media"
books,1 of 1,5.0,A real page turner,"I wont go over plot or characters because you can get that in other reviews, what I will say is this book is a great read. I finished this one in about 5hrs,I did not want to put it down.Patterson has a great knack for characters and real dialogue between the characters.Nothing is too overtop or unreal in this story."
books,1 of 1,5.0,this is hilarious!,Jenny McCarthy is so funny! This is a must read book weather you are pregnant a new mom or have been one for years. Sometimes she's so honest it's scary but it deffintly does not freak you out about being a mom. I highly recommend this book! I've just started reading life laughs by Jenny McCarthy.

books,2 of 2,4.0,Not Bad,"I read this book after watching the movie (staring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio). Before I started I knew I liked the story, but I didn't realize how much. I loved reading Abagnale's account of his life of crime. I enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot, a doctor, a professor, and a lawyer. I also liked the novel's open frankness about the author's misdeeds."
books,0 of 1,4.0,Beyer brings it together,"While probably not the best handicapping book even from the Beyer set, this is one of the more entertaining handicapping books around.  You should read his earlier stuff first to see how he evolved as a handicapper to incorporate some ideas such as pace, trip, and form cycles, where earlier he had largely dismissed those.  Where I spent a lot of time taking notes from other handicapping books, I spent more time turning pages and just enjoying a good read here"

books,7 of 7,5.0,Coaching + Systems Thinking = Transformation!,"The author integrates coaching with systems thinking and the learning organization popularized by Peter Senge's book ""The Fifth Discipline"". This revised edition shows the Hargrove's approach is still fresh and surprisingly unique, given all the recent books published on coaching."
books,5 of 5,4.0,Another great novel by Reichs!!,"When Temperance takes over on an archeological dig on a small island off the Carolina's, her thoughts center on her relationships, her nearly divorced husband and her tentative relationship with her boyfriend.  As confusion reigns supreme in her personal life, professionally she is about to face another challenge involving what appears to be a series of similar murders.  Is there a serial murderer loose on the island? As she gets closer to the truth, her life and those around her are in imminent danger.  Can she protect those she loves and will the resulting circumstances change everything she feels to be right."
books,3 of 3,5.0,"More Novellas, Please","Hopefully Ed McBain's effort in convincing a stellar cast of fellow writers to contribute the novellas that comprise ""Transgressions"" will induce publishers to encourage more of the same."
books,2 of 19,1.0,Book full of assumptions,"This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from &quot;addiction&quot;. The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the  men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system"
books,,4.0,A quick read.,"I enjoyed this book, detailed plot and different than most of his other books"
books,9 of 14,5.0,A Damn-Near Perfect Book,"Even for the already-converted, this is a great book.  Normally I'm not too sympathetic to lefty books that will cleary be read by a number of conservatives that you could count on your hands and maybe one foot.  But even the choir will find this a well-researched, even-tempered, fair assessment of the liberal media myth. And best of all, the American public comes off looking like a culprit as much as a victim.  Ultimately, people vote with their eyes, ears, and wallets.  If the public demands and devours media slop, then that's what they'll get and, to a large extent, deserve."
books,5 of 6,5.0,Superb,"These cookbooks cover it all, Paula Deen is simply the Queen of southern cooking. I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves to cook! Only exception would be people who are really watching their weight, because Paula is also the queen of butter, and it's really hard to eat small portions :)"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Not for Dummies -- a note from the author,"This is my newest book out and I hope you take a look at it.  Unlike a lot of grooming books, this one is the most conprehensive when it comes to grooming your dog.  Whether it's training your dog to accept grooming, handling bad-hair days, getting your dog ready for the show ring, or dealing with medical conditions or real hair emergencies, this book handles it all in a friendly, fun and conversational tone."
books,3 of 5,5.0,Scaming the truth?,"The disparaging reveiws about this book, to me, can mean only one thing: there are people out there who don't want the truth to be told. Is there such a thing as the Gypsy Mafia? Yes. Are they costing all of us by perpetuating their very lucrative scams? Yes."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Almost perfect,"I have read several books on verbal self defense and this is by far the best. It contains techniques that are simple and easy to remember. Most of these methods are in the form of a statement that you can make. The only thing you have to remember is that although these tactics look and read very good on paper, real life situations are a different story, in that, when you employ these techniques, people might not react the way you anticipate them to in the short term. But, I am confident that if you employ these tricks on a regular basis, you will see some positive long term results"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Masterful,Masterful story of the Master of the Senate.  Make sure you read vol.s one and two - they are as good.  Having no interest in LBJ before I started the series - I can't get enough!  Look forward to the final chapter.  This book covers his years in the senate - and wow what an interesting man - he was a horrible individual who was blind with ambition - truely an American legend
books,,5.0,One of my favorites.,IT is one of my favorite Stephen King novels I've ever read.  Possibly in the top 10 of all my favorite books.  It is extremely long and I must admit that I had to take breaks during the reading of this novel to get few quick reads in but this book was worth it.  I know it's cliche to say so but the movie does this book no justice.  Of course a movie that would do it justice would most likely be a week or so long.

books,3 of 5,5.0,A Great Addition to Your Bible Library,"I think the 1611 Holy Bible King James Version is a must to complete your Bible collection.  Complete with the Apocrypha, the 1611 edition will give you in your hands an exquisite replica of the original KJV.  One thing about the KJV, it really, along with the writings of Shakesphear, solidified the English language."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Two decades of Ross' comic book art come to life,"DC comics fans who love comic art collections must have MYTHOLOGY: THE DC COMICS ART OF ALEX ROSS: it's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters Ross' art brought to life over the decades, from Superman and Flash to Green Lantern. Included also is Ross' new comic book series Justice, new sketches, and an oversized coffee-table format which helps display and profile, in full color, Ross' entire line of DC Comics superheroes. An original Superman and Batman story written by graphic designer Chip Kidd, a re-telling of Robin's origin written by Paul Dini, plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover MYTHOLOGY appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own."
books,10 of 10,5.0,An  Important/Imperative Book,"From a George Bush perspective, I read.  Hence, I must be a   Revolutionary. But for me reading is essentail. In Rafael's book, ""Scaramouche"", the establishment games the system by dueling the people's representatives with their skillfully commissioned swords. They literally kill the people's will.  Today's fait accomplis are the skillfully commissioned penned instruments called NAFTA and WTO. The perpetrators behind these instruments  were a political crew of bloodsuckers. On the American side they included: Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton, Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Al Gore and Henry Kissinger. These penned agreements were inserted with poison pills designed to adversely effect constitutiions throughout the world, including ours. But you'll never hear a discouraging word about them from the corporate mainsteam news. Get the REAL down and dirty of globalization and read ""THE Global Class War"".  Read it and weep... for those you had placed your trust in, and to the republic they signed off on. Learn to distinguish between the interests of stateless transnationals and we the people whose economic fate is bounded by the nation.  The poor class has already lost what little they had. Now the middle class is in the cross hairs and slowly being squeezed out. Unfortunately, they have taken us all aboard their hellbound corporate express called the bottom line.  A must read for those who want the truth."
books,17 of 20,5.0,"Practical, delicious selections","First, it is not true that ""none of these recipes seem to be original."" I too find it very irritating that Cook's repeats so many recipes from publication to publication, but that is not a significant problem with this volume. Some things that may appear to be repeats actually turn out to be reworkings--ie, Chicken Vesuvio has been reworked into a ""weeknight"" casserole (a slightly optimistic description), and the gumbo here has chicken rather than shrimp (a change from their previous recipe). I usually get the new books from the library and copy out the new recipes that interest me, but this one would be worth buying."
books,3 of 3,4.0,another great series,"If Alexander McCall Smith had stopped with Mma Romotswe's series, he would have gone far to prove he's a great writer with insight into human nature and a fabulous sense of humor."
books,12 of 13,4.0,the book is Real Simple - but don't let that deter you,"This book reads extremely fast.  The page layout is attractive (just like the magazine), but alas this arrangement includes a lot of white space.  Many of the tips are too familiar, e.g., sprinkling lemon juice on your fruit salad to prevent browning, and some advice is applicable only to homeowners or parents (I am neither - yet)."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Summers End but another beginning,"What I love most about Danielle Steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character, and this one is no different.  She has had, in my opinion, some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her"
books,13 of 13,5.0,A most interesting guide - but inconsistent,"This is a fascinating buying guide to classical music recordings with many positive attributes.  It is full of interesting historical context of the composers and their works and fascinating performer trivia, making it quite entertaining and educational in addition to comparing the many recording choices.  Compared to Penguin or Gramophone, it gives MUCH MORE in-depth backgroung on each work's history and significance.  Also, there is a lack of any ""British bias"" (since published in USA) that some cite with Gramophone or Penguin (both UK published).  Case in point: American pianist, Garrick Ohlsson's superb eight volumes of Chopin on the Arabesque label.  Third Ear is the only guide to extensively review each of Ohlsson's Arabesque CD's while there is not one mention in the 2003 Penguin or Gramophone.  Bias?  Perhaps more likely the Brits are just not familiar with all the musicians ""across the pond.""  Its really impossible for any one guide to be the ""end-all"" guide."
books,3 of 5,2.0,Is this really Taoism? Say it is not.,I picked up this book because it seemed so charming. The author took the stories and characters of A.A. Milne and juxtaposed them with the Taoist teachings of people such as Lao Tzu.

Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen."
books,4 of 5,5.0,How CFOs move beyond managing numbers,"Jeremy Hope's REINVENTING THE CFO: HOW FINANCIAL MANAGERS CAN TRANSFORM THEIR ROLES AND ADD GREATER VALUE  tells how CFOs are moving beyond managing numbers and reports: now companies except them to provide strategic support and leadership to enhance manager performance and bottom line alike - on top of their jobs of budgeting and processing transactions. Jeremy Hope has co-founded the Beyond Budgeting Round Table, a nonprofit collaborative helping organizations improve performance management - and REINVENTING THE CFO tackles the nuts and bolts, outlining seven roles CFOs must embrace to change their company's finance operations. An excellent set of reflections on the changing CFO role and how to achieve the most from it."
books,0 of 7,5.0,"Meet Jesus, God as He Really Is","I must admit I was surprised by how many people gave this book bad reviews. This book offers a biblical account of the return of Christ based on what we know from the Bible, especially from the book of Revelation. I was more surprised for the reasons that were used to justify those bad ratings. Since so many others have used this page to support their views, I have decided to do the same."
books,23 of 24,5.0,The most comprehensive book about Vietnam ever!  My highest recommendation!,"Subtitled ""John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam"", this 1988 non-fiction book won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and I can well understand why.  I'm an avid reader of books about Vietnam.  However, this 790 page epic, with an additional 70 pages of acknowledgments, footnotes and indexes, makes all those other books seem lightweight.  Sixteen years in the writing, every word has been scrupulously researched.  Not only are there detailed descriptions of the battles, however.  The reader is given the opportunity of looking at the really big picture of the politics of the time.  I'm not talking just about the national politics though.  There were politics inside the military and between the Americans and the South Vietnamese.  We read about real people and the human disaster and the interwoven complexities of waging this war. And, central to the book, we learn about of Lt. Colonel John Paul Vann whose opinions of how the war could be won often differed from those of his superiors.  But we learn more than just about his military expertise.  We learn about the man himself.  We never really like the man.  And yet, we do come to understand him with all his warts and demons."
books,,5.0,Best read in years!,"I didn't bargain on getting a complete understanding of quantum physics from a great work of fiction, but that is what I got.  You can be in two places at once. This work of art is the most enjoyable book I have read in years.  Rollins is to be commended for outstanding writing, research, plot development and overall hyper-speed fun"
books,5 of 9,1.0,Size Matters,"This miniature edition is too small to be of much value.  When I purchased it, it was not at all obvious that it was a miniature edition, and I was shocked when it arrived.  If you're already familiar with the book, it may be a helpful reminder, but it is no way to become familiar with Dr. Peale's work.  It is not worth the 4.95 I paid for it, and the 3.99 shipping and handling is ludicrous"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Lessons of money and redemption,"Grisham delivers again with this great story about the dead billionaire's strange last will, and the redemption of the broken lawyer who sees the light.  This has a spiritual message that is subtle, sincere, and uplifting, yet not beaten over your head.  You'll walk away understanding how money can be a curse, and if you don't believe that, give this book a try"
books,7 of 7,4.0,Thought-provoking ideas for improving the quality or quantity of work,"I've been thinking for my living for 30 years so I found it useful to get the perspective of a leading management consultant and thinker. Davenport has lived through business reengineering, been part of a large consulting organization and seen inside many corporations, so he knows the subject. His book is written in a conversational style, so it's easy to read. Its content is useful and it contains some valuable insights. In particular, it builds on and fully acknowledges the work of Peter Drucker, who coined the term ""knowledge worker,"" as well as other thought leaders, which is refreshing, since so many authors do not acknowledge that they ""stand on the shoulders of giants"" and thereby deprive their readers of valuable context and background to their work."
books,3 of 5,5.0,When God Winks on Love is Great!,I thought this book was  very intersting! The book was very easy to read and very informative.  I related to the book in many ways. I agree with what squire says about love and relationships. I learned alot of what he says about godwinks and love.  It was very much like the first book which made it easy to understand
books,6 of 6,5.0,A Necessary Addition To Any Mid East Library,Former Israeli president Chain Herzog's account of the wars/conflicts between The State of Israel and her Arab neighbors is a riveting history. The book covers almost every Israeli military operation from 1948-2004 (this refers to the most recent version updated by former Israeli Intelligence officer Shlomo Gazit).
books,1 of 2,2.0,Eh...,"This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the ""bad guys"" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock."
books,2 of 4,5.0,Making a Difficult Process Clear,"I've just come back to Fierce Conversations for about the tenth time.  Scott has developed the clearest instructions on open, direct communication I've seen in 20+ years of working with clients around communication issues.  She gives easy to understand guidelines and supports each with excellent examples.  Anyone who has been around long enough to have read the early texts on Action Science will appreciate Scott's ability to put complex concepts into understandable action.

books,1 of 2,5.0,Amazing Genius!,"A Quantum Leap of reading.  How his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable, and personal, story around each one is an amazing feat.  I found myself wondering if he did travel back in time - was it possible - could I do it?  I even tried the self-hypnosis he told about - picking the civil war as my target.  No -- didn't work for me - yet!  Would I love to do it!  The ending of this book shook me - he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way.  It's amazing.  Read ""The Mirror"" , read Diana Gabaldon's time travel series -- but please don't miss including this book as your number one, best dog eared copy of your library.  You won't be sorry"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Best of the field.,"I'm reviewing this as an afterthought. Of its genre ""The Stand"" is, without question the best. And the story is, in my opinion, the greatest Stephen King has done. I've read the other reviews and I won't go into specifics, however, if you enjoy reading end of it all types of stories you will love this book. Another reviewer complained about it being lengthy. Well, you don't have to read it to realize that. But the story and characters are original and well developed. The plot progresses smoothly to an exciting climax with lots of incredible things happening throughout. And I've read it three times"
books,,4.0,Another Great Book!,"I don't go into the plots of books when I review them as many have already done so. I always look forward to another James Lee Burke novel, and Pegasus Descending does not disappoint. Dave Robicheaux is one of my favorite protagonists -- a man who is not perfect, has his weaknesses, but always tries to do the right thing."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Best Lincoln Rhymes yet,Although the plot twists in Deaver books sometimes are a bit of a stretch; they are certainly never dull.
books,3 of 4,5.0,Well written and suspenseful interweaving mystery and history,"Eye of the Wolf by Margaret Coel ISBN: 0425205460  - Due out today (6 September 2005) - I was sent an ARC of this great book to read for review which I do gladly.  I had read a few of this series before and especially enjoyed them, especially Spirit Woman and Story Teller, so was expecting good things.  I was not disappointed - the series follows the adventures of Father John O'Malley, pastor of St. Francis Mission on the Wind River Reservation and tribal attorney, Vicki Holden and apart from a ripping good mystery, the author weaves the history of the Arapho and the Soshone tribes who share the reservation into the fabric of the story she is telling so well, bringing her characters and the culture to sympathetic life.  It is not hard to care about the ""Indian priest"" as they call Father John or Vicky Holden.  I think what I enjoyed most was the character studies of not only the main characters in the story but the peripheral ones as well - they were brought vividly alive by the author's words.  From the first mystery message ""This is for  the Indian priest"",  everything seems to hark back to a famous battle in the 19th century and the treachery that took place on the battlefield  - but does it??  This is a very worthy entry in this well written series and will keep you guessing right up to the finishing twist as everything becomes clear in a highly suspenseful finish."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Not your average gift book!,"We all have those cast-off generic ""gift books"" that lay around in some unused corner of our dwelling.  You know, the books with children's letters to the tooth fairy, or little flowery poems about mothers.  These books are hastily bought up from Hallmark stores and Walgreens each generic holiday and tossed in a gift bag with some half-rate chocolates and a crumy 99 cent card in our last-dash effort to conjure up a last-minute gift.  These are usually obligatory gifts that we feel we have to give, even though we may really love and care about the recipient and feel like a jerk because we can't think of something else, at the last minute, to gift them with on our way to Aunt Helga's family reunion, late as usual.  Two days later, your gift book finds its self laying with other passed-on rejects at the inventory check-in counter of your local used bookstore while the clerk groans to see yet another gifty bound volume of mushy valentines prose. Being continuously re-gifted is the career of these books until some kind soul mercifully chucks them to the trash heap with a mighty swing of disgusted zeal."

books,,5.0,NO!!!! Don't leave NOW!!!,"So basically everyone reads the two MAGICIAN books and thinks ""Whoa, that was a great series"". But they don't even suspect that the next two books could have anything to do with books 1&2. Wrong. In fact, they have so much to do with the books that that in book 4 the real Riftwar ends. But this book sets up for book one. This, in my opinion is the worst Riftwar book. But since I loved it, how much do you think I liked the others."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Be Prepared for an Eye Opener,"Even a few years after it's release, Eric Schlosser's ""Fast Food Nation"" still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies... not a purveyor of good food--or nutritious food for that matter."
books,0 of 1,2.0,It doesn't get any more predictable than this...,"The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again."

books,18 of 18,5.0,"At last, a real overview of Shakespeare for adults with imaginations","This is a wonderful, rich, exploratory book that holds nothing back; a meditation about the Shakespeare canon that resonates in all planes at once. It is certain to be [...] by college teachers everywhere, and so it should be; together with Shapiro's 1599 as a biography and a solid encyclopaedia like the Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, this is one of the only supplementary volumes you'd ever want to shelf next to the Complete Works. This is the kind of full-service critical homage and investigation Shakespeare has been waiting for all these years. I hope he and Marjorie Garber meet in Heaven, and that someone leaks the resulting sonnets"
books,1 of 1,5.0,What the other reviews are leaving out is,"What makes the invisibles such a powerful story are the characters and how they relate to each other.  When the character relationships aren't in flux, attention wanders.  I think that the series improves when King Mob throws his guns away and things get extra whacky.  Many other reviewers have accurately reported how uneven this first collection is because of the departure taken in the time travel arc.  The story shifts its focus onto characters who are not so easy to relate to."

books,0 of 1,2.0,Interesting...but confusing,I agree with much of what has already been said as far as the amount of filler and the editorial glitches.  And can anyone figure out the last chart -- table 11.1?  These numbers make no sense and don't even correspond with the info on table 9.1.  I began the book with some excitement but ended up feeling very uncertain about the method
books,5 of 7,4.0,Forget about the fact that this guy is a fraud...:o),"If you can get past the scandal that revolves around this book and actually read it, you will not be disappointed.  This is a MUST-READ for anyone who has been touched one way or another by a drug or alcohol addiction."
books,6 of 6,5.0,A Must Read!!!,"Communication and caring compassion is the key to teaching.  Hendricks uses the acronym, ""TEACHER,"" to relate his concepts.  The examples of teacher-student interaction shared in his book illustrate the importance of communication and show of care that motivates students to learn.   He states, ""The greatest teachers are not necessarily the people up front with high visibility.  They are the people who have great heart.  They communicate as a total person, and they communicate to the total person of their hearers (87).""  Another way to be a ""person of impact,"" is to be ""vulnerable"" with one's students.  Not only are communication and compassion important, but preparation.  Hendricks relates, ""Teaching involves a delicate balance between facts and form, between content and communication, between what you teach and how you teach it (77).""  If teachers want to prepare their students to ""think, learn, and work,"" then four skills need to be taught: ""reading, writing, listening, and speaking"" (48).  Though this book is written for Sunday school teachers, it contains helpful suggestions for use in other teaching venues.  For instance, Hendricks suggests a ""self-examination"" in which teachers ask three questions: ""What are my strengths; what are my weaknesses, and what do I have to change?"" (35). Great teachers are the ones who continue to grow in their own personal learning. Hendricks' book is a good reminder for all teachers of the main purpose for Bible teaching.  Even if the teacher teaches in a secular institution, the basic principles of the book can be utilized.  For instance, students will be more willing to try harder and put more effort into their school work if they know the teacher truly cares for them."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Immense,"I was drawn to Bill Plotkin's book the week it was released.  Over time I have gone back to this profound message and taken more to use in my life as I work toward life purpose, life intention.  The 'coincidences' of his story are nothing less than the spiritual power of life itself that we all experience every day, if we only take time to decide to be open for them.  Powerful truths for heart and soul in these trying years of an old and tortured world.  There is peace and hope."
books,1 of 6,1.0,shallow self-indulgence,"I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Final Gifts and Simple Gifts are the Gifts you remember,"Final Gifts is a VERY SPECIAL BOOK.  It is a guide for those who have never witnessed the death of a loved one or someone who is approaching death.  The authors are exquisitely sensitive to the needs of the dying.  The book is a vehicle for enabling the grieving living and dying to come to terms with fate and appreciate the wonders of life's final journey.  Although not esposing religion, the experiences expressed have considerable spiritual content.  It is a book one can read quickly, or as I preferred, to read in sections, contemplate, and read on"

Samad worries that his sons are being corrupted like all the other children in England. Alsana does not ever want to go back to India because she feels her family is safe in England. But Samad would not agree that ""safe"" is as clear as Alsana thinks it is. The minds, traditions, rituals, and morality of his sons are being eroded and destroyed. His sons are not safe. To him, Alsana is only ""thankful [they] are in England . . . because [she] has swallowed it whole,"" believing the lie of safety that promises physical security while your cultural foundation is eaten away beneath you."

books,12 of 14,1.0,Snake oil for sale,"Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, &quot;The Food Pharmacy&quot; by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce"
books,12 of 14,5.0,The birth process of Islamic Fundamentalism in London,This book expertly describes how and why the Muslim community within London gives birth to a group of radical men whom go on to committ terror throughout the world. The author questions why England has not confronted these sects more head on without the worry of insulting Muslems. An interesting and worthy point is one that indicates that living in England does not give anyone the right to denounce the goverment to the point of  proclaiming death to the goverment officials. Maybe its time to send these people back to the 'war torn' areas from which they came from and allow them to express their 'freedoms' and collect ' state financial aid' there. This point is raised and the reader has the option of agreeing or not. The best thing about this book is that it was written and demands that action be taken place to quell an uprising taking place

With each book in the series, you'll find out more about how to create and use balanced scorecards . . . and your organization will prosper because of it."
books,5 of 6,5.0,Introduction to Faith,"This book is abound with breathtaking insights, i had a look at it and liked the title as i was beginning a study on prosperity, because in my life there was a lot of financial uncertainties and believed a lot of rubbish about succeding, from this book i learned to affirm myself and the world around me, as i realised that prosperity is not about who raised you, what your career and level is, but upon the level of faith and spiritual savvy which is easily obtainable if one only asked for it."
books,1 of 1,2.0,Nothing Special,"I had rated this book a ""two"" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one."

books,2 of 3,5.0,A Classic of Conservative Thought,"In 1789, the year of the French Revolution, Burke received a request from a good friend living in France to provide his thoughts on the Revoution. The result- one of the finest pieces of political discourse ever written. For those encountering Burke for the first time, his adament defense of the crown, and of hereditary succcesion, seem to make a hypocrite of this self-proclaimed liberal. Burke, however, was not defending an absolute monarch who ruled under the charter of divine right, but rather, pointing out the danger of a perfect democracy, whose sovereign (the national assembly) was compelled not to a moral authority such as a Church, nor to a fixed consitution. In short, liberty was safer restricted in civil socity, than left unchecked."

books,2 of 2,5.0,The Best Book I Read in 2005,"And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many."
books,3 of 10,2.0,Way overrated!!!,When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good.
books,14 of 15,5.0,The single best book on programming Excel,"The typical Excel programming book is often like a VBA cookbook.  Just a succesion of VBA code snippets and at the end the reader has a nice collection of VBA recipes, but doesn't really know how to cook.  This book will show the reader how to cook."
books,1 of 18,2.0,Blah,"This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a ""Did you get it?"" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks"
books,1 of 2,4.0,This book is already outdated!,"Granted, ""World"" is a great bunch of stories about how our global community has become flattened; but unfortunately for Friedman, the book is already outdated.  That's why the recent 100-page update was necessary, but a book on the history of such a changing landscape is quite like a detailed drawing of the Mona Lisa on an Etch-a-scetch, which someone keeps shaking up.  I'm not saying it's impossible to give a detailed description of what's going on in the world today in a book format, but maybe some of the things that the author described in his book (open source ssoftware and new web applications like blogs and user-drivn web content) are the only way to really get the updated version of our history.  There's nothing like a printed book, but perhaps that media cannot fulfill the needs of a modern history"
books,5 of 5,5.0,A Great Resource,"I'm a BFA student at Virginia Tech heading to grad school and this is an excellent book to teach from, have as a reference, or just thumb through for fun.  Simple and succinct while still thorough.  It's really an invaluable thing to have for ready info at your fingertips.  This book has been part of the curriculum here for Performance Art, Found Object Sculpture, and Installation classes, and everyone in the class universally approves and finds it helpful"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent read,"This book had me from the first line -- a perfect example of real life being more enthralling than fiction.  Two stories are told side by side, one about the fair itself and another detailing the crime spree of a serial killer who makes Jack the Ripper pale by comparison. The result is a book that is almost impossible to put down. It left me with an appreciation of the energy, talent and sheer will it takes to put on a world's fair and the genius of inventors like George Ferris."
books,4 of 6,5.0,Far Superior to the Calvin and Hobbes Collection,"This has always been my favorite comic as I was growing up.  I lost track of it after it left the papers, and I am sad to say I had nearly forgotten good old Gary when I heard about this box set.  It is amazing.  I paid full retail for it, but it was still worth every penny.  This book is amazing, and you will not be disappointed.  From both the quality of the humor and the essays that provide intersting depth to what the Far Side was all about, this is a book for completists, leaving out only a small bit of material that was in the book Prehistory of the Far Side.  Also, unlike the Calvin and Hobbes Set, this has high waulity and stays together.  The pictures are on the materials, not lame stickers that fall off after putting it away once or twice.  This set rocks, buy it"

books,,4.0,Very Solid Book,"My first complete Dickens book was ""A Tale of Two Cities."" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature"
books,12 of 59,2.0,Saying what you want to hear,"My only conclusion about the popularity of D'Souza is that he writes what his audience loves to hear.  His opinions, and that is all they are, opinions with little concern for research, analysis, and refutation because they are so general, must strike a nerve in many 'young conservatives' who feel they are unappreciated.  However, that doesn't make his ideas right regardless of how much one wants them to be. That any author would presume to be able to make a comprehensive analysis of current political ideology in so short a book is rather insulting to people who spend their entire lives seeking the truth.  That this forum is in the form of a 'letter' is condescending to individuals who want to arrive at truth.  If one is inquisitive about how the world works, why read the pre-digested views of someone who immediately places himself in a one-up position with the reader?  Why not go out and learn about the world yourself?  Are people so afraid that their biases just might be unfounded?  If so, it does not say much for one's self confidence."
books,7 of 16,5.0,Another Great Book by Paula Kamen,"I loved Paula Kamen's first book &quot;Feminist Fatale,&quot; which probed the reluctance of young women to call themselves feminist, even though they supported  feminist ideas and goals.  &quot;Her Way&quot; is also extremely interesting. Kamen interviewed lots of young women and argues that they are rewriting many of the old sexist scripts -- at work, in relationships, in bed. She finds them assertive,  independent and energetic, with high expectations for equality and intimacy, sexually frank and in control of their lives to an unprecedented extent.    A well-written, optimistic portrait of a generation that doesn't usually get such good press"

books,4 of 7,5.0,He died in Africa-- I think that says something.,"Standing alone, this is one of the great books of the last two or three centuries. When you consider that it's author eventually gave up on America and died in Africa on the eve of the March on Washington, it makes it perhaps the most necessary book for black people in America ever (nods to THE PHILOSPHIES AND OPINIONS OF MARCUS GARVEY notwithstanding)"
books,3 of 4,4.0,Great addition to this series,I have already written a review on the entire left behind series but i think that this book in this series deserves ALOT of credit for setting the path for the second half of the series. This entire series has been one of the most enjoyable reads of my life. Whether you are a believer or not you can easily find this book to be an enjoyable read.
books,1 of 1,5.0,Outstanding,"This is just a tremendous piece of work.  I've read a lot of focused revolutionary war items and to say that some are ""readable"" is a gross overstatement.  This reads almost as well as a good novel."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great Read Again and Again,"This is my all-time favorite book.  In one word - POWERFUL.  Grisham does an excellent job at bringing the characters alive and making you care about them.  There is a lot of description to help you understand the south at a time when blacks were begining to be people, not things.  Wonderful"
books,15 of 18,5.0,One of the best mysteries I've ever read,"I enjoy reading mysteries and have read quite a few in my time, but I've never before come across anything like ""The Woman in White."" I'm always a little skeptical when I hear a book being described as a page turner but that description fits this novel to a tee. I found it very hard to find a stopping place each evening and lost more than a few hours of sleep, but it was definitely worth every minute!"

books,3 of 3,2.0,Not for me,"I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked."
books,10 of 12,5.0,Powerful and Thought Provoking,"I have read literally thousands of books in my lifetime, but I have never read a book quite like this. First, I am from Wisconsin and have actually been to many of the places that Tina mentions in her story. Second, I too have struggled for many years with serious depression. I've never actually attempted suicide, but I came very close to it one night 10 years ago. It is only by the grace of God that I didn't attempt suicide that night. I truly believe that God intervened in my life that night. Even though I didn't yet know Christ as my Savior.  I have struggled with serious depression off and on for the past 15 years. There have been five or six periods in my life where I have felt seriously depressed for months at a time. There is definitely a stigma in the church when it comes to depression.  A lot of people simply don't know how to handle it. I could relate to so many of Tina's struggles. Tina's story is also my story. I am so thankful that Tina had the courage and strength to share such a deeply personal struggle with the world. I believe that this book will give hope to those of us who struggle with depression. But I believe it will also help those who have never had a problem with depression to be more compassionate and understanding. Struggling with serious depression can make you feel so alone and like there is no one who really understands. But this book showed me that I am not alone in my struggles and that even if no one else does, God understands and cares. I cried numerous times as I read this book. This book has helped me believe that there is hope and help is available. I do not have to suffer alone. Reading Tina's story also makes me want to begin counseling in order to deal with my depression and other issues openly and honestly."
books,9 of 9,5.0,Security in a New Light,"Since 9/11, the security industry has been evolving.  The need for standards in the industry is imperative and this book discusses a varity of industries and their standards of care.  This book is a great reference for anyone in any industry that is looking for information on security. Building Security: Handbook for Architectural Planning and Design is a must have."
books,2 of 2,5.0,DEUCEDLY FINE BOOK!,"I can't possibly say enough good things about this book and its author! The first thing which struck (and stuck with) me is that Osipa is an animator first and foremost; Osipa spoke my language from the first page! Basically, he simplifies the many elements which go into facial animation and has come up with a virtually fool-proof yet expandable system based on combining several blend shapes at a time into an extremely flexible series of facial expressions! Previous books either left me marooned with a gazillion blend shape sliders, or otherwise barely explained the process at all in any clear terms. Osipa's book concentrates on facial animation as it applies to lip sync and facial acting!"
books,9 of 10,5.0,AIDS: A Biography,"Good stories work on several levels; they are multi-dimensional views of the same event. To honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I reread Randy Shilts's groundbreaking work, which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the CDC."
books,5 of 5,5.0,The one you need,"After I read Marlon Brando's own memoirs, my view on him changed. That he was one of the most brilliant actors in history is a fact most people are aware of, but what fewer know is that he was a very intelligent man who helped discriminated folk groups more than many. I knew this even before I read this book, SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME. But what I was not aware of, was how sensitive and funny he could be when he felt comfortable. I believe much of his ""tough"" behavior simply was an image. Not all the time, of course, he was very masculine and could --which he admits in this book-- be brutal at times, but this side of him is obviously exaggerated by the press through the years."
books,0 of 1,4.0,Fills in a lot of blanks - barely,"Dont know much about History does pretty much what it purports to do; fill in certain blanks in US history in a concise, almost too concise, manner. It is quite objective and makes no attempt to re-write history to promote a particular political leaning - until the final chapters. Then it is fairly clear that Dr. Davis leans a bit away from the status quo. This poses no real problem, as most of the Viet Nam generation are quite negative as to how that was handled. Now, the next edition of this book, which will of necessity deal with Irak, will be a very interesting read"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Remarkable Insight,"I wholeheartedly recommend this historical novel to anyone interested in learning about the Civil War.  In fact, I recommend this book to anyone NOT interested in the Civil War.  This is the first Civil War novel I have read, and I was completely captivated.  Michael Shaara gave life to many of the key figures in the Civil War's most famous battle.  Although, much of the interior dialogue is fiction based on historical documents, the details of the action stay true to history.  Shaara provides amazing insight into the essence of the war, the ""Cause"", and provokes a feeling of kinship with officers from both sides of the battlefield."
books,9 of 10,5.0,awesome,This is an outstanding collection of essays. I could easily relate to many of the postives and negatives of relationship commitments that all of the women discussed. I found this book a breath of fresh air

books,13 of 15,5.0,This book Changed the way I trade,"After suffering a loss due to 'Unreasonable Exuberance' in 1997, I was about to quit market. I borrowed this book from library and from the very first page I felt as if Mr. Elder had written my trading biography. This book was a retrospect on my trading psychology/habit and realized my wrong approach to market. I read this book couple of time so that I fully register Mr. Elder's teaching and started trading again. It has been 9 years, I read this book, once every year just to make sure I do not deviate from my trading discipline. Every trader once in his trading life must read this book."
books,2 of 6,5.0,One of my favorite movies of all time!!!!!,"Back in the 80's when I was about 7 or 8 years old, this 2 part movie came on TV and we recorded it, of course it was on Beta back then.  I totally fell in love with this movie.  After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it.  So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away.  They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much.  To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it."

Now the two of them are working together on a ranch in New Mexico in the early 1950s."

books,5 of 8,5.0,fabulous legal thriller,"The poetic macabre message shakes up Father John O'Malley, the Jesuit Pastor at St. Francis on the Wind River Plantation.  The caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths.  Not long afterward, at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the Shoshone betrayed the Arapaho to the cavalry, three Shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here."
books,,5.0,How we will miss the Shiksa Goddess,"Wendy Wasserstein's untimely death in the winter of 2006, at the young age of 55, robs us of what should have been decades more of her witty, generous-spirited but sharp, wise feminst humor.  These essays are a delight, giving us much over which to ponder and chuckle, even in our sadness, knowing as we do that  the mind and spirit creating them have left us.   Read them to savor baby boom feminism in mid-life, and to honor the memory of a great woman of letters."
books,,5.0,Preaching for the choir has never been done better,"As some other reviewer pointed out, unfortunately Dawkins with this book is preaching for the choir. But hopefully it will give the more sane portion of the population some ammunition to meet the dogmatic rantings of the deists. His writing is sharp, witty, and cuttingly sarcastic, and an easy read, even if you don't agree to all his points."
books,1 of 2,4.0,poignant,"An insightful look into a life, with lots of universal truths to be had.  While some of the essays threatened to lapse into tedium from time to time, they were all ultimately rescued with honest insights into life.   Especially poignant were the chapters on the death of the author's father and on failure.  There was much in these essays that spoke to me.  I'd recommend this book to a friend"
books,2 of 4,5.0,college basketball junkie Ed Daly,"A great read!  While its main theme is the 2005 Final Four, Coach Roy Williams and the Tar Heels of North Carolina, it provides a wealth of historical information on how March Madness developed over several decades.  It also provides the reader with an insight into the politics of the NCAA tournament as well as how the TV revenues influence many of the decisions made by the selection committee."

books,11 of 11,5.0,A gorgeous tribute to African culture for children,"""Ashanti to Zulu"" presents 26 African tribes, from A to Z, and lets children learn something about the culture and customs of each one.  Aside from being a learning experience, the book is visually eye-popping; the illustrations are so gorgeous you'll want to blow them up and frame them.  The book won a well-deserved Caldecott Medal for the best illustrated children's book of 1977.  It's a great book for helping children to learn about some of the peoples of our least-known populated continent, and the pictures will hold the kids mesmerized.  It's a volume that belongs on every youngsters bookshelf"
books,14 of 16,5.0,Excellent resource! Ignore pre-biased reviews....,"I suspect the previous review from ""Mom Of One"" must be unnaturally biased or somehow associated with a competitor's title because it appears that she only exists sporadically enough to tout her chosen title, and then belittle its competitors. Nothing else currently seems to exist for this entity. Worst of all, ""she"" disclaims this book as being a copy of a title published in 2005 (first edition 2003), when a quick look-up shows that  this publisher: Meadowbrook / Lansky, has been making baby name books since the late 70s/early 80s and is clearly one of the leaders in the field."
books,10 of 14,4.0,Catty but worthy of a certain respect,"Having worked in several different sectors before arriving in fashion, I can say that there are lawyers, CEOs, doctors, etc. who are as equally psycho as Anna Wintour. But not too many people would want to read about a neurotic Hospital Director! It seems that some people who bought this book aren't even interested in fashion and have no real perspective on Vogue magazine. If you aren't fascinated by the subject matter, why buy the book? I have read every US Vogue since 1982, have lived in many European countries and am extremely familiar with other Vogues around the world and work in fashion, so I can say with full conviction that Anna Wintour is very important in her field. Fashion is a business like any other and it comes down to money. She turned UK Vogue around then came to NY and turned US Vogue around. I agree that she is pretty psychotic, but in general, you're kidding yourself if your think market leaders can be ""normal"". Who cares if she is a good writer or not? She DOESN'T write! She is a fashion editor and her magazine is THE most influential and financially successful in the world. Every other fashion magazine in the world is based upon what shows up in US Vogue whether we like it or not. And she does know how to pick interesting writers for her own publication! Do you think most CEOs can type their own letters or do market research? No, they are there to lead and make decisions. I love hearing the gossip on her, so this book was fun to read, but I do respect her immensely from a professional point of view. Appreciate the book for what it is - don't act like your profession (or colleagues) are more respectable or holy than the those of the fashion industry. And by the way, dressing well is part of the job in fashion. Would you expect a IT professional to not use a computer???!"
books,2 of 4,5.0,Alan Shepard - Write Stuff,"Having read most of the books about the glory days of NASA, this one stands out as one of the best. Unlike a number of the recent autobiographies of the astronauts, Shepard would not have written this book himself. He was too private a person. Thompson has written an engaging chronicle of what it takes to be the best of the best in the astronaut corps"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great travel book.,"I have read this book two times, once as a teenager and now 40+ years later.  It is a great book and easy to read.  I was amazed as a teen ager, and now, how such a famous author would do such an ordinary thing as travel around America in a camper and write about it.  He can do more than write well about things, he shows how to really observe and absorb experiences around him"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Unbelievably good!!!,"I cannot say enough good things about this book.  This series is some of the best writing James Patterson has ever done!  Not only am I totally hooked, but my daughter, grandaughter, and tons of her friends are as well.  This book has made the rounds through all of us and my grandaughter's other middle school friends are begging to borrow it as well.  If you haven't read the Maximum Ride series yet, PLEASE grab Maximum Ride The Angel Experiment FIRST then move straight on to this one.  All I can say is - I can't wait for the next installment!"

books,1 of 1,4.0,"excellent read, should have been included with HOL","I've read House of Leaves twice, and neither time I felt like I was able to get through Pelafina's letters. However, it was much easier to read all of them in The Whalestoe Letters. Perhaps because they are all included in proper sequence? The introduction is nice as well"

books,4 of 4,5.0,Just Gorgeous,"This book reprints 6 special comics and does them justice. Alex Ross's art not only looks great, but tells the story well.The pretty pictures do not get in the way of the story. The book is smaller size than the originals, which were the size of the old LIFE magazine, but the art is not impaired in the least and the production values are top of the line.What makes the book worth having, though, are not the pretty pictures but the stories.Paul Dini writes stories which make each of the characters examine themselves, bringing us along in a thoroughly entertaining manner. He makes them very human, complemented by the art which is very lifelike (Ross uses human models.)The Batman story is the best, the Justice League story the weakest, although that is a relative judgement since it is a pretty good story.At the time the stories were first published, I had wished that the 5th volume would be a Plastic Man story and still feel that would have been a better way to go, but such was not to be. Regardless, this book will remind you why we love superheroes."

books,7 of 20,2.0,Really now...,"Do you look like this person on the cover? If not, you may want to rethink this book. I got it as a gift but plan on ""regifting"" it soon. It makes yoga a game of accomplishment rather than an honest practice for normal people. Interesting Asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it, but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life, not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young Indian boys. For a different view, take a look at ""The Yoga of Heart"" by Mark Whitwell."
books,,4.0,Gabaldan redeemed herself with this book,"After reading the ""firery cross"" I was skeptical when I started this one.  I thought that it might not be up to her usual standards (like the 5th book - firery cross).  Ms. Galbaldon is back to her exceptional standards.  If you were disappointed by the 5th book, don't let that discourage you from getting this one.  I enjoyed this one very much and look forward to reading her forth coming books"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful book!,"I am fairly new to Nora Roberts.  But this book is not only my favorite by her, it's one my favorite books altogether.  It was so well written it made me feel like I were diving and hunting treasures myself!  And it has such a sweet, romantic storyline.  I was really sorry to see it end.  I hope there will be a sequel.  I recommend any woman to read this book, whether you like romance novels or not"
books,1 of 4,5.0,Perfect bio of this ice-queen fashionista,"This book is ah-mazing. It gives you all the details on mostly everything you ever wanted to know about Anna Wintour. This book will make you run out to purchase Vogue and flip through to the masthead page just to see her name, that, this book verifies, is bigger and bolder than everyone else's."

books,3 of 18,5.0,great and practical advice,i agree with all the other reviewers.
books,2 of 3,5.0,No holds barred look at power.,"If you are looking for a feel good book, this is not it. But if you are looking to understand how powerful people think and work, this will give you a glimpse into how they use others. Without moral judgements and prejudice, Robert Greene disects historical and literary examples of how people use other people for good or ill. Whether you are looking to use others or just avoid being used, this is good place to start. The game of power unvarnished in all its ugliness."

books,0 of 1,4.0,It is one of my favorite books,"I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October"
books,119 of 123,5.0,Attorney at law,"I'll never look at my clients' nursing home facilities the same as I did before I read this handbook!  I'm a healthcare attorney, not an architect. There are some chapters that are more applicable to my role with clients than others; nevertheless, I found this book extremely informative and thought provoking. Clearly this book was a labor of love for Ms. Nadel."
books,,5.0,Great read!,"Nora Roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance, mystery, action scenes, etc. and they are all present in this great read. I also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality. There's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims. The tension is high, and though I had some ideas, I did not figure out who the killer was until the very end."
books,,5.0,A great and compassionate guide through a tough experience,"I am a primary care physician and read this book with an eye toward recommending it to my patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer.  I found the book to be thorough, compassionate and very clearly written.  It's an unusual book.  As other reviewers have commented, breast cancer guides are either from MD breast cancer ""experts"" OR from patients.  This is the only book I am aware of written by someone who has lived both sides of this disease. I will recommend this book strongly to my patients with breast cancer, and also to their family members and friends.  Thanks to Dr. Kaelin and Ms. Coltrera for providing us with such a terrific resource"
books,2 of 14,5.0,And The Boys In The Band Played On,"The sexual revolution is over, wrote an old revolutionist named P.J. O'Rourke, and the microbes won.  This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war."

books,2 of 3,2.0,Wait for the Cliffs Notes,"This book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than I am.  But while I was reading, I kept asking myself, ""When's he going to get to the point?""  The first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something I thought was unnecessary.  The bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.  Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.   This was the only part of the book I was interested in.  To me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with ""fluff"".  However, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts.  I would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd.  I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise"
books,5 of 5,5.0,The Way It's SUPPOSED To Be Played,"If you haven't seen the show, go and do it.  If you have, well done."
books,2 of 5,5.0,Great Addition to the Genre,"Excellent story and artwork.  The author really put some thought into the plotline.  He did a great job of using the overall concept to examine other societal issues in a fresh way.  If you are a fan of the zombie genre at all, then you are sure to enjoy this book"
books,,4.0,There was no one like Heinlein -- ever!,"I suspect not many younger SF readers really ""get"" Heinlein. You really have to be an early-phase Baby Boomer, one of those (like me) who got hooked on his juveniles in the early `50s, when rolling roads and unlimited solar power and a working lunar colony seemed not only possible but very likely. Those ""Future History"" stories were the stuff of dreams for geeks of my generation. Personally, I had every intention of being the Staff Archaeologist on the first flight to Mars. Ah, well."
books,1 of 2,4.0,Unspeakable Horror/post traumatic stress,"This book worked for me. I was drawn into a life, a sad unremarkable life on the outside but a life filled with courage and dignity inside. Paco has a story so horrific, so painful that he can't share it with anyone but the dead who haunt him. He can't escape his experiences or his pain. He can't comprehend why he is still alive. He can't relate to those living ordinary lives. He cannot share his terrible story. He is going through the motions of living on the ""outside"" but really living to deal with his inner demons."
books,2 of 3,5.0,West tells the Truth,"This book contains absolutely one of the best explanations of the current Balkan fiasco.  While dwelling on Tito, West also explains the ethnic  disputes that have torn apart Yugoslavia.  West's coverage of the Ustasha  is particularly accurate and enlightening"
books,2 of 5,5.0,THIS BOOK IS THE PREGNANCY BIBLE!,"Ok, so there might be some parts that are negative, but really- how cool is it to tell your husband, partner, whatever that ""This week the ears will be growing and the baby will be able to start to hear things"" or ""The baby is now the size of a peanut- look at the scaled drawing in the book of what our baby looks like!""  I think that this is a great book.  Always take things with a grain of salt, but this book rocks.  I buy it for all my friends that are having babies.  Very informative, and the pics are really cool.  I thought this was the BEST book, way better that ""what to expect when you are expecting""  yuck!  :"

Peter offer lessons with the major chapters like 'Management's New Paradigms, Strategy, The New Certainties, The Change Leader, Information Challenges, Knowledge-Worker Productivity, and Managing Oneself for the new waves.

books,2 of 6,2.0,Disappointing,"I was never drawn into the story.  The writing and editing could have been better.  The distant narrator left me feeling uninvolved, and I never felt or cared anything for the characters.  For a well-written Vietnam story that draws the reader in, read The Proud Bastards"
books,9 of 9,5.0,"Creative, quirky , clear","I bought this book because other customers loved it and because it was not expensive. It was so much better than I expected. I was expecting to pick it up and just visually browse then leave it for later but read all the content the first day I had it -even reread parts incase I missed anything. I plan to use this with 17-18year olds within a design programme - as it is consise yet interesting. So: book is great value for money, practical advise offered is clearly presented and taught to the reader through its design! Visual content and extra information is compelling/quirky/humourous/relevant, overview of typographic evolution intereting and fonts useful. Loved the material used for the tables!....check it out."
books,18 of 19,5.0,A Must Have Book for People with Chronic Health Problems,"There are a number of books about Food Intolerances that are invaluable to people who have chronic health problems without knowing the cause of their problems.  Since physicians are often ignorant in the area of Type III or Delayed Onset Food Intolerance, these books are often the only hope for people to regain their good health and in many cases their lives.  Barbara Allen in her book Conquering Arthritis contributes detailed information to the topic that I have not seen in any other book.  Her own story is inspiring and her systematic approach to solving her personal health crisis mystery is a blueprint for others to find their personal way back to good health.  To her credit she did not only fight and win her own battle with ignorance, pain and deteriorating health but had the drive and compassion to get the message out there to help all of us with her excellent research and conclusions.  I was diagnosed with IBS and Fibromyalgia and Arthritis and Insomnia and Chronic Fatigue and CTS and was offered lots of prescription drugs, some of which I took for a while, but nothing helped like avoiding the foods to which I am allergic.  Barbara Allen made me aware of hidden additives in foods and vitamins that I needed to stop eating but that I would not have suspected.  Thanks for sharing, Barbara Allen!!"
books,2 of 4,4.0,"Great sequel, misleading title","Yet another fine effort from Stirling.  The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again.  A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed.  The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels."
books,,4.0,Better than Dance of Death,"I've read every Pendergast book, and Still Life with Crows is by far my favorite. So I tend to measure each book by Still Life. This book, while a lot better than the previous Dance of Death, still doesn't eclipse Still Life. However, it's good for what it is: a fairly predictable and formulaic Pendergast novel. But what's wrong with that? The formula is fun, Pendergast is an intriguing and neat character, and the expanding role of Constance Green is well worth a return trip to whatever Pendergast novel comes next"
books,6 of 12,4.0,Not your average night of theatre,"Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story."
books,7 of 7,4.0,So Basic to My Kitchen I Take It for Granted (Unfortunately),"I agree with everyone here, this book is comprehensive, easy to use, probably essential. I have the 1962 version that I inherited from my Mom.  I used to use it when I was a young girl, a teenager, a college student, all through my cooking upbringing. So I'm afraid I treat it like a well-worn pair of shoes, meaning that I mostly turn to sexier books for cooking inspiration--French gourmands, nouvelle superstars, vegetarian California mamas--but when I need the most basic of advice, the Joy of Cooking is always there, dependable, reliable, like Grandma waiting for you with a nice cup of tea and solid, sensible advice. Some of the recipes can be bizarre--I tried the recipe for those french doughnuts like I had in New Orleans, but the result was a strange concoction of boiled water and flour that you spoon into hot fat, nothing like the real thing--and others, like the muffin recipes, tend to be kind of blah.  But on the whole it's a dependable resource with a wide, almost encyclopedic, range. You can always have your flings with the sexier books, and after they break your heart JOC will still be there waiting for you with that cup of tea."
books,,4.0,hooked by chapter one; tear jerker in the end but worthy of a read,The emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable.  I found myself sobbing on more than one occasion.  Terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment.  I identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared
books,7 of 7,4.0,Powerful blend of history and mythology,"What sets Tim Powers above many others who write in the fantasy genre is his excellent grasp of both history and mythology, and the effortless way that he blends them together to create uniquely fascinating story lines. The Anubis Gates is a fine example of his genius. He combines history of early 19th century and late 17th century London with Egyptian mythology, binds it all together with time travel, and creates a fascinating and fast moving story. He skillfully introduces historical personages such as Lord Byron and Samuel Taylor Coleridge into his story, as well as asides referring to King George III and his madness, and Napoleon and his threatened invasion of England. He also creates an intriguing London underworld of bizarre  beggar's guilds and gypsy tribes. He then shows us this world through the eyes of a 20th century academic that is thrust into it almost by accident."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Grisham's Best,"""A Time to Kill"" is definitely Grisham's best novel.  It's interesting that it was Grusham's first novel, but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published.  The story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly.  Racism, murder, justice, revenge, law and order, etc.  The story will hold you from start to finish.  Most of Grisham's newer novels are simple, predictable stories that bash attorneys.  That is not the case with ""A Time to Kill"".  It will grip you, tear you and entertain you all at the same time"
books,4 of 4,5.0,"Very reflective, wonderfully descriptive and entertaining!",Loved it. Highly suggest it. Couldn't put it down
books,2 of 2,5.0,Diana Gabaldon Sucessfully Tackles A New Genre,"Gabaldon has built a huge fanbase on her Outlander series which spans literary genres from romance to science fiction to just about everything in between. Lord John Gray is a minor character in the seris, and never one of my favorites. When I heard that Gabaldon had written a mystery novel in which he takes center stage I read it more out of a sense of loyalty to the author than a genuine sense of interest in the character. I was surprised by how enjoyable I found it. Obviously the book is musch smaller in scope and size than the Outlander books (which average about 1000+ pages each) but Gabaldon establishes Lord John as a highly sympathetic caharacter in his own right, and tells a story almost completely separate from the series on which she made her name. Naturally this is jarring to readers initially, but going into the book with an open mind and no expectations yields rewards from a skilled novelis"
books,17 of 24,5.0,Masterful Work,"Bernard Bailyn's ""The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution"" is a truly masterful work. Bailyn gets to the heart of the radicalism of the American Revolution: a deep suspicion of government power, particularly centralizing power."
books,5 of 6,4.0,Second Time Around,Almost 20 years ago the initial edition of the WCE was a great advanbce in religious information and statistics. The second edition (now 2 volumes) reflects much of the change in the religious scene in the last 2 decades and that alone is worthwhile. What is interesting is that the projections made 20years ago for the year 2000 have often turned out to be 'spot on' and this adds to the value of the work. I commend this latest effort w/o reservation and look forward to updates more frequently. Religion is one of the things that everyone shares-we all have it. This book should be in every library-esp. religious ones.As a priest who follows and studies and interacts with this world I can recommend it most heartily
books,,5.0,Recommended,"Easy to read, clear and sensible advice given in response to 'real life' scarios and dog problems"
books,19 of 20,5.0,Hallelujah for Natural Progesterone and those who support it,"Thank you, Dr. Lee for your book! I was on a calculated plan of natural progesterone for approximately 8 months which corrected many of the issues brought on by synthetic progestogens. Contrary to what some people are writing in their reviews, natural progesterone is NOT the same as the synthetic progestogens found in birth control pills or RU-486, nor can natural progesterone be used at the same amount each month or forever. I, for one, CANNOT use synthetic progestogens because of the problems they cause--leg cramping, sleeplessness, mood changes, blood clots, weight gain to mention a few. Dosage of natural progesterone totally depends on physical, monthly needs of the individual woman-some months, a little more, some months, a little less, and always under the guidance of physicians who understand and support the use of natural progesterone. Hurray to those who bring this information to the forefront and are not slaves of the pharmaceutical companies"
books,1 of 1,1.0,Laughing all the way to the bank!!,"""Ha ha ha hah ha hah!""  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this ""Tolkein as faith"" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the ""thanks for the buck buddy"" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!"
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Well written, but be prepared for grim","Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen."
books,22 of 23,5.0,Shows why addiction is so widespread in society,"Due to the pressures of modern life, many people are addicts of one kind or another.Anne Schaef shows how society as a whole behaves in addictive ways.We usually think of an addict as being someone addicted to a drug, but there are many kinds of addiction.There are substance addictions, such as to alcohol, drugs, nicotine, caffeine and food.Everyday activities can become process addictions,such as accumulating money,gambling, sex,work,religion and worry.Personal relationships can also be addictive.Many politicians behave like addicts,as they are hooked on  control,  promising things will get better(but they do not)denying problems and denying alternative ways of doing things.This all adds up to the Addictive System which is modern society.Schaef concludes that &quot;we cannot allow anything to come between us and our spirituality, or between us and our living process.If we do, we shall destroy ourselves and those around us.&quot;This is a very worthwhile book, with penetrating insight into modern life"

Poor Henry Yewbeam, actually Charlie's great-granduncle, goes missing from the year 1916 and turns up in the present.  Charlie discovers his distant relative and the powerful Time Twister that allowed him to make his incredible journey.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take long before Manfred Bloor, his father, and grandfather pick up the trail.  Things get very complicated as Charlie keeps losing Henry while trying to figure out the riddle of the Time Twister."
books,,4.0,Babies with DownSyndrome,"I had recently found out that my future grandchild was diagnosed with Down Syndrome and was anzious to start educating myself. The book helped me understand the syndrome and realize that we need not be afraid of what the future holds. Since then I have found out that this baby will probably not go full term, but what I read made me realize that I should not be afraid of hearing Down Syndrome in the future."

books,6 of 6,4.0,"Good Crichton, not his best","Intriguing as always, exciting from the first page, strong for the first 2/3rds and less ""editorializing"" than usual, but it's just not as good as his higher concept novels. But it's still very enjoyable all the way through, and as always makes you think. It feels a little dated now, but I re-read it last week and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Sphere should definitely be a part of any Crichton fan's library. Skip the movie, though. Here, the science is less ""convincing"" than in Jurrassic Park (which is mostly convincing, but stretched) and Prey (which is better writing and fun, but not convincing). But that doesn't matter, because Crichton can write an adventure like few others (as long as character isn't important--character's here take backseat to concept and science). Pace, as always is good. More a rollicking adventure than ""something to think about"" (typical of later novels) and quite enjoyable on that level. It's the kind of novel you'll tear through in a weekend at most.  And that's a good thing"
books,4 of 4,1.0,STOP WITH THE ADJECTIVES DEAN!!!,"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale."

books,5 of 5,4.0,A book that provides &quot;real&quot; employee thought in fun work!,"I'm Donald Freeman, former General Manager of Operations for Sprint call center in Phoenix, AZ. (Read more about Don in Fish Tales by Charthouse).  This books is a must for anyone currently involved in bringing Fun into the workplace and a good book to place beside the book &quot;Fish&quot; by Charthouse.  I got real examples from companies and employees in this book that provided me with great ideas to use in my own business.  This book provides many detailed examples from companies who have found &quot;being productive is fun&quot;.  It provides real examples on how companies become a place where people care and where people count. The book demonstrates the importance of celebrations that are honest and really are celebrations of being happy!  She provides a lot of insight and their are shared ideas that can be used that have little cost but really make a difference in terms of caring and making work fun!  It gives feedback from individuals who found the value and success in bringing &quot;fun to work&quot;.  If anyone has been challenged with using the Fish philosophy as a tool for fun at work, this book may be the ticket for making it all come together"
books,7 of 11,4.0,An English Teacher's Perspective!,"Having taught this book several times as an English teacher, I've certainly had my exposure to it.  My view of the novel has certainly changed over time, as I've come to regard the novel for all of its beauty.  I strike a single star from its score simply because I don't believe the book has aged well; it is not accessible and applicable to contemporary America like it was to the generation of adolescents who could still remember that there was such a thing as World War II and that it wasn't almost as long ago as Noah's flood.  To today's teenagers, it comes across as cheesy.  This is truly a shame, suggesting we have reached a period in history in which the naivet� of youth has been obliterated.  But then, that is what the novel is about, and perhaps it has grown even more meaningful today.  Instead of reading this text as a commentary on individual maturation and the rites of passage associated with it, A Separate Peace must be viewed as a commentary on the development of Modern America, a country that has grown much like Gene, made mistakes like Gene, and has come to realize a state of experience and worldliness that is a far cry from its origins."

In this book, Kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians, as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals."

books,8 of 14,5.0,Cheers to Brooke Shields for this book!!!!!,"For anyone who has ever suffered from Postpartum Depression, this book is a must read. As a mom of an almost 2 year old, I too suffered from PPD. While reading all of the pregancy books, I skipped all the chapter about PPD and laughed out loud. Who would be depressed after wanting a child for so long and finally getting their wish. Was I in for a rude awakening! Brooke Shields book hit home. In it, she is both funny and honest about everything that happened to her, from her bouts with infertility through her pregnancy and PPD and afterwards when her sun came out. There is not enough emphasis on this subject. She tells of her struggles with infertility, miscarriages and her wonderful pregnancy. She didn't come off as a celebrity who has someone else caring after her child. She is a hands on mom who happened to have suffered from PPD. You can feel a connection and I am so happy for having read this book. Kudos, Brooke Shields"
books,1 of 1,5.0,"The Law was not about truth. It was about negotiation, amelioration and manipulation.","Michael Haller's life revolves around criminal defense, his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car. His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy, people either called him Mick or Mickey. Tall, dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch. In the court room he was very together with great timing, in his personal life it was a mess, at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter. His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to, his father wrote books and practised law that didn't have room for innocent clients, so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn't recognize innocence if it came along. Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll, he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn't afford to pay his fees. In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour, what he was really looking for was a franchise player, a case to keep the cash rolling, point blank a meal ticket."

books,4 of 5,1.0,Written like a bad movie,"I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like ""The gun was loaded, and so was I"".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list"
books,3 of 8,1.0,Why continue to be deceived...,"Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy ""experts"" or ""scholars"" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, ""The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea,"" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: ""The REAL Rapture"".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's ""The REAL Rapture"" (based on a volume in his forthcoming ""Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period"" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)"
books,,5.0,One of the most entertaining of Shakespeare's comedies.,"As with all of Shakespeare, the concept of love at first sight is given far too much credit, but other than that, this is a delightful romp filled with much amusement. The language is as beautiful as one expects in Shakespeare, but is somewhat less difficult for the modern reader to follow than in some of his plays; I found myself being more distracted than helped by most of the footnotes. As with most Shakespearean comedies, it was easy to see that this play was intended for the amusement of the common people; the similarities in style between the plot here and in much modern pop culture were striking (the sexual innuendo to be had when a woman passes for a man and finds another woman falling in love with her, for instance). If it had a flaw, it was that the ending was just a little TOO pat and contrived, even for a comedy, but that's just a minor quibble"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Unusual entry in the undead genre,"Animal physiologist Ed HARRIS receives an email from a scientist friend Tom urging him to come over to his university. Over there Tom shows him what he brought back from his latest field trip - an undead dog! The two scientists examine the poor creature and try to find out where it came from and how it got back from the dead. This introduction with the scientist's lab experiments and their subsequent investigation is a bit CSI like (e.g. they detect a .22 calibre bullet in the undead dog's skull and back trace it to a gun buff club). It turns out eventually that there are people, who have some strange supernatural ability (the Talent) to resurrect the dead. When the scientists present their findings at a conference of the National Society for Research Scientists they are met with disbelief, outrage and hostility by the scientific community, prompting Tom to commit suicide."
books,,5.0,"So, I finally finished it","Plainly put, this book was a ride. Standing back from a distance and looking at what the author has done really can put you in awe - the sheer scope of this work is breathtaking. He digs into many different scientific, mathematical, and artistic disciplines, and somehow manages to work them all together into a sometimes confusing, but ultimately satisfying whole."

books,4 of 4,4.0,excellent book,"I've seen some skeptical comments about Tom Brown's alleged Apache teacher, Stalking Wolf. All I can say is it doesn't really matter whether this book is biographical or a fictitious novel. It makes you think, which is the best any book can do. I've browsed Brown's Field Guides also but they do not show half the heart of ""Grandfather"". None of the ideas are earth-shatteringly new, but somehow Brown manages to radiate a real love for wilderness and a concern for where the modern world is headed, without resorting to the same old tree-hugger rants that are becoming background noise to most people today. His story rings true against ""Black Elk Speaks"" and ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"", and even if not based entirely on fact, hits the mark it is aimed at surely and squarely. Great read and I wish Brown would write more of those many stories about Grandfather that he claims to have"

Great detail is given to how the messages of western literature apply to life in the theocratic totalitarian state. The scariest thing, for me, is how closely the vision of Iran held by muslim extremists conforms to the stated vision of the U.S. held by christian extremists.  This touched me with reality the way The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood touched me with fictional possibility."

books,11 of 11,5.0,"Heinlein's 1st juvenile novel, basis for ""Desitination Moon""","This was Heinlein's first novel published in book form, and the first in his excellent ""juvenile"" series which included Space Cadet, Time For The Stars, Starman Jones, The Star Beast, Tunnel In The Sky, etc., and it is still my all-time favorite. Heinlein manages to make believable the tale of a scientist (Dr. Cargraves) organizing three 18-year-old boys of a rocket club to build a nuclear powered moon rocket. If you have an interest in space travel you'll get sucked in and won't put the book down until it's over, no matter how dated and unlikely the premise at first appears. It is written with Heinlein's usual skill (that earned him four Hugo awards), and the characters are easy to identify with, especially for any young space enthusiasts. This was also the basis for the 1950 classic film Destination Moon, although about all that remains unchanged in the film is the name Dr. Cargraves. In the book there is a veiled threat from unknown enemies that turn out to be Nazis (this was the first thing Heinlein wrote after the war) - in the film there's just a veiled reference to a communist threat. I suspect the film also draws from Heinlein's more sophisticated treatment from the same period, The Man Who Sold The Moon."

I love his style, his way with words, his storylines, dialogue, description, and masterful similes.  Another Conroy fan once e-mailed me, asking if I knew anyone else who wrote as well as Conroy.

books,2 of 2,5.0,About our continent in the days of THE RIFLEMEN . . .,"Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like.  It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the ""Rifle-text"", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the ""ages"" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad & twisted ""love story"" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah & Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, ""...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?""  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers & Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful & worthwhile), but here in the most ""modern"" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints & clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which ""voices"" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to & for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Good Prep Material,"No single book will prepare you for any certification exam and with what the CISSP exam costs you will want to make sure you are fully prepared. I found this book worth the money.  It's a good book to start you on the path to the CISSP exam or for a final review of the subject matter. It covers all the ten domains and unlike some books, which seem to read like stereo instructions, the language in the book was clear and understandable. So get yourself several texts to study for the exam and make sure this is one of them. You will have a good head start towards passing"
books,6 of 9,5.0,great basic reference,"This book is a good reference for breeders and enthusiasts.  It has the breed standards for all the AKC recognized breeds as of the publication date.  It also goes into basic dog care.  I would definitely recommend it to families still struggling with what breed to pick out.  Check out the book, talk with your veterinarian then go to a dog show and talk with breeders and trainers"
books,0 of 3,1.0,Poor hodgepodge of a book,"This poor hodgepodge of a book should have been structured to explicate the immigration policies of each European country, then describe the experiences of each country with its Islamic radicals (and their families).  Instead, there is just a spouting forth of this and that information in a way that does not help readers see which immigration measures are useful and which are negative.  The poor linkage of measures to experience deprives readers of any handle on how the European countries can improve the situation in the future."
books,2 of 3,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyable read,"I enjoyed every minute of this book.  This story of a woman's path to fulfillment, blended with just the right amount of history, kept me wondering what was factual and what was fiction.  The perfect book to take on a long car ride or plane trip"
books,2 of 2,4.0,It is magnificent,"Wow, what an epic."
books,0 of 4,1.0,This Song Best Left Unsung,The history of the book when it was published tells it all. After a media blitz and great anticipation with what would be written - due to Brando pocketing an absolutely huge advance - the sales were so abysmal that it was discounted by fifty-percent or more less than two weeks after sitting mostly unsold on store shelves.
books,1 of 1,5.0,Aces on the update!,"This update is aces!  The added information on pregnancy/lactation safety came just in time (I had just started the L&D rotation).  The Quick Look-up feature is very helpful!  Overall, this Drug Guide is a MUST for nursing students and licensed nurses"
books,4 of 4,2.0,a long book that seems to get longer as you read it,"The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness"

books,1 of 5,4.0,Another great one....But not worth 5 stars,"Mr. Stirling has succeded again.  Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read.  Honestly, I don't know where to start when explaining how good it is, so I will let you know the one thing I found highly disappointing about it, in one word:"
books,23 of 23,5.0,The Great Garner Strikes Another Blow for Good Prose,"Bryan A. Garner is leading what might be a Quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear, clean, unambiguous and even interesting prose.  This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage.  The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong.  He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it.  If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn't get to a judge.  They'd likely settle.  And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were &quot;traditionally drafted.&quot;  And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause.  That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople.  The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language.  Legal writing is written in English, the same English used to buy groceries, talk lovingly to your spouse, and complain to the doctor about what ails you.  There is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson, other than lawyers' need to feel like they're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana.  And the writer's praise of &quot;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary&quot; as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement:  &quot;DESPITE anything in this agreement to the contrary . . . .&quot;  Garner is a brilliant, insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use.  We know what happens with legalese:  litigation and contention and noncomprehension.  Give plain English a try, with Garner as your guide to Aquinas's trinity of wholeness, harmony, radiance, and of course clarity clarity clarity"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A wonderful book,"Daring to Dream is the first story in the Dream Trilogy.  It focuses on Margo Sullivan, the daughter of the Templeton's housekeeper.  Margo's best friends are her two ""sisters"" whose stories are told in the other books.  Margo is beautiful and has always had plans to see the world and be famous."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Beautiful book!,This book was really touching.  The photos are beautiful and most of the dogs you can just feel their soul and personality right through the pages.
books,0 of 4,2.0,attention to detail sometimes a distraction,"As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre.  The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction.  Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink?  And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice.  (Do they even make it anymore?  I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist).   And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames.  You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed ""Smiley"" Jones if you never mention ""Smiley"" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname.  That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned)"
books,7 of 9,5.0,I loved this book,Find out what it means when someone turns their back to you while you are talking to them. Find out what it means when someone walks near the door when you are talking to them. Find out what it means when someone picks something up and puts it between you and them while you are talking to them. Find out the hidden meanings. Highly recommended.  Full of lots of useful information that each and everyone can benefit from
books,2 of 7,1.0,"A Big, Vague, Bundle of Contradictions","In this book's intro it says, ""It's no coincidence you opened this book"" then ""You see, everytime a coincidence occurs, a prayer is answered, or something happens to make you say, 'Wow! What are the odds of that happening?' You've received a godwink, a signpost along the path to your destiny-a message of reassurance that you are never alone."""
books,,5.0,The Secret Life of Bees,The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.

books,1 of 1,5.0,This One's Special,"A beautiful book, excellent for a gift as well as for one's own library.  The illustrations are many, varied, and lovely.  The text is engrossing"
books,,5.0,Masterpiece,"I had never heard of R.A Salvatore before i picked up ""Homeland"", instantly within a few pages of reading i was hooked on what was the best Trilogy of books i have read since ""The Lord fo the Rings"", in my own opinion.  He managed to captivate my mind by exploring a world of complete darkness, but with such intricate detail i sometimes forgot that i had been reading for a few hours.  Its a great story about finding your own path in life no matter who stands in your way.  A story about love, even if its completely useless where you come from.  Drizzt Do'Urden is character that will forever live within, and prove what a true author can do"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Seeing Double?,"Dr. Maura Isles is very surprised that there are a couple of obstacles that are linked to her throughout the book.  Some of the different events and some of the different adversities through the book were strikingly familiar to her ownself. She has been on edge ever since some problems through the book.  If you would like an exciting, and would like a book that establishes many different adventures for Maura Isles, this is the book for oyu to read"
books,12 of 13,4.0,Helps you establish realistic expectations.. and that's a lot,"There are a lot of books out there that try to tell you how to make money in the stock market.  This one accomplishes something else.  By giving quite a bit of history of market performance and explaining why stocks performed as they did over multiple time periods, Siegel gives the reader a basis for understanding how and why stocks respond to different inputs."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Page turner until the end!,"This was a fantastic book.  It really made me think about the politics of organ donation and the hardship of having a child with a terminal illness.  The story is told from the perspective of each family member as well as the lawyer representing the well sister/organ donor.  I really felt compelled to side with the well sister, but as a parent I could empathize with the parents as well.  This book will keep you up late until it's finished...a great read"
books,0 of 1,1.0,"A so-so book, but there are better","This book is great for a first time owner looking to learn about parrots in general and specifically about african grey parrots. It devotes a nice introduction and touches on most toopics that are important in a manner that is easy to digest for the common human. However, I feel that the book falls short on several aspects, and I found myself wanting to know more after the last sentence in each section. I thought I would leave it as just a reference manual but the book in itself is poorly cross referenced and does not even have an index! As such, the book is merely a pamphlet or guide about african grey parrots. For the ~$20 that it costs you can find the same information in much less expensive books that actually have an index. Having some experience with other parrots and with other books, I find the book lacking and plain."
books,5 of 8,2.0,Story after story...,"There are a few interesting nuggest in the first few pages and then story, after story, after story.  There's no doubt that their agency is successful but please present some principles and not story, after story, after story.."
books,5 of 7,4.0,Good book!,I agree wholeheartedly with the excess and the overconsumption that is the main theme of this book. I also agree with the lack of free time and the toll that working longer is having on our mental and physical health. I am sick of the suburban sprawl around me and the rapid rate that every piece of green open space is getting concreted over. Overconsumption is killing us.
books,,4.0,A New Office Ritual,"When I started work at my present job almost two years ago, I found that the place needed a little 'lightening up'.  It was casual already, to some extent, so on my next 'office supply' shopping 'trip'  I picked up this calendar for my desk.  Well, it began a new office ritual; everyone wants to know the &quot;Far-Side-of-the-day&quot;!  Sometimes, it's the only funny thing to happen all day.  Larson needs to come out of retirement"
books,4 of 5,5.0,"""You are there....""","I had never heard about this case so I didn't know what to expect when I started the book.  It immediately had a ""you are there"" ring to it because of the easy flow and the details and descriptions.  It read like a novel.  This is such a sad story, especially for the children.  How sick does a man have to be before somebody notices and does something about it?  Do these psychopathic men really hide their evil so well?  I can think of Scott Peterson, of course, and Laurie Hacking's husband, as well as others -- and David Brame fits right in with them.  Nobody notices the sickness in these men until it is all over and their wives are dead?  It is so sad.  In any case, this was a very well-written book and I am going to check to see if Paul LaRosa has written any others"
books,4 of 4,5.0,"A CONCISE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, BLUNT WARNING","Like most reviewers, I found this brief book to be a highly believable warning of the coming huge depression. How can you argue with a thesis that accounts for the US economy's ups and downs in detail for nearly a century!! Unlike the few, (like Special K below), who completely miss the key message, IT IS DEMOGRAPHICS that controls everything. Any economist will tell you that 70% of GDP is simply us (we are the demographics) spending our paychecks and, as Arnold points out, it's more like 90% when we add the government's spending of our taxes which they take from our paychecks. Arnold's thesis is a better developed version of noted economist Dent's theory that specific demographics always control where the economy is going. It's not really theory anymore - it's plain commonsense, which is what comes out in Arnold's book. Dent also predicts a massive ""Mother of all Depressions"" starting around 2010. Special K and his ilk, who are quite happy I'm sure to (correctly) attribute the coming Social Security crisis solely to demographics but want to insist that the economy in general cannot possibly be, are the ones that are going to lose everything in what's coming. Go read Arnold to understand (concisely WITHOUT 200 extra pages of added irrelevant ""fluff"") that demographics is really all that counts - and why. My God, he even shows how the Japanese near depression from 1990 to 2003 was caused by exactly the same demographic data within Japan. What more do you want? Read it"

books,4 of 4,5.0,This might be the best happiness book,"I have written three happiness books in Finnish. Thus I know how hard it is to write something which is not too simple or too difficult. There are many books that promise too much, but this is not one of them. What I especially like is the tight story. Everything hangs nicely together. I am able to compare the books written by academic psychologists, because I have all the major happiness books. This is really on top. It covers the major areas, is very well written and does not promise too much. I want to warn you about the books whose title is something like ""Happiness now"" or ""How to be happy"". It is extremely difficult to raise your happiness level"
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Pleasent Surprise - you should read this book,"I am white, grew up in a small Ohio town with no blacks, went in the Marine Corp, my first exposure to the black community you might say then spent a couple decades in Corporate America as our country has moved along from the sixties and the appropriate black activities of the time. I have to say this book is a pleasent surprise. It has no big discussion on the whites that cause all their problems, it is just a downright honest book about one life lived well. Sometimes Tavis arrogance comes through and I imagine there are those along the way that would have some say about that but it doesnt matter. This book outlines a black success story against incredible odds but more importantly it is an American success story. You can all learn alot about growing up black and growing up impoverished in America as I did from this. More importantly Tavis outlines how we can forgive and love one another which is most important."
books,2 of 4,5.0,Thinking is Required,"This is a great book, but you have to read it with the idea in mind that it was something like a million years ago when it was written. (ok maybe not that long ago) I have this in my library because it is an essential piece for any person who - like me - want to venture out in the unknown waters of (gasp)AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH - self employment. Gotta think everyday and while your at it - read this too. Use your common sense of course but READ IT"

books,3 of 3,5.0,The Love And Devotion,"I love the runaway bunny and my kids love the runaway bunny. It makes us laugh, brings us closer together, and helps reinforce the most important lesson my children can learn ""A Mother's Love has no limits."" We laughed at the young bunny's frustration, marveled at the mother bunny's persistence, and discussed the love and commitment that strengthens our own family. The Runaway Bunny has been a useful tool in reinforcing my dedication to my children.As young children enjoyed the pictures.It's small and simple, but the lesson is profound"
books,5 of 9,1.0,"Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst","Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring."
books,13 of 14,5.0,If you like words - WOW!,"Ciardi was a mind-bogglingly brilliant man.  This comes across in this book.  When I want to learn about any subject, I start with the words and their etymologies.  I use this book as one of my references.  Example:  Albania - why is it called that?  I find that 'alb' means 'white', so it tells me that the country has snow covered mountains.  Then, no wonder the white of the egg is called 'albumen', the alps are called such, and the word 'album' means 'white tablet', or an albino is an albino. I guess an albatross must be white.  Looking into word histories tells you about all sorts of things.  Ciardi must have been working indefatigably on this subject, like Pliny and some of those other guys who did so much work for all of us"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Untying the Alexandrian knot,This is a fantastic book! 112 pages of theory and advice that really makes sense. You easily internalize the message! This is then followed by 5 VERY thorough and down to the detailed examples of how the theory has been practised by fore running companies in the field of 3rd world integration. It is very illustrative and initiate thoughts on how this could be followed up in your own compan
books,19 of 20,5.0,The Best Room Makover Book,Once in a while a book has a great impact on your life and Use What You Have Decorating is one of those books for me. My house looks like I brought in an expensive decorator but I did it myself just from what I learned by reading it.
books,,5.0,To Savor Slowly,The perfect book to have an adventure with your mind. You travel in this book has you would by closing your eyes and point a finger on a map to see where to go on your next trip. Totally random safe dates with yourself. I keep this book close at hand for the moments when I think I need a little stimulation. Highly recommended.
books,2 of 2,4.0,Mystic River,"Dennis Lehane's Mystic River is a suspenseful, mind-teasing thriller that keeps the reader geussing and wanting to read more.  One of three friends gets kidnapped and molested as a child, but manages to escape four days later.  Twenty-five years after that, the friends have grown apart, and one of the men's daughters has been mysteriously murdered.  This tragic event brings the three boys back together again and shows that the past can never be hidden or forgotten.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to be kept geussing with a suspenseful murder mystery"

If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Good Read,"The Husband was a good read; nothing over the top, just a straight forward suspense novel. Dean Koontz is always an enjoyable read."
books,7 of 22,4.0,Commanding success with typos,"While I have not finished the entire book, I find it ironic that in a book on success and accomplishment there are at least 1 or 2 typographical errors in each chapter.  While the business concepts appear sound, I am concerned about the lack of editing that apparently went into this book.  I have also read Automatic Wealth by this author and there were few if any typos"
books,5 of 6,5.0,No Straw Man Here,"Henry Allison has become one of the world's best living Kant Scholars, and KTI is his best work. With Kantian epistemology becoming more and more important, not to mention controversial, many of Kant's critics have got in the habit of smashing down straw-man versions of Kant (often without even realizing it). Here however, Allison weaves together a stunning interpretation and defense of Kant's Transcendental Idealism that leaves little room for those wanting to flail away at poorer constructions. For anyone who loves Kant this is the book for you, and for those who don't this is one of the most important books you'll ever read because it really lets you know what you're up against"
books,4 of 4,1.0,Al Deserved Better Than This Shoddy Book,"I had been meaning to read this long-overdue biography of Alan Shepard, and I happened to pick it up in a cruise ship library.  As I read it I was surprised at the number of factual inaccuracies--there is at least one glaring non-technical error per chapter, which calls into question almost everything else between the covers.  Numerous reviews here mention more problems with technical aspects of the book that I was unaware of, but which do not surprise me given the apparent lack of proofreading and fact-checking."
books,,5.0,Easy to follow recommendations,"It is interesting that out of the many books that I have read this one does not hit me across the head. However with that said, I re-looked at the book before writing this note and I did mark a lot of text that I found highly useful. I particularly liked the solid recommendations for implementing personal and community change at the end of each chapter. Maybe the fact that the authors do not try wow you with their brilliance but provide solid and easy to follow recommendations is why this book is so valuable. The structure also lends itself to a study group within your management team helping to drive implementation of the principles introduced."

books,5 of 5,5.0,An excellent book,"I have read all of the circle books, actually all of Tamora Pierce's books. This is defintely a good one. It is for an older audience which was excellent for me. (I started reading these books when I was 12 and am now 19) With this book you find out so many new things about the 4 of them. You really get to know their personalities more and who they are as adults. You now see them grow from children to young adults and all they have seen in their short life. It is amusing how they can show up the most experienced mages in the world. All because they work together, so this also is a good lesson for children, even though this book has more adult content in it than the other ones. But if you have read the other 8 books in the series you will love this book. The only frusterating part is how they won't let the other ones in their lives in the begining but of course everything works out. All in all read this book, you will love it! I only hope she writes more about the 4 mages"

books,5 of 31,2.0,Not far enough,"The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer."

books,0 of 1,4.0,Fairly good,At the beginning when the book tells us about Saddam Hussein I thought that this'll be as many books written about him. When the book turns out to be an internal affair is when you get thrilled. The book has some pages that said nothing about the main plot but you'll get hooked till the end. This is my first book by VF and I'm looking forward to read more of him.

Based out of the University of Chicago, this Nobel Prize winner in Economics has consistently and cogently argued for the benefits of capitalism over any other form of economic organization.  This, along with ""Free to Choose"" are his two major works establishing and explaining his beliefs.  Within it, he argues against many established policies in the US federal government such as the minimum wage, subsidies, rent controls, and licensing requirements for practice in fields such as medicine and law.  Likewise, he argues for many market-orientated alternatives to today's arrangements, such as increasing the use of school vouchers."

books,9 of 9,4.0,"Less About Baker Himself, Of Course, Than American Politics","I did not know a great deal about James Baker before I read this book, but I mean it as a compliment to the clarity of his reminiscences when I say I think I do now. In the field of political autobiography, it is not always the case that one emerges knowing more about the author and subject than when one began. From the pages of his book I discern that James Baker is not without wit, albeit at times a distinctly biting one. He is also less a statesman than a politician, and less a politician than a man with protective loyalty to his friends. He is perhaps above all someone with a talent for inserting himself into a situation and calling on a lifetime's worth of well-placed contacts when there is a need to get things done. In short, to his party and to its inner circle, Mr. Baker is invaluable."
books,1 of 2,4.0,"Fun, funny, funnier...","This little gem of a book will have you chuckling outloud.  Based on his life, author Jean Shepherd spins yarns of past loves, family vacations, top playing, and the awkwardness of growing up in a less-than-privileged part of town.  You will connect with some stories, shake your head at others, and burst out laughing at most"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Wow!,"What a great book!  420 pages, hardback, and every single page is worth reading, not one page is boring.  You just want to keep reading and keep turning pages!"
books,21 of 29,5.0,Greatest book of the 20th century,Quite simply the most important book of the twentieth century for several reasons:
books,6 of 6,4.0,Hiaasen Continues to Impress,"I just finished reading Strip Tease by Carl Hiaasen. I found his writing to be typical Hiaasen which is to say it is unexpected, sarcastic and witty. In this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past."
books,,4.0,Trying to finnish,"When I heard Nora had written another trilogy, I was excited. Normally I can't wait to finnish them. However, I have only managed to get about halfway through this book. I found it hard to from the past to the present, and vampires just aren't my thing I suppose. Knowing me, I'll leave this for a couple months, then try to read it again."
books,16 of 19,1.0,Needs a footnote,"Ralph Ketcham certainly some respect I had for him when he, in the middle of Patrick Henry's speech, inserted, ""Here Mr. Henry strongly and pathetically expatiated on the probability of the president's enslaving America..."""
books,8 of 10,4.0,Thought provoking and interesting,"I liked this book although I suspect it will get very mixed reviews.  Diamond gives examples from history of different societies' reactions to environmental problems, including societies that have succeeded and those that have failed.  Then he makes comparisons to contemporary society."
books,0 of 3,1.0,Contemptible,"Farb's basic premise is that American Indians have ascended to the heights of culture (read: white culture) by 400 years of systematic genocide.  That's what the book boils down to.  Farb also makes numerous factual errors; e.g., he says the Mandan Indians are exitinct; umm, no, Mr. Farb, they're not"
books,3 of 3,5.0,"Good advice, and very readable","First and foremost, Tobias has a keen sense of humor, which makes this book an enjoyment to read.  In my opinion that is the most important thing because if a book is dull albeit with good advice, then you're probably not going to get much from it.  The real-world examples and down-to-earth suggestions make this something for everyone, not just the wealthy.  This was the first investment book that I had ever purchased.  And although it isn't the only one I own, it's the one I refer to most often.  I've never taken a business class, and my career is completely unrelated, but I needed something to help me plan my finances.  I learned an extraordinary about from Tobias and I definitely feel confident going into the investment world."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent!,"This is the first book I've read by Greg Iles. However, it will not be the last! This book handled some very complicated issues along with all the tangents that come with those issues."
books,,5.0,A wonderful resource,"Like Steven Gilbar's ""The Book Book"" (see my review), this is a great item to just pick up and open; you're sure to find something interesting in it no matter what page you choose.  Though not marketed as such, it will prove most interesting to parents of children from grade-school through high-school age, and may indeed be used as a compendium of reading lists by homeschoolers.  Besides allusions, quotations, and definitions, the bulk of the book, as with Gilbar, is given over to lists of books--everything from ""Best-Selling Books"" to ""1990s Literature From Around the World;"" there's no reason an intelligent teen can't take a taste of everything Strouf lists.  Serious-minded ones may also want to check out List #9 (""Influential Writers from Around the World""), #14 (""Literary Criticism""), and #16 (""U.S./British/Irish Critics"") for ideas on where to go next.  But above all, buy it for Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (Books...for All Ages, Genres...for Every Taste, Drama, Themes, and Literary Periods) and the titles and authors in Section 4 (Poetry).  It's true that there are a few rather glaring typos that would have been caught by an editor who knew his books, but by searching under both author and title you should still be able to find all the items listed.  Then get yourself a used copy of Gilbar (get his ""Great Books"" too) and ""The Prentice-Hall Good Reading Guide,"" and you'll have a treasure trove worthy of the fabled Indies to search and sample"
books,,5.0,GREAT BOOK!  GOOD SUMMER READ!,"I really enjoyed this book by Nora Roberts.  It is set in the Carribbean which makes it a good book to read in summer, IMHO.  It has romance, treasure hunting, and a little magic....really great!  I liked it alot"
books,4 of 6,5.0,Another Good Book,"I found this to be another good book by the author. His eye-opening first book ""When God Winks"" was truly exceptional and this book is close to living up to that standard. His thoughts on love and relationships are insightful. This is a very good book"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Deception Point was a Page-Turner...,"I first read Angels and Demons, after my Mother recommended it to me; last summer.  Dan Brown's style of writing took me a bit to get use to. After that I complete enjoyed the book.  I promptly went out and bought the Da Vinci Code, Digital Fortress, and Deception Point.  I next read the Da Vinci Code, which I finished just before the movie came out (took me some time as I was working and going to college 3 nights a week).  I picked up Digital Fortress 2 weeks ago and finished it last Sunday (app. 1 week).  Once again a great read.  Then I picked up Deception Point..."
books,33 of 33,5.0,My favorite training book,"I purchased this book when I unexpectedly had a new german shorthair puppy to train. I purchased it because it had an extensive section on puppy training and I was anxious to get started. I also soon purchased several other bird dog training books, including some very famous ones, but I kept coming back to Larry Muellers book. I like his attitude toward dogs and his willingness to go against commonly held beliefs and techniques. He is a very obsevant man who incorporates the latest dog psychology into his obsevations. The emphasis is on avoiding mistakes or techniques which cause setbacks and cost you time to correct. This gives you a lot of insight into dogs minds and training in general. Most importantly every technique he recommended WORKED! I cannot say that about any of the other books. Also every thing that he said to avoid that I did not manage to avoid cost me time. He was right. I have repeatedly received compliments on my dogs performance and manners even by pros. The biggest factor in that was this book. This is an excellent book to purchase before acquiring a pup. His puppy training section(2-4months old) is extensive, excellent and effective. He also has techniques for selecting a pup which make a lot of sense"
books,,5.0,Classic Tale,"This is a jam packed, full of adventure, page turning, funny, mysterious, story of how Peter Pan came to be. I found myself reading this book over a weekend because I could not put it down. I was anxious to see which adventures would take place throughout the chapters!! I'm not normally a fantasy reader but with this years YRCA (Young Reader Choice Award) I'm beginning to take a liking for this type of writing."
books,6 of 6,4.0,Beautifully Written,"Those of us who have a story to share should do so, and this story is beautifully written; WHAT REMAINS is a unique one, worth telling, and would be even if it did not involve America's single most famous family. The details Carole Radziwill reveals are intimate, yet never give away more than those connected and still living would find intrusive. At times her pain is almost palpable, and she seems still slightly bewildered about her life and the tragic turn it took during the summer of 1999. The very fact that she did live it and came through it gives her every right to tell about it, and I am glad she chose to do so."
books,2 of 4,1.0,WHAT WAS WITH THE ENDING??!!!???!?!!!!!!??????,"It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing."
books,1 of 2,5.0,A fascinating look into the inner workings of a fascinating man,"If you've watched M. Night Shyamalan's films and never experienced a sense of deep, soulful emotion and a desire to know the man behind it, stop reading this review now, because this book is not for you.  But if, like me, you've been curious about the director with such an intriguing name, boyish good looks, and some truly amazing cinematic moments, then read on, as this book will quench your thirst for knowledge about the enigmatic M. Night Shyamalan."
books,2 of 3,4.0,Not bad,"There is certainly some good stuff in this book, but it wasn't as good as I hoped"
books,8 of 9,5.0,Must all literature be a mad rush to a formulaic conclusion,"Many readers of 'Waiting for Godot' obsess about the identity of Godot and whether he represents God or any other almighty being. It is unlikely that Beckett was referring to God as the man for whom the characters are waiting, as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in Beckett's theatre."
books,,4.0,You Get What You Pay,"Quite honest book and matches with any beginner's expectation. CD works really fine illustrating each and every example. Should the reader classify himself as a Photo Shop regular user, Scott Kelby ""The photoshop CS2 book"" will be more aggressive"
books,1 of 4,5.0,"A very funny, refreshingly honest, well-written tale of new motherhood.","Any adult can relate to the core story: How does one resolve a decision your heart knows is right, but which threatens the rest of your being? Here, Brett knows having a husband, child, and family was the right choice, but she'd like a second opinion. What follows is a story of a woman searching for the answer she knows it out there. The answer that is, ""yes. Yes. Yes!"""
books,5 of 26,1.0,P.O.S.,"Tipler says many times ""as I have proved"".  Huh? What the f is he talking about?  There is no proof in this stinking pile of filth.  He's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-I'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense, but I don't think it should matter.  I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense.  His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time.  The more books you read, the sooner you know when to stop reading, put the book down, and read a work of fiction instead, which can play with such ideas without boring you to death"
books,,5.0,How  David Slew the giant Goliath or America!,"Again, I read this book for insight into the ferocity of the Asian warriors in modern times since the Book of Revelation prophesies of a gaint world war III with Asia in the Tribuation from which we are not far."
books,0 of 2,1.0,Barely Relevant,"Mr. Ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career: he is an Ivy-league grad.  While I found some of his insights to be helpful, he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings.  While he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his working-class roots, Mr. Ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page, writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club. Caddying at a country club is not a degrading, confidence-busting job for a kid, working as a cashier at CVS is.  How does the CVS kid network his way out?"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Worth reading and Saving !,"This is one of the books that I will keep and re-read.  Very well written and inspiring.  I LOVED IT !! Made me ""want"" to write and made me feel that I could actually write something worth reading"
books,5 of 5,2.0,This books sucks,"When is everyone going to learn - there is no such thing as a how-to-get-rich book.  The title for the book is a joke itself.  Trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title.  Seriously, if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich, why would he tell you?  This book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of The Apprentice.  There is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality!  The advice is so mundane.  Half of the book is memoirs of a week as Trump - boooring.  And I don't want to read about the show in the last chapter.  I cannot believe this book was published.  The writing stinks and there is even some typos.  Trump may produce quality buildings, but that cannot be said of his books"
books,0 of 1,5.0,The Far Side always cracks me up,"How Gary Larson keeps coming up with this stuff I have no idea.  It seems like the more I read, the more I begin to laugh.  This particular Gallery is totally hilarious.  If you don't get the humor in ""The Far Side"", my guess is your brain is wired for something different than reading books. In fact, I heard the current President hasn't got a Far Side chuckle since 1991."
books,17 of 21,2.0,Big messy jumble of ideas,Mr Silber must indeed be very good at self-promotion: he obviously got all his friends and extended family to write great reviews about this mediocre book.
books,2 of 4,5.0,Planet of the Blind Illuminates,This is one of the best books I have ever read that captures the experience of visual impairment.  It is beautifully written and very evocative.  It will move those who are not visually impaired as well
books,4 of 4,4.0,Those who can sometimes teach...,"Another leader of an iconic ""green company"", Jeffrey Hollender - founder and CEO of Seventh Generation (yes, I use their laundry detergent exclusively) discusses the challenges of running a business with high integrity and full disclosure. In particular, Hollender recounts Seventh Generation's stint as a publicly traded company and posits that public ownership inevitably leads to an erosion of core values by the pressures of the markets. He cites also the example of Ben and Jerry's take-over by Unilever. I personally believe that positive social change can be wrought through the public securities markets and that values driven investing is the most significant tool available."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Modern Classic,"When I was growing up I devoured any book written about baseball.  As I've gotten older, my passion for the game has waned.  Though still a fan, I'd not read a baseball book in several years until I finally got around to reading this one."
books,,5.0,Series of Unfortunate Events Book 5 review,Series of Unfortunate Events Book #5 The Austere Academy
books,4 of 6,5.0,Exactly the kind of book to read if you fear for partner's ex,"This is an adorable book of evidence that would make anyone afraid of their partner's previous relationships, especially if the past boyfriends, girlfriends, and most of all ... spouses are still alive and kicking."
books,,5.0,P egasus Descending,"James Lee Burke! Anything written by him is a joy to read, but I especially love his Robicheaux novels. This one is no exception. I anxiously await his future novels. His writing is pure poetry. I recommend all of his books; try to read the Robicheaux novels in order. You won't be sorry for the money or time spent on Burke's books"
books,,5.0,A VERY NICE FOLLOW UP - GOOD READING,"Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all.  The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series.  My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them.  Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time.  This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues.  I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly."
books,,5.0,I love this book,"I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books.  The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing.  I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia.  You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Must Buy!,"Creative or not, this is one of the best books you'll ever buy to help you discover how to get the world to stand up and take notice. It's contemporary, no-nonsense, and filled with tons of suggestions on how to promote yourself or your business. For me, the added bonus were the ""mini-interviews"" sprinkled throughout-- not only were they interesting, but they gave up lots of anecdotes and nuggets of wisdom from people who have successfully ""been there and done that."" Half practical advice, half motivational tour de force-- this tiny little book will send you through several yellow highlighter pens! I highly recommend it, you won't regret the purchase"
books,1 of 1,4.0,"A strange, yet interesting journey","I bought this audio book based on a recommendation.  I knew very little about  it when I bought it and started listening to it.  I found it fascinating, although a bit repetitive.  The core concepts were for the most part engaging, and I like that it was read by the author.  I was surprised by the Q&A format, but got used to it fairly quickly. I find the background of the author very interesting"
books,,5.0,Maximum Ride School is Out Forever,"I purchsed this book, as well as Maximum Ride Angel Experiment. I read them both before giving them to my children to read. I found them to be ""clean"" of sex,language and violence. We all throughly enjoyed them and would recommend them to any child who likes fantasy and drama"
books,50 of 52,5.0,Essential for  Anyone Looking to Prevent Chronic Disease,"The author writes with zeal about the ""new medicine"" - vegan diet.  Full of references and detail, this is a solid discussion of how chronic disease can be prevented (and managed/reveresed) with diet.  As a vegan for over 3 years and a Registered Nurse, I thought I knew it all, but this book proved me wrong.  Your average physician is going to do one thing, wait until you have disease and then prescribe medication or surgery to ""manage it.""  You can do better.  Take matters into your own hands and read this book!  Highly recommended"
books,,5.0,Mean and lean and probably lost on the masses,"I realize this is an old title, I've not had a chance to get to all of the back list, I only first read Hiaasen a couple years ago."
books,4 of 5,2.0,Not Great,"I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book.  It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his &quot;executive success in the face of adversity.&quot; And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is  like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of  time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized  and a bad judge of character.  In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill  into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been  disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that  Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend  Lincoln On Leadership"
books,15 of 15,5.0,As valuable as an Education Savings Account,"This dictionary is indispensable for developing young minds who inquire at every turn, ""What does ..... mean?"" The beautifully illustrated, glossy cover advises that the contents include 32,000 entries and over 3,000 illustrations; this makes it a great vocabulary resource as well as being down right entertaining for kids. The pictures and illustrations are vividly colored, natural, not cartoonish, and very attractive."
books,15 of 15,5.0,Inspiring Must Read!!!!,"What I Know for Sure is that Tavis Smiley's testimony and transparency through this book was a refreshing read.  He is a prolific speaker and a voice for this generation. I applaud him for allowing us to share intimately into his life. I was deeply moved by his honesty in retelling the experiences that shaped the man we now see today. The candidness expressed in each chapter allowed us to witness the forces that birth his purpose and propelled his drive, ambition, and advocacy. His love for people was greatly evident. This book is a must read not just for African-Americans but for anyone who has faced adversity, challenges and trying circumstances in life.  Greatly inspiring"
books,6 of 6,5.0,An Important and All Too Timely Book,"After reading an editorial in the Washington Post written by this author concerning the Taliban's treatment of women, I had to read this book.  This is truly an important and timely book that touches on everything that vexes our society today - women's rights, where men fit into the modern society, racism, and how religion has played an unfortunate part in keeping women down, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  It is a dense and challenging, but worthwhile read.  And when you get your copy, pass it around.  It should be shared.  PS. Someone should tell Bill Maher about this one.  It's right up his alley"
books,1 of 13,1.0,A highly agrivating pile of schlock,"Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with ""All the Pretty Horses."" Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought ""What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."""
books,1 of 4,4.0,Raw  Power,"Professor Evans is writing a comprehensive three-volume history of Hitler's Germany, with this the middle book. The scope of the undertaking is daunting to the casual reader, with many topics taken to extreme lengths. For example, how average German citizens were organized for holidays and relaxation in the 1930s takes up many pages. However, a good book for the person with keen interest in the political, economic and social life of Germany in the critical years preceding WW II."
books,1 of 1,5.0,a must have for the dog owner or considering to be owner,"Kathy Santo's book is sure to be a helpful aid to anyone with a dog and if you're considering adding that adorable puppy to your family, bring the book home first! The book is written clearly & with some humor and the child that says ""Please can we have a dog,I'll take care of it"" will gain much knowledge from this book as well."
books,4 of 4,4.0,"Clear, concise and almost perfect","This is an excellent look at Ashtanga Yoga. Swenson uses good descriptions of the asanas and the vinyasas that link them and his analogies are a creative look at Yoga: Standing Series and Finishing series as bread slices in a sandwich, with the Primary Series as the filling in the sandwich; and the idea of a vinyasa as the ""etch a sketch"" which clears the slate for each new asana, and his ""physics of flight"" and ""ground transportation"" as a means to jumping forward. My only wish for the book would be that it would contain a fold-out page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page. It would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down. Also, (Ok, I have one more wish)I appreciated the break down of the Sanskrit word into meanings, but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too. Otherwise, it is nearly perfect"
books,2 of 3,2.0,DISAPPOINTING,"I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Run a lean mean operation,"Anyone who is well-versed in running a business will know what his or her costs are and where those costs can be reduced if need be. This is a wonderful book that lists 181 ways to reduce operating costs. People who are planning to start a business might not know where wasteful costs can be cut, and they will greatly benefit from reading this book."
books,14 of 95,1.0,Crank-theory and work of an amateur,"A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a ""key"" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's ""will"" and race as the key to a ""kultur's"" success."

books,,5.0,Born In Death,"Eve and Roarke fans will love this selection!!!!  The last chapter had me holding my ribs in laughter!  As usual Eve works to exhaustion.  Although the mysteries, I agree with other posts, were transparent, it will not disappoint diehard fans!!!  This series continues to surprise me that it still has so much life left in it!  Bravo JD Robb"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Very Insightful Look At An Amazing Celebrity!,"I have to admit that I'm a huge U2 fan, and a huge Bono fan.  So my thoughts on this book may be a bit biased.  But on that note, I figure that I-like so many other U2 fans who've read this book-have a greater ability to give criticism.  I've read numerous U2 books on varying subjects, so I guess I was expecting nothing more than a carbon copy, for the most part, of those books.  This was not a carbon copy!  I echo other reviewers who said they loved the conversational style of the book.  It makes me wish more people would do something like this rather than just beefed-up, ghost written memoirs that hardly reveal anything.  But Assayas does a great job at keeping Bono (one who has a tendency to deviate and ramble) on subject.  Bono himself explains how he's a very forward-looking person and doesn't like to revisit the past.  Assayas spends a good portion of the book having Bono look back."
books,15 of 21,1.0,Please Be Careful,"Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of ""natural"" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you"
books,1 of 1,2.0,A Bit Disappointed,"I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like ""The Notebook"" or ""The Wedding"" if you want a good romantic read."
books,1 of 1,5.0,The Killer Angels,"For history buffs, students and Civil War fanatics I would advise them to read this book and then see the movies ""Gettysburg"" that was made a few years ago.  The books is about as sharp as one can get when covering the horrors of war.  The characterizations are very sharp as and the story telling from the beginning of the battle to after its end is about as accurate as it comes.  Sometimes one can actually see the action and often it is disturbing.  This novel should be required reading in High School and College history classes"
books,8 of 9,5.0,A highly accessible guide filled with examples and plain common sense,"Organizational Behavior and Human Resources professor Richard Boyatzis and Co-chair of Teleos Leadership Institute Annie McKee present Resonant Leadership, a guide to the three key elements - mindfulness, hope, and compassion - that are critical to enabling renewal and stability in great leaders. Emphasizing the importance of balance so as to avoid burnout and the precipitation of failure due to exhaustion and excessive stress, Resonant Leadership is an optimistic yet serious-minded discourse about what it takes to be a leader in an increasingly pressurized world. A highly accessible guide filled with examples and plain common sense."
books,1 of 5,5.0,Frey touched my heart,"I have always wondered what happens in a Treatment center. How do people stop being an addict? What do they do all day? What kind of people are in a treatment center? This book answers those questions and shows that there's hope for every addict. I think it's an excellent read. A gift to all addicts.  It's exiting, I couldn't put it down and I thought about it quit a lot."
books,,4.0,Goes Through Cars Like Toilet Paper,"It's been a while since I've read one of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, but a sudden need for light reading found Ten Big Ones at the book store.  Plum's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after Joe Morelli or Ranger, how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station, and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed.  Definitely light fare, even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic. He not only wants Stephanie dead, but he also wants her end to be spectacular."
books,3 of 15,2.0,"If he couldn't beat them, he joined them.","First he says he cracked down on all those ""liberals"" but yet he admits to loving their evil ways. If this is as wishy washy as he can get, no wonder he and Sam Donaldson get along ! You can't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same ""liberal media"". If he were working as a farmer in Idaho for instance, he'd have more credibility but I'm not so sure Stossel says what he means"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Entertaining and Informative,"When I started reading River's End, it reminded me of a remake of the ""O.J. Simpson"" murder.  It is a story centered on a little 4-year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father.  Years pass by and the story unravels Olivia's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy.  Written in the ingenious Nora Roberts style I have grown to truly enjoy, this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the Olympic Rain Forest through Olivia's eyes.  I guessed the villain about 1/2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as I could never be 100% sure I was correct.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone."
books,7 of 14,5.0,Great collection of stories,"I thought that this book would be one that would be mediocre when I started it, but good gracious, was I mistaken! It was a wonderful series of tales that I couldn't put down. I rarely read such interesting stories and the ones featured here are gems"

books,24 of 26,5.0,"Borrowed Title, Missing Bits, Worthy Restatement of the Threat to Labor","The title appears borrowed from Sam Marcy's original work in 1979 on ""The Global Class War and the Destiny of American Labor,"" but then, no one wanted to listen in the 1970's, when I did my first master's degree, to the three major themes in the political science literature:"
books,2 of 2,5.0,as u like it!!,"This book was one of my best loved Shakespeare's plays. It really gave me comfort and laugh whenever I read it. I hope in real lifre I can find a forest like the one in the play so I can hide my self there and live &quot;as I like it&quot;. Rosaind is the best female character in the literature for her sense of humour and intelligence, and passion. Orlando reminds all those who ever loved of their first love, the bittersweet and compelling passion that one is not capable of getting rid of. If you had spare time, you really should read this play, I guarantee the language in this play is not that hard and you will find yourself so into this fantastic tale once you started reading it"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Magical!,"&quot;As You Like It&quot; is bar none, one of Shakespeare's VERY best works.  It is probably the most poetic of the comedies and contains perhaps as many famous quotations as any other of his plays.  Rosalind is perhaps his greatest female character and this work, along with the equally (or even more) brilliant &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; is the best example of Shakespeare's theme of the &quot;dream world&quot; vs. the &quot;real&quot; world.  This play, especially the scenes in the forest, is a celebration of language and the power of the freedom of the imagination.  It consequently can be read as a criticism of the &quot;real world,&quot; here represented by Duke Ferdinand's court.  Like many of the other comedies, Shakespeare is mocking the &quot;ideal&quot; which many in his society would have praised.  Though this play deals with some pretty dark themes (which of his plays doesn't?) it is a light-hearted and fully enjoyable read"

books,4 of 4,5.0,Beautiful Sequel,"This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables.  It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college.  Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad.  It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first).  Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change).  For anyone who liked the first book, this is sure to not disappoint"
books,2 of 10,4.0,Good Starting Point,"Bereavement:  Counseling the Grieving throughout the Life Cycle is a compact little book that covers the basics of grief counseling.  Author David A. Crenshaw Ph.D. presents his theory of the tasks of mourning that must be accomplished in order for the grieving individual to attain a healthy resolution to the loss.  These tasks appear to owe an acknowledgement to the five stages of grief proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.  Crenshaw goes on to apply his seven tasks to six identified life cycle stages:  preschool children, school-age children, adolescents, young adults, adults in midlife, and the elderly, using abbreviated case histories as examples."
books,2 of 8,5.0,Read the book before you review it,"To those who think this book recommends ignorning a hungry child just because he ate 2 hours ago rather than the prescribed 3, I suggest you read the book a little more carefully. The feeding schedule is just a guideline, and the book does emphasize (in several places) that when your child is hungry, food should never be denied, hunger cues should never be ignored. Parents: read the book, then make up your mind on whether or not this technique is one you want to adopt. If you haven't read the book, keep your opinions to yourself. No one cares to know what you learned after doing a google search on the author. If the information in the book makes sense to you, and your pediatrician doesn't disagree, does it really matter in what subject the author earned his master's degree?"
books,1 of 2,4.0,Fired Up!,"Bill Rancic, the dashing winner of the first season of  Donald Trump's runaway-hit reality show The Apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book You're Hired: How to Succeed in Business and Life that he never went to business school and that he doesn't believe that business theory can be learned from a book.  What then is the affable Mr. Rancic doing offering advice on good and  ethical business practices?  Making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame, that's what.  In two hundred pages, he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215,000 applicants to become the Donald's first `Apprentice.'  The reader is privy to Mr. Rancic's early entrepreneurial efforts, businesses that whet his appetite for something larger.  Readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition.  Through it all, Rancic recounts the lessons he's learned, persons he's admired, falls from which he's risen.  He offers opinions on Kwame Jackson, his fellow runner-up to the Apprentice title, and `deceitful' Omarosa, whom many believed was the cause of Jackson's loss.  He also details lessons he's learned on goals, values, strategies, leadership, vision, and success.  While business school grads may scoff at Rancic's straight-shooting and simplistic advice, it is less idealistic than The One Minute Manager series of books.  Here, Rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams.  The result is one that is as memorable, yet as pleasing, as a tall glass of lemonade."

books,4 of 4,5.0,Truly insightful,"If you want to know about baseball, this is the one book you MUST read.  From the early days of robber-baron owners, to the formation of the most powerful union in the world, this book tells it all in great detail.  I cannot recommend it enough to fans of the game as well as anyone interested in the history of business in America.  It has been said that to know the history of America, you must know the history of baseball.  This book exemplifies that thought.  Its out of print, but try as hard as you can to find a copy.  You will not be dissapointed"

Each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between O'Malley and Holden. The latest installment in this series is no exception."

books,1 of 1,5.0,"Funny, absurd cartoons","Sick, absurd humor is Larson's specialty, and in this collection, Larson is at his best. Many of the cartoons involve reversals of the roles of species, where animals get their revenge on humans. Others are based on themes from popular culture, such as Tonto on his horse outside the outhouse telling Kemosabe that the music is starting. They are funny, but there are times where you have to spend some time interpreting the diagram. If you are a fan of Larson's unique brand of humor, then you will love this collection."
books,9 of 9,5.0,a dummy's cookbook for smart people,"This book is incredibly informative. It's everything I wanted to learn about food, but was too lazy to ask -- where it comes from, what to look for when buying it, how to cut it all up... and that's aside from the great recipes. This mass of info is fortunately so intelligently written and laid out that it never really feels like overload. I'd put the book on my coffee table if I didn't need it so much in the kitchen."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Insight on The Concept of Indexing,"Mr. Bogle, the founder of The Vanguard Group, does an excellent job explaining the value of indexing and shows historical and relative information that bases his knowledge on facts. A great book for any investor, both new and experienced, that will help make your investment strategy more intelligent and educated - especially if you believe that it's almost impossible to beat the market on your own. The book can be difficult to read at times, so make sure your energy level is high before you indulge"

books,3 of 3,5.0,Highly recommended,"This book is one of the first great books that Dr. Kubler-Ross has gifted us with.  Her insight and compassion are unremarkable.  I am sad she won't be writing any more books though.  Her latest book, ""On Grief and Grieving"" is a wonderful book also.  There are some case studies to go by and it truly touches your soul."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Once upon a time...,"...David Sedaris was only famous for talking about Christmas. Santaland Diaries, heard on NPR stations across the country, is what gave him his first fame. This collection of stories came after his first book, Barrel Fever, and before the rest. This is back when he was still writing short stories, which he isn't really known for anymore. This book has a couple of short stories and, like the short stories in Barrel Fever, they're not really accessible to a wider audience. They're dark - baby murder dark. Definitely not something everyone can appreciate. But pick it up, maybe you'll like it. If you're the sort of person who finds the idea of a theatre critic reviewing children's holiday pageants bitterly, it's worth a try"
books,6 of 9,5.0,Brilliant,I have read the 48 laws of Power by the author. This book is even better. It is fascinating and practical. The book is gripping and laced with strategy and tactical wiles to emerge as winners in the modern game of combat and existence. Must read.
books,5 of 5,5.0,Highly Recommended!,"Once upon a time in the halls of academia, being a college graduate was enough. But now, corporations need their employees to have a more intense, ongoing academic and technical education, so they provide it themselves via corporate universities. Mark Allen and other experts from ten corporate universities, academic institutions and consultancies contributed chapters to The Corporate University Handbook, a practical, behind-the-scenes manual about designing and managing a corporate university. The goal goes beyond education: corporate universities must train employees and help corporations excel and prosper. This thorough, yet conversational, examination includes best practices, source notes and programs offered by specific companies including Motorola, Toyota, Sun Microsystems and Charles Schwab, in the U.S. and elsewhere. We from getAbstract assign this insightful book as an authoritative homework seminar for corporate university planners or managers"

books,2 of 2,5.0,"Fun, really.","First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as ""important,"" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading"
books,4 of 8,5.0,Enjoyed This Book!,"When I was pregnant my first time, I carried this around everywhere!  I was hungry for knowledge and this seemed to be the only book that I could refer to more frequently than just the month-to-month!  I had wished that there was a day-to-day book, but this came very close to providing me with new information as frequently as possible.  It is a staple of the pregnancy book diet!"
books,,1.0,Disapointed,"I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there."
books,9 of 12,5.0,A note from this book's author,"I am saddened by the utterly unfair and inappropriate posting here by one reader. She had not read the book, but because I am a mere moderate feminist rather than a radical one, she chooses to excoriate me here. A far more unbiased source, USA Today's review of my book said, ""From finding the well-suited job to customizing it, this book is full of smart advice."" In the Reader's Choice Poll, it was rated the #1 most useful career guide. Here on Amazon, you can read sample material from the book. I encourage you to do that before making your decision"
books,2 of 3,5.0,If you love baseball...,"and even if you know nothing about baseball like me, Kearns Goodwin has hit a home run with ""Wait till Next Year.""  You will learn all about the rivalry between the Mets and the Yankees and the history of Goodwin's beloved Brooklyn Dodgers. She tells all about her heroes Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges and Roy Campanella. All of these great baseball nuggets are woven into her story of growing up in Brooklyn in the '50s, and is so evocative of a time and place that was quintessentially American. This book will make you long for a town like Rockville Centre, sometime between 1949 and 1957"
books,3 of 14,1.0,"This book is a ""must pass""","I can't believe people are actually raving about this book. I was so offended by the inappropriate language that I could not possibly enjoy the experience of reading the story. The main character is acting like she is 3, rather than 32. This is hardly destined to be a classic and I would not recommend it to anyone who has any literary taste."

Marie Giles opened her heart and soul to eloquently pour on to the written page what most of us would find a struggle just to bring forth in a coherent thought.  As I read her words, it is as if she has some how reached inside my being and helped to articulate to my guiding principals.  I truly enjoyed and continue to enjoy this book as I keep it on my desk at work and when I need a break from a stressful situation or just a quick pick-me up I read a page or two.  Thank you Marie Giles for your wonderful words!!"

Not an anemic gloss-over, nor a ""health and wealth"" God-as-geanie recipe book.  Jill challenges the reader to make real grown-up Christian decisions about truly living your life for Christ, but does it in a wonderfully humble and loving style.  With plenty of scripture and real-life examples, it is one of those books that are easy and enjoyable to read, but not a quick read because it is constantly prayer and thought provoking"

Instead, (in the book on tape), I got 5-10 minutes about the different types of bonds, a little detail about T-bills, and the frank admission that this book &quot;doesn't really discuss corporate bonds&quot;. WHAT!? The whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 - for that, I must say he was prescient (Too bad I didn't read this in 1999!). More time is spent describing the basics of common stocks, and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds! Oh - and that WRONG formula for computing the price/sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version. I actually had to rewind the tape to see if I had heard correctly"

Some of those peoples could easily be the finaciers of all threatened peoples including themselves.  Some examples of state socities that might not be around in 2100 are Beglium, the Neatherlands, and the small island nations as well as others.

books,5 of 6,4.0,Back to his depressing roots,"John Le Carre has been writing suspense, espionage, and mystery novels for more than 40 years now. I read the first few of them when I was in high school (say 30 years ago) and enjoyed them, mostly for the odd characters that the author peopled his books with. Over the years, he's written everything from straight spy novels (""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and ""Smiley's People"") around to more romantic spy novels (""The Russia House""), comic versions of the spy novel (""The Tailor of Panama"") and even attempted serious straight fiction (the largely unsuccessful ""The Naive and Sentimental Lover""). Many of the previous books are more cheerful, or eccentric stories, so it's important for the purposes of this review to remember what first got Le Carre attention. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, which was published basically at the same time as the James Bond movies, and which featured a rather drab, mundane spy who actually failed to fulfill his mission, and (I'm going to give away the plot here) actually gets killed at the end of the book failing to save the girl. If you keep that in mind, when I tell you that the current book is about a pharmaceutical multinational corporation and one man's challenge to it, you'll have an idea what the book is like."

The lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial - as if summing up Churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims.  What Mr Hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us (women included). I learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work (I too can work on my short-comings); he had many failures, some fatal for a politician, but continued to soldier on (I too can persevere); he stuck with his own sense of self-worth when every one else proclaimed him as finished (I too can maintain confidence against adversity).  The maxims, Mr Hayward, are not needed. But thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth, where we can all learn from his extraordinary life"

Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself."

I really enjoyed Greene's book 42 laws of power (I can't remember if it's 42 or some other number), but this book is a great reminder and educator of the way things work behind the scenes, in people's minds, and at the macro level of every business and political dealing.

books,4 of 5,5.0,A very lucid treatment of reincarnation and psychotherapy,Joan Grant and her husband Denys Kelsey take turns writing their accounts of life in France during and after WWII and how they use her gift of seeing into the far past--past lives--to help psychologically maimed patients. The  tone is very humble and yet matter-of-factly and helps us understand our  own continuity and moral responsibilities. Suffering is indeed unnecessary  and death is nothing to be afraid of
books,25 of 27,1.0,Weak,I have this book and it is weak as hell.  It doesn't give you anything common sense can't figure out for you.  It doesn't explain anything in great detail enough to help you out at all.  Don't waste your money.  Try trial &amp; error.  - Shabam the moderately sober fat mac
books,13 of 13,2.0,Disappointing and formulaic,"Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as ""Cheaters never win"") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Gripping and Very Well Written,I found The Good House to be an exceptionally well written and suspenseful novel. The author did an excellent job of developing the story and the characters.
books,5 of 8,5.0,Informative for leftists/terrorist supporters,"I'm quite familiar with Mr. Ledeen's work on National Review and eagerly anticipated reading this tome.  It doesn't disappoint, although some of the details are common knowledge to those intelligent enough to know what the goals of those that have used the ""ROP"" to justify murdering civilians in order to install a global caliphate (yes, of course, not all Muslims feel this way about the infidels.  Mr. Daniel Pipes breaks it into thirds:  1/3 appalled at the terrorists, 1/3 that would not personally engage in terrorism but don't mind others involvement and 1/3 that want to kill us all)."
books,8 of 10,4.0,CEO impact on lower-level managers needed in book,"This book contained a lot of good material concerning the interaction of Carly Fiorina and her highest-level executives.  However, Burrows' coverage of her impact on lower level managers in critical positions was inadequate.  The failures of such managers can have major impacts on HP for potentially decades and thus deserve scrutiny.  A good example prior to the Fiorina era was when HP lost over 60 points of market share in the technical workstation market in the 1980s which also led over time to a weakened server market position, due to lost technical and financial leverage.  The current value of this loss may be as high as 10 billion dollars in revenue yearly."
books,0 of 1,4.0,One Thing After Another,"The story seems to go on forever. It is a novel after all; a very long one. Each character possesses his/her own specialty but most of them are either archeologists or in the medical profession. The final showdown is worth the reading and waiting. It is interesting to witness the deduction method used in solving the ultimate mystery - who is the person behind all the killings. Romance genre deals with various types of relationship confusions and this one is no exception. Conveniently, Dr. Dunbrook arrives in a small town for a dig to land herself in turmoil of a kidnapping case - her own. That leads her to hiring a lawyer to find out the truth. The man she never gets over is there to win her heart again. Her brother who she didn't grow up with has his own love interest. A divorced couple find each other once more. Everything boils down to loyalty among friends, lovers, and family members. Not easy to achieve and understand in real life but in a fiction it is all swell and great which makes up the utmost joy in reading"
books,1 of 4,4.0,impossible to believe...,what an honest author.  he had a difficult life that most people would choose to forget rather than share.
books,1 of 3,4.0,Well-written book,"For those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one, you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages.  Statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through.  The writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of China and its muscle power.  Instead of branding China as a villain, we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains, China wouldn't be where it is now.  Wal-Mart is covered in detail.  The writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing, it's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when China has perfected its manufacturing bases just as Japan and South Korea had done before it.  Then, there's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located, and how China is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour.  China's progress isn't simply detrimental to other countries.  On contrary, it benefits them as well.  For example, Australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to China.  With increase of living standard in China, Chinese needs more nutritious food.  As China couldn't provide enough, United States particularly the Middle States are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the Middle Kingdom.  Then, there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping United States in check by siding with China, and also the love and hate relationship between USA and China of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in China and so forth.  Whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided (since China has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time), suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks.  Yes, some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately, I think they are missing the points.  What's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about China and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come.  Highly recommended"

There really  are other options besides statin drugs and their unwanted side effects.   It is sad that more doctors don't give advice and information like this to their patients.. I admire Dr. Fuhrman so much for the  tireless effort he puts into helping us learn ways to  cure illness and  live longer, healthier lives.

books,,4.0,Kept me reading,"The only complaint I have is the main character always seems in pain! It is tiring! And confusing, the reader is to be drawn by her strength but she is always in a constant romantic quandry and nursing wounds. Otherwise the storyline was strong and interesting.

books,6 of 11,5.0,Well worth the coin and time!,"This is how history should be written. The author thesis that ""ism"" has been the monkey on Mans back for the most of the 20th century is steel on target. This book has a lot for one to ponder on."

books,,2.0,Too Drawn Out,"Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it"

They are very upset with their decision to work at this law firm but will do anything to get out of this very mysterious firm."
books,6 of 9,1.0,Poorly written,"I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: ""When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety,"" the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news."

It's a must have for any amateur photographer"

You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars!"

books,38 of 101,1.0,I have more to say if I just had more room!!,"I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations."

It starts of bout a family of three that live in Great Falls, Montana. The father Jerry was a Professional golfer later leaves he's famil to volunteer as a fire fighter. While that was going on the mother, Jean, started to have an affair with a man name Warren Miller who knew her husband.

books,6 of 9,4.0,"Good, first bio on Liz Bently","Although the life of Elizabeth Bently deserves a bigger book, I enjoyed this first biography of the enigmatic but fascinating commie spy, Elizabeth Bently. The author attempts to explain this Vassar educated American woman who became a Russian spy, but Bently still remains a vague phantom. Since I'm fascinated by that whole period--of Joe McCarthy, Alger Hiss, the shocking presence of real-life commnists in American government back in the 30s and 40s--I found this book very readable. You might also enjoy related books, especially Ann Coulter's best-selling, &quot;Treason,&quot; which really delivers the goods about how the Communist scare of the 40s and 50s was not the imaginary fear of paranoid Americans. It really was something to cause genuine fear. Elizabeth Bently revealed just have intensive this spy network was"

books,4 of 4,5.0,Great,"The best writers--or at least the most memorable--are the ones who can break the rules of writing and somehow still tell a great story or convince us of something. Jones often changes points of view, shifts time, and fills his stories with a variety of characters. He seems to lack the ability to write a one-dimensional, uninteresting character. Even the one or two stories in the collection that I didn't particularly like left me wanting to read more. And I felt as I read the stories that each was so well wrought and imagined that Jones could easily turn them each into novels."
books,,5.0,A fascinating history and a must read for every American.,"I decided to read this book after enjoying ""1776.""  I was instantly enthralled by the life of John Adams.  McCollough is such an interesting writer and this book has been thoroughly researched.  I became quite connected to John Adams during my reading, and I was moved to tears at several points in the book.  I knew so little about him before reading this biography, but when I completed this book I felt like I had lost a dear friend.  In addition to his personal life, the reader will learn more about the Continental Congress, The Declaration of Independance, the forming of the U.S. government, early U.S. foreign relations, and of course all of the interesting men and women who lived during the early years of the formation of the new country.  This is a wonderful, compelling read"

books,3 of 10,5.0,Best Introductory Book on Derivatives,"It is not surprising that Hull's book is the standard text in introductory graduate derivatives courses.  You clearly see a no nonsense format in his book that is the same for all serious finance books (i.e. black text on a white background with only shades of gray).  Being an intro book, he jumps steps in some of the more challenging derivations for the beginner like in the Black-Scholes options pricing model and doesn't discuss Ito calculus in much detail.  However, there are clearly books that focus on those topics and they are clearly more advanced than for an intro course.  This book is a definite must buy"
books,5 of 5,5.0,"Pictures, pictures, pictures!","I have a six year old son who loves this book, especially the pictures.

He absolutely loves it."
books,1 of 1,5.0,A Must Have Book For Any King Fan,"I have read this book twice now and have also read another of Beahm's books. They are hands down GREAT. I originally picked up this book as a Stephen King fan, but needed it for a school report. It gave me so much more information than I could have POSSIBLY dreamed of. While still be intriguing, it gives neat facts, important information and everything else about King's writing career as well as his life. Don't take this as a book of records though; it's a good book to pick up and read for pleasure. There are many stories that are woven into this book as well as King's family and life. It's a worthwhile book for any person who enjoys Stephen King's work as well as those who want to learn about the man BEHIND the pages"
books,2 of 5,5.0,Fine literature,"Most of what I read is modern. The stories take place in the here and now, and are dialogue-heavy. It's nice to read something ""old-fashioned,"" where the words are important. If this were a story of privileged young Americans, I wouldn't be interested; but change the country and the era, and the same story becomes interesting"

books,1 of 1,4.0,"great recipes, clear instructions","First, I want to say that this is the paperback version of The Cooks Illustrated Complete Book of Poultry (different title, different cover design.) This is a great book especially for those who eat a lot of chicken and are looking for a variety of ways to prepare it, like me. There are recipes for dishes from many different traditions, which I like, and all are tasty. If you look at the table of contents, you'll see that they are arranged by cooking method, which is handy. And the book has all the explanations and clear directions typical of Cooks Illustrated books. My absolutely only complaint is that I appreciate it when an entire recipe is printed across two open pages, so I can put it in my cookbook stand and leave it there, and that is not the case here: I have to turn the page. But that's minor. Highly recommended"

This has been a life changing book for me and is helping me to finally understand what it really means to grow up.

books,13 of 17,2.0,Not What I thought,"As a student starting law school I thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class, boy was  wrong... The book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student. It is however, very basic in its approach and gives you a good start, so it is not a total waste.., The subtitle says that the book is for ""non-lawyers"", as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun. my recomendation is, that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book, but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer, trust me it is well worth the fees. Among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list, in the case of Lexis-Nexis and West Law require very expensive memberships and that most Law Schools restrict the use of their Law Library to students in their Law School and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the Law Library, as the Law Students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the Library and Legal Librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome."
books,7 of 23,1.0,AWFUL,"Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story."

For students wending their way through the thickets of the Kant literature, this book simply must be studied with care"

Keeping with the philosophy of perl - there is more than one way to do it - the book shows you ingenious ways to work with this powerful language. This is a true hacks book and meant mostly for the advanced user. Before reading this book, I didn't even realize what I didn't know and I rate myself just short of contributing to CPAN. Even if you have read all the popular books - Perl Programming, Perl Best Practices etc. you'll still find a lot of gems."

He begins by providing a persuading argument that dogs do think and show emotions.  Then an interesting history is given of the views on the dog's mind throughout history, along with the three main proposed views of what dogs were first domesticated and used by people.  Coren provides a few sections that are especially useful in interpreting what your dog is thinking or trying to say.  I am a veterinary assistant and am around a lot of dogs all day, and these lists did provide me with some new information."

The print is legible, the features are outstanding, especially the Dictionary in the back, and the excellent Concordance. I also have the top-of-the-line edition from Allan's of Glasgow, which very much surpasses this calfskin edition. Cambridge leather Bibles, in my opinion, are not of the same quality as they were 10 years ago. They now tend to be stiff as the proverbial board. It will last a lifetime. No glue-bound, cheap American mass-produced garbage here. This is a Bible to carry wherever you go. Well worth the extra dollars you spend."

Building Security is simply the best work on the subject out there and I highly recommend it."
books,2 of 4,5.0,If I Had One Book on a Deserted Island...,"This is one of the best, most enjoyable books ever written, in my opinion.  It is a combination history (of a now by-gone America), essay (on what it means to be American, on the coming modern world, on racism, on travel, even on what the mind of a dog may be thinking), memoir, history, travelogue and poem.  Steinbeck sets off with his dog Charley in a glorified pickup truck to see America in 1960.  He explores as many themes along the way as he does landscapes and states.  He meets people, he offers opinions, he converses with his pal Charley, and he offers a comment on America - past, present, and future.  I find this a fascinating, thoroughly enjoyable (and I'd even say ""classic"") read.  And I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to reflect on America and travel with Charley and the great author who drove him around.  For those familiar with John Steinbeck only as a writer of fiction, this book reveals a new side, and one I think you will enjoy"
books,6 of 6,5.0,"Wampeters, Foma, & Granfalloons","Cat's Cradle is basically a unique and creative look at the end of the world.  To me, Vonnegut is arguing that the dizzying progress of science and technology in the last century has made the total destruction of life on earth a frightening possibility, and it's not just the ""bad guys"" that threaten humanity with annihilation:  an equal threat comes from the well-intentioned but short-sighted, from the lonely or downtrodden, from the greatest superpower to the tiniest and poorest island nation."
books,8 of 9,5.0,A great book,Buffett has a very uniquly apt understanding of many modern business practices and investment strategy along with the ability to explain these concepts in a down to earth framework.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt they didn't understand what was going on in corporate america
books,,5.0,Visual Magic Wonderland,"This book is a gem, a pearl for all visual arts aficionados. It intrigues you, it provokes you, it challenges you into seeing - and thinking - from another perspective: sideways. You can't read it - or even peruse it - all in one sitting, but you will find yourself going to it again and again looking for some artistic stimuli and visual intelligence and wit."
books,17 of 17,5.0,Millions of Readers Have Been Moved By This Classic...,"I still have my original copy.  It's very tattered and worn after the 100s of hours of reading and re-reading, but it remains an important part of my life.  This book has had the most significant impact on my life than any other book I've read (not including the BIBLE)."
books,7 of 7,4.0,A winning formula,"If your learning style is to learn a formula, then expand from there, then this is the perfect approach for you. Let me be clear: If you are a beginner, learning the craft, then this is a good place to start, one of the two best books on novel writing in my opinion. But this book will work for you only if you are best served by learning a basic formula first, then building upon it and venturing into the unknown or breaking the rules. Here's another way to look at it -- Some people can learn to drive a stick shift and traffic rules at the same time; others do better with an automatic transmission, allowing them to concentrate on learning traffic rules in a vehicle that shifts by itself (a formula), then later learning to use a manual transmission. If you are in this latter category, someone who learns better by first mastering the well-beaten path, then this is the best book to get you started"
books,2 of 2,5.0,LOVE+PEACE=INFORMATION,"This was one of the first Stephen King book I have read, I first read it back in 2002 and just got through with it agian. And it still moved me just as much as when I first read it. It's hard to explain just how it ""moved"" me, I'm not even sure if I know completly."
books,,5.0,Excellent book,"After I read the first installment, I passed it along to my 13 year old daughter. She has never been an avid reader, but she could not put that book down. I ordered this one specifically so she would continue reading over the summer. She enjoyed this one just as much. After her friends got through reading the books, I finally got it back and found this to be a very entertaining book as well. People can not believe that I would give a James Patterson book to my 13 year old. This is well suited for that age group. I highly recommend it"

books,12 of 12,5.0,Well worth wading through.,"This large but highly readable work covers the history and context of emerging or re-emerging communicable diseases affecting the world today.  As a physician with a Masters in Public Health I could appreciate the challenge this author faced in presenting this complex and important topic. She has made remarkably few minor technical errors while presenting fields as diverse as virology, immunology and disease ecology in a clear and compelling manner.  She places the emerging diseases in the social, economic and political context that helps to explain why diseases occur where and when they do and why and how they impact individuals and societies.  Although the jacket copy seems to imply a sensationalized account, the story the author tells is a balanced and highly professional one.  In a world grown ever smaller and more tightly connected the issue of communicable disease and public health will impact all our lives and deserves the attention of every citizen."

books,10 of 10,5.0,This Mystery Flows to Excellence!,"In RIVER'S END, Nora Roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years: A story of Hollywood's glamour gone astray, and the young girl who survived it. But this isn't a typical plot by any means, not with Roberts' doing the writing. She guarantees many unexpected events along the way!"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Very important book,"I got this book for my birthday one year after finding it on the shelf at a bookstore. Being a part of the minority group of gay Christians, I was intrigued. The ""target audience"" for the book is for homosexuals and their loved ones, but it really could be read by anyone, and I think it should be. McNeill offers theology on living in fear, guilt, shame, anger, and living with pathological faith and the importance of maturing spiritually. I think any Christian can relate to any (if not all) of these topics, and not just struggling gay Christians. It's the kind of book that you may want to read with a pencil or pen in your hand so you can underline parts that are important to you. (That's what I did.) This is a caring, humble, and comforting book, and one that I highly recommend and cherish"
books,,5.0,Simply Great!,"Sports economics fascinates me, and MLB economics is especially fascinating.  The most powerful trade union in the world for the past two decades as been the MLPA, and this book explains why.  After getting my initial wake up call about the stupidity of baseball's ownership through Bouton's Ball Four lo those many years ago, Lords merely cements my opinion.  A more venal, greedy group would be hard to find in any other industry.  Big on detail, impecably researched and tightly written, this is a must read for all baseball fans, especially for those of you in a city which is being brow beaten into building a stadium with public funds"
books,0 of 2,4.0,Andromeda Strains Your Brain,"The Andromeda Strain is a story about a virus that was exposed to a small town in Arizona, Piedmont.  Piedmont was a desolate ton to begin with, and only got worse after a strange and unknown virus took the lives of all the citizens, save two.  This is when the story begins to get juicy.  These two survivors, a small child and an old man, are then transferred to a maximum security laboratory in Nevada.  From here a team of scientists work toward investigating the virus."
books,2 of 2,5.0,The Very Best,"A truly remarkable, thoroughly enjoyable book! Having read ""John Adams"" and ""1776"", I was looking forward to reading Truman with great anticipation. This book exceeded my expectations! While reading this book, it seemed as if it were warmly written by a close, caring family friend. No skipping through long passages here. So interesting and informative is McCullough's style of writing,that I wanted to read each and every word he wrote. I now have a greater appreciation for a much under-appreciated president and all the noteworthy and far reaching events of Truman's era. An added note about the large size of the book - I placed a throw pillow on my lap underneath the book - made it more comfortable to read. Since first reading ""John Adams"", I've become an enthusiastic fan of David McCullough. I plan to read each and every book he has written!"
books,7 of 7,5.0,Interesting read for those that want to understand Italian culture,"In the introduction the authors tell us that the purpose of the book is to provide snapshots of daily life.  If you have ever been to Italy you know that they have a different notion of what it means to live.  Every visit that I have every made to Italy there has been a general strike that has taken place.  The first time I visited Italy this fact mystified me.  Now, I just know that this is what happens and I don't let it bother me."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Mother of child diagnosed with autism spectrum,"Having had to wait 10 years because of infertility, I was so ready for children.  When Jordan came into our lives, I had so many questions only this book could answer.  I got to know the milestones a baby should come across, the things we as parents are to expect and the missing details that a pediatrician can't have time to dwell on because of the busy schedule he/she keeps.  Have you ever experienced that?  How many of us enjoy a visit to the pediatrician that spans 30 - 40 minutes?  Not many.  So this book helped.  When our second child arrived miraculously (we were told that we could not have anymore), this book helped us once again to determine that because of missing milestones, we had to be concerned about our baby's mental and physical health.  I highly recommend this book to new moms because if you can't remember to ask your doctor every question you had, ask the book.  Read, read, read.  It was our baby bible.  And by the way, our first book has been passed around so many times.  It has gone to another state in the USA, Hongkong, China and Singapore.  And I just bought another one for a colleague."

I cooked and ate my food with it in hand, and sometimes damned my inability to read faster, I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next."
books,4 of 7,2.0,Just Okay,I was a little disappointed in this book.  There isn't much new information that I didn't know already.  The information presented wasn't in-depth enough.  It's good for people who are getting introduced to real estate

books,7 of 7,5.0,Cosell and Ali-Media darlings,"Sound and Fury (14 hours, 11 cds, unabridged, Blackstone Audio) is a duel biography of Howard Cosell and Mohammed Ali."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Claer and concise explanations,"This book offers a very clear description of a subject that most people find dry and boring.  Instead of referring to countless graphs and charts, Hazlitt manages to explain his assertations using common sense and language that a non-economist can easily understand.  This is that same format of the monthly newsletter 'Ideas on Liberty', published by the Foundation for Economic Education, which aims to improve the understanding of economics among laypeople(The Foundation has long been a supporter of Hazlitt).  One interesting thing to note is that Hazlitt was not formally trained as an economist, and I believe that's one of the reasons that he is able to state all these concepts succintly with no confusion.  Even more amazing is that the same policies that he speaks against and that have failed are being tried again, with nothing more that a different name and some other minor changes.  For those who think economics has to be confusing, I wholeheartedly recommend this book"

books,1 of 1,5.0,An oldie goldie - fabulous concept,"Has it been so long? 1998?? This is one of the first books that I reviewed on the internet - I was asked to write it, and made me a John Case fan - This book deals with a fertiliy clinic that has amazing donors - and the plans from the church to stop it. The last page is a catch your breath ending. A stranger in a local bookstore asked me if I'd ever read John Case - he was happy I knew the book. I was proud of that first review - and still like to dabble in writing. Of course books like Case's make it easy -"
books,10 of 11,5.0,Amazing - Motivates kids to eat healthy and be more active!,"How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch &amp; cheeseburger behind)"

books,14 of 18,4.0,Fine review of American history,"Kenneth C Davis presents an unvarnished look at the history of America from Columbus to mid-2002. His viewpoint incorporates modern scholarship and sensibilities and avoids the traditional oatmeal that America is always right and good, but not in a particularly accusatory or condemning way. For example, it exposes Jackson, Sherman, and others for their mistreatment of the Indians but doesn't actually condemn them. It explains Washington and Jefferson's ownership of slaves without apologizing for them."
books,34 of 36,5.0,Live the Life as the Ancient Masters,"In this short work by Manly Hall, he digresses into the little known subject of how the ancient masters of the mystery schools go about teaching their students. Much has changed in the way of secret societies since the days of Plato and Pythagoras, however, the principles are generally the same. Silence is still of utmost importance. In the times of Pythagoras, silence was not only a virtue, but something your life depended upon. Today, you will not get crucified or burned at the stake for revealing secrets from a society, however, your integrity and Will are disseminated. Silence today stands as a virtue more than anything, but one that most people neglect. This short book also looks into the practices of the Student, Disciple and Initiate, as the basic three grades of the practitioner once they have entered a mystery school. Even today all of these attitudes that Hall speaks about have complete practicality in today's culture. It is less about environment and more about the demeanor of the practitioner. If one does not take in all of the ideas represented in this book, surely one or two of them will cling to the readers mind as not only possible, but inspirational. For those that have been practicing the secret arts for a period of time, this book may serve as a good reminder of why they are doing what they do to begin with"
books,,5.0,razor sharp wit,"The cover of my book features its author badly sunburned holding a keyboard on the beach and squinting into the camera. The collected columns display the same kind of amused perplexity. With quirky wit, Barry skewers such tempting targets as Ed McMahon, baseball fans, Tupperware parties, mutant fleas, inept motorists, chipper ski instructors, and of course, the dangers of indoor plumbing.. There's even a brief foray into serious territory with the genuinely touching. ""A Million Words."" A must for Barry fans."
books,4 of 9,5.0,For one moment he raised the human race.,"There is that silly cult movie about wrestling called ""Vision Quest"" where Elmo (J.C. Quinn) talks to Louden (Mathew Modine) who is not going to wrestle the meanest (you know what) wrestler in the valley, and J. C. Quinn talks about Pele, scoring an impossible goal, on his back, turned the other way, and he tells Louden that for one moment that effort raised the human spirit. Allright. Granted, kind of silly. And Louden eventually beats Shute which is a turnabout as if George Custer won. But don't forget the picture had a very hot Linda Fiorentino which made up for a few gaps in the believability quotient."
books,17 of 17,5.0,An apt analysis of the addiction process,"I first read this book maybe ten years ago, shortly after I quit drinking.  At the time I was at a loss in terms of understanding what I had put myself through, and why.  When I read the book, it gave me an apt context in which to view my addiction.  Every year or two I read it again, and always gain fresh insights.  It surprised me greatly to read a few reviews here which put Nakken's work down.  One person said the book was ""useless"" because it's too ""theoretical"".  Funny, but I didn't find that to be the case.  It definitely offered up thoughts on what I was going through which proved quite practical.  Someone else implied Nakken's book is too contingent on the tenets of AA.  I didn't find that to be the case either.  It's a paradigm for understanding addiction which stands alone from the 12 steps.  If people choose to use it in tandem with them, so be it.  But it's not essential to what he says.  Deng Xiaoping once said, ""It doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.""  Such is the case here.  Some might feel he's too ""theoretical"", or take issue with his concept of the ""addictive personality"".  Say what you want -- the man knows what he's talking about.  He offers his readers some keen insights which are quite useful in understanding their own addictive issues, or those of someone close to them.  I did NOT read this for a class.  I read it because I had a problem, wanted to understand it, and when I was finished I actually did.  As far as I'm concerned, Nakken's book was an excellent buy, and it's paid for itself maaaaany times over."
books,15 of 15,5.0,An Extraordinary Exhibition of Showbills,"If you ever have a chance for a collector to show his collection, you run the risk of being terribly bored.  Unless you yourself collect stamps, coins, thimbles, Hummel figurines, or Corvettes, you are unlikely to sympathize with the delight the collector takes in his hoard.  Ricky Jay is a fascinating man; he is a master magician, a historian of show business (especially of novelty acts), and an actor in David Mamet's movies.  He collects something few others do: showbills for the jugglers, magicians, animal acts, ventriloquists, and other eccentric and novelty performances through almost four centuries.   Don't worry, it is far from boring.  Around eighty of his specimens are on display in a large format book, _Extraordinary Exhibitions: The Wonderful Remains of an Enormous Head, the Whimsiphusicon & Death to the Savage Unitarians_ (Quantuck Lane Press).  The broadsides are funny and beautiful, and Jay's learned and enthusiastic commentary about each one is on the page facing each specimen.  It is all thoroughly entertaining, and like any show advertising, the posters make you wonder if the acts are really as described.  There is so much verbal and graphic hyperbole on display here that a bit of incredulity is only sensible, but still: who, if confronted by an announcement for Signor Cappelli and his Learned Cats, with assurances that after he introduces his cats to the audience, they will ""beat a drum, turn a spit, grind knives, strike upon an anvil, roast coffee, ring bells, set a piece of Machinery in motion to grind rice in the Italian manner with many other astonishing exercises"", who, I say, would let incredulity overcome a wish to get a peek at the show?"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Escape to Paradise!,"This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure.

This one earned its 5 stars!"

There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it"

Before the discovery, they announce their intention to board the boat, only to find two Columbians who speak little and look guilty as sin. The Captain and crew have the presence of mind to record on film permanently what the encountered. They nearly gag at what they find. Contrary to usual procedure, they create a ""justice at sea"" bogus trial based on some ancient mariner's manual. It is just the right scenario to create fear in their prisoners which extracts a confession from them that the Coast Guard believes will stand up in court and get them prosecuted."

The one fault this book has starts in the first chapter when it states &quot;Make sure you avoid these YGBK's&quot;.  My question to you is what is that.  I have thoroughly looked for the meaning of this acronym and have come up empty.  If anyone could provide some light please do
books,1 of 1,5.0,Emotional Rollercoaster,I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  The author provides insight into the lives of two inner city youth.  It makes you question our society and what we can do to help individuals who live in poverty.  Poverty is not a choice but rather a sad reality that effects far too many of America's youth.  Please read this book!  It will change the way you think

Pages and entire sections of pages have fallen out, the back cover and last 5 pages are detached and the pages are yellowed. So what am I doing about it? Buying another one, of course! This time, I'm splurging on the hardcover edition which I hope will last longer. It is such a wonderful cookbook with intructions on everything from how to boil water to butchering a turtle for soup. Any cooking question you have will be answered by this book - it is wonderful! I was going to buy the new revised edition, but after reading many reviews on the Amazon website, I decided to heed the advice and stick to the original. Highly recommended cookbook!"

books,1 of 1,4.0,Cat's Cradle - Vonnegut's Absurd Masterpiece,"Kurt Vonnegut's ""Cat's Cradle"" is the story of a man, Jonah, who is writing about the ""end of the world,"" or the day when the atom bomb was dropped.  His work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position.  The story features an imaginative religion, a scientific potion, and a far off society as part of Vonnegut's many bizarre episodes.  Jonah, researches the ""father of the atom bomb"" and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped.  Seemingly against his will, Jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true.  His journeys ultimately land him, along with the children, on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own."

So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates.

The best chapter is the one on what to  do if your dog sniffs people's crotches!  The author's writing is  entertaining, clear and quite funny.  I have given this book  to over a  dozen friends who got new puppies and they all swear by it!  Read this  book!!"
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Well written, but be prepared for grim","Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen."

In some ways the plot is predictable as all Alex Rider stories are - except for the ending surprise in Scorpia.  The action is fast paced and is perfect for a teenage boy reader. Girls who enjoy spy stories will like it too. It is hard to put the book down."

books,1 of 2,4.0,Very good characters and highly readable...m,"While the plotline is routine and almost predictable, Pelecanos makes it work.  I love his characters--both Lorenzo, the ex con trying to go straight, and Rachel, the Parole Officer trying to get straight, are very likeable and sympathetic characters.  Their depth carries you through a less-than-moving plotline.  I will be reading more of Pelecanos' work."

books,,5.0,Eye opener,"This was such a well written book, that you would think an adult wrote. To know that a young lady wrote this was truly an inspiration for all those young people with writing dreams such as Anne's. Anne and her family went through such a hard two years and still remained hopeful and positive. This book really gives a great picture of what the Jewish community went through, all the unjust moves against them. It made me gain more respect for ALL religions and races. This book makes you wish that more help was sent to these people. We can never understand all the hardships The Franks went through, but we can help those going through similar persecution."
books,2 of 2,5.0,"Stunning, Readable and Erudite","This book is one-of-kind: fiercely intelligent, playfully readable, uncompromisingly intellectual, technically dazzling and more. Byatt succedes in being able to so deftly straddle that razor-sharp boundary between writing a good book and making great literature that it almost makes me feel sorry for most other writers. The language snaps, the story strides confidently along, the characters develop in such a way that they seem to bloom organically rather than to be creations of a singule/ar mind and the plot has just enough twists, turns and surprises to make it an unlikely page-turner. Extra praise should be lain for Byatt's ability to perfectly summon Victorian poetic and epistolic forms and make them unite seamlessly with the book's wider, Postmodernist tone and philosophy. Of course, no book is without its faults, and this one probably has more than I would like to admit, but generally I found this to be an amazing book that I would recommend without hesitation."

Marilla adopts two mischievous twins and Mrs. Rachel Lynde moves in. So life is never dull for Anne at the school house or at Green Gables. You could read it on its own, but I recommend you read Anne of Green Gables first"

Osipa guides you through the creation of numerous plausible blend shapes and helps you avoid the most common errors. Before I bought this, I was doing everything wrong. The range of emotion that this system is capable of expressing is near total, and certainly enough for any project I can think of short of a major motion picture."

The book hurts me -- tears me to small pieces -- but somehow it sets me free. It says the word that I've been trying to pronounce for so long. It tells me everything I am, and have been, and may be, unsparingly...I don't know why I cry over it so much. It's too -- something-or-other -- to stand. I've been sitting here tonight, reading it aloud, with the tears streaming down my face..."" -- Deems Taylor, in a letter dated December 12, 1920."

It may not be as big as the original cookbook, but the recipes in here can save you time and make your code more correct."

books,2 of 3,2.0,Even if I didn't know this book was a farce...,"it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore"

This means that, up until now, I've focused 100% of my energy on developing my craft and felt my art should speak for itself.  I found most self-promoters to be pretty obnoxious and a big turn-off.  But somehow, the author manages to show how promotion can actually be creative and fun.  Silber gives so many examples that there's bound to be something that will match your personal style.  The best thing is that every time I read from this book -- I find myself coming up with ideas of my own -- and THAT, in itself, has made it worth every penny. Thanks, Lee!!"

books,2 of 3,4.0,Scary story of destructive weather,"Isaac's Storm by Erik Larsen is a compelling read.  It's the story of the events leading up to the 1900 hurricane that devastated Galveston, Texas.  The time was so different.  Today we're starting to see the results of our indiscriminate destruction of the environment in the melting of the polar caps and global warming.  In 1900, meteorologists were of the belief that someday they would be able to control the weather, stop hail, start rain, there was nothing they couldn't do.  And they hoarded their responsibility and priviledge from any who might disagree.  Into this political climate blew a storm that would change not only an entire city, but National Weather Bureau, but especially the people who lived through it.  Larsen does an excellent job of building the timeline by focusing on just a few people to tell the tragedy.  Occasionally he uses the tired technique of ending a chapter on a cliffhanger to heighten and maintain interest.  It's not necessary; the story is powerful enough with cheesy literary devices.  My only other complaint about the book is the lack of photographs.  While it sounds gruesome, pictures of the city before and after the hurricane would help heighten the story.  The Isaac in the title is Isaac Cline, head of the National Weather Bureau at the time who ignored the signs of the city's impending doom and suffered for it personally in many ways.  This is a horrible story that still holds lessons for us today"

Whether you like him or not, in my opinion, everyone should read his books in order to get a general yet very insightful view of current political affairs and their historical and philosophical backgrounds. His unflinching motivation to unearth the truths behind many political events, bold character, and extraordinary ability to see and make sensible connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena is absolutely outstanding."
books,16 of 21,5.0,Dennett is amazing - a quick review for the religious (as I used to be that way myself),"Dennett's metaphor for Darwinism is that acts like a Universal Acid upon everything it touches--and that means literally everything.  It eats into the foundations of the hard sciences, the various and rather less solid underpinnings of the social sciences, the sometimes ridiculous and sometimes incisive branches of psychology, and the claims made as to any potential (though often simply vaporous and intentionally obscure) philosophical or theological `truths' in the round.  There is nothing that it does not take a substantial bite from, and that fact cannot be avoided unless you merely opt for silly, ignorant avoidance, i.e., you either refute or run for cover!  Bravo Dennett, then, as somebody needed to say this as loudly as possible.  ALL the work we have done to understand ourselves and our origins needs to be refigured in the light of Darwin, and thankfully Dennett is both brave enough and smart enough to take the heat and rebound the criticism from numerous sources.  Anyway, here are the facts as offered:"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Have Your Cake and Eat it Too,"This book is not only chalk full of wonderful knowledge on how to read your bible, it is also gives you some great basic biblical advice. If you are often overcome with the thought of reading a book older than dirt, than this is a book to finger through to help you get a better handle on it.  A book well worth the read."
books,17 of 70,1.0,"Chomsky is a lunatic, take with a grain of salt","I picture Chomsky in a sunless, cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers, surrounded only by walls of his own clippings.  Yes, his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world.  Not everything is a conspiracy theory, and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture.  The world is too random for all similar events to be related.  But when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts, the result is going to be nonsense.  I respect Chomsky's right to say what he thinks, and as a liberal I often find myself agreeing with him (but for vastly different reasons).  What I do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel, when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works.  Throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems.  To me, he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that 9-11 was perpetrated by the U.S. government."

Starting with a seemingly sad unconnnected event (the suicide of a client Kenzie only spoke to once, and then forgot to respond to her phone message), Kenzie begins a search for truth.  It will lead him back from the depressive edge of insanity that resulted from the events of 'Gone,Baby,Gone' and once again into the arms of Angela Gennaro (hopefully for good)."
books,10 of 10,4.0,LIfe at the Top,"You read a book like this to get a feel for what's it would be like to be considered the GOLD STANDARD in electoral politics. Nobody in modern times has had the success or the good fortune to be on the winning side of so many Presidential elections. One of Baker's competitors is James Carville, the man who more than any other, helped Bill Clinton to defeat George HW Bush and his manager James A. Baker III in 1992. It was Carville who referred to Baker as the Gold Standard."

Though clearly a masterpiece (there has been talk about Pamuk as a potential Nobelist), it is by no means an easy read."
books,,5.0,Great Biography of a Great Man and Leader,"After reading the book ""Leadership on Lincoln,"" I wanted to learn more about the life of this fascinating figure in American history.  This title provides many details about the man, his many tragedies and failures, and his ultimate success as a leader.  The author does well in not standing in the way of his subject -- he simply unfolds the story before the reader's eyes.  This volume is rather large at 600 pages, but the read is an enjoyable one.  For anyone wanting to discover a thorough treatment of the life of Abraham Lincoln, this book is an excellent investment"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Bud vs. Marlon,"The paradox that is Marlon Brando has always been the allure for me, besides the obvious brillance as an actor. I'm far from alone in my opinion. I think it was appropriate that he didn't write about his marriages and children. Such things, as we know, are private matters too painful and complex. Confessionals and tell-all autobiographies are not interesting anyway, and rarely do they reveal the true character of their subjects. I learned a lot about who Brando was just by reading his description of autumn leaves in Libertyville and the night sky over Tetiaroa."

Flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point.  He relies on, for example, what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs.  Look at the footnotes in Chapter 4.  I'm sorry but this is like looking for a Leno's Jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement."

Instead, she decides to go with two of her friends to help renovate an old lighthouse they have bought.  In the intriguing setting of Alaska's Five Finger Lighthouse, Sue Henry creates another well-written mystery.  Jessie looks forward to joining a crew of volunteer workers, but on her way to the lighthouse, she becomes acquainted with a young woman named Karen who is running from a man who has abused her in the past.  Desperate for a place to go where she will not be found, Karen accompanies Jessie to the island where they are to work on the lighthouse.  Soon a dead body is discovered, and the workers know that they have taken on more than they bargained for.  As the communication system to and from the island is cut off, the situation becomes more serious.  Sue Henry's fans will enjoy this latest addition to the Jessie Arnold Mystery Series"

books,8 of 9,5.0,into the mind of a genius of antiquity,"This is a remarkable document.  It is at once a manual on military strategy, on effective management of his troops, and on the psychology of the enemy.  But it is also a history, with smatterings of anthropology, sometimes our only source on a vanished pre-Roman way of life in what became France.  Finally, and most difficult to grasp, there is a political subtext, in which Caesar is communicating with both allies and rivals in Rome, advancing his career while advising future leaders on proper conduct.  Why did he mention certain things?  What did he omit?  What political image (or self-consciously enduring myth) was he creating for himself?  There are few antique documents as fascinating and to boot it is a literary masterpiece of clear exposition and rapidly moving narrative.  Once you read it - and it must be read carefully and with references to other sources - you will have no doubt that Caesar was one of the greatest leaders of all time:  afterall, his name is the basis for Tzar as well as Kaiser!"

books,,4.0,RICE,"This is a very well done book on one of the most beautiful college campuses in America.  The architecture is spectacular, architect Cram created a style for Rice, it was unique to Rice, it is an amalgamation of Byzantine and Venician styles and it suits the Houston climate perfectly.  Through the years subsequent architects have created their own interpretation of Cram's architecture, for the most part it has worked.  Though the lamented Fondren Library terminates the axis and is an unwelcome intrusion, but it is soon to be completly rebuilt so hopefully it will better suit Cram's buildings on the main quad.  The setting of the university is breathtaking, I recommend anyone visiting Houston to take time to stroll the campus, it is symply stunning.  Stephen Fox is one of the foremost authorities on Houston architecture, so it is quite fitting that he authored this book.  High recommended, beautiful campus and architecture, the crown jewel of Texas higher education and that comes from a die hard Texas Ex"

Now that we have the technology to simplify communication, it's time to upgrade our own communication skills to avoid the pitfalls and re-focus upon what we're trying to say. Kevin Ryan not only gives us the tools to improve our writing but he introduces us to successful people who already have.  I write back cover promotional pieces for a book publisher and I've cut hours from the amount of time it takes to create new, fresh and clear copy. Here's a book that's right for the times"
books,1 of 1,5.0,A Time to Kill,A Time to Kill and The Broker are my two favs from Grisham.  Suspense is the name of the game.   I like books that make me read them straight through because they're so suspense filled. Another great novel is Deadly Behavior by Dee Sullivan.

Oh, and also, Pynchon was not only robbed of a Pulitzer Prize, but also (so far) of a highly deserved Nobel Prize (also true of John Ashbery)"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Outstanding Comments of Legendary Publisher/ Author/ Etc.!!,"From his early days at Columbia, starting out with the Liveright Publishers in the 1920's, and buying into the Modern Library Classics, this is without doubt the best look at publishing I've ever read! The amusing story of how a special copy of Ulysses came across the Atlantic, and into the hands of US Customs is worth the price of the book! Add to that, hilarious yarns, like meeting with Gerturde Stein & her Sidekick Alice, featuring the hilarious promotion of their book so it could ""compete"" with the hot new book FOREVER AMBOR ,and its even hotter author K. Windor makes for some real fun. Mr. Cerf even wrote a short comment in some of Ms. Stein's books admitting he could not always figure out what they were about. A trip to London to meet Bernard Shaw is also good for some laughs. His comments on many other ""Literati"", including Saroyan, Faulkner, O' Hara, Ayn Rand,Wittaker Chambers, etc. plus general comments on the state of the world are all top. In short, a must read for anyone of all ages, even if you don't care too much about writing and publishing!"

Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States."

I don't recall there being alot of complicated or harsh language. So it's basically a children's fairy-tale with some adult content. If you like children's fairy tales, you will love Stardust. It is very well done, and the imagery is fantastic. Although they're probably not the best books for comparision, I'd say that if you're an adult yet you still enjoy reading books like Ella Enchanted and the Neverending Story, you'll like this one."

Get Gilberts or Emanuels or just use your class notes on this stuff though. Also: if your professor has a slightly different view on the rules (even if it's just a difference in semantics) use your prof's rules when working the Examples. Writing out your answers to the Examples throughout the semester will solidify your knowledge and you won't have to struggle to memorize the elements of each rule at the end of the semester"

Recipes that include large amounts of butter, cream, cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty.  I'll bet they taste wonderful, however. Creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible.  Also I resent having to use Paula's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients, eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them."

books,11 of 12,5.0,Book Summary -- Banker to the Poor,"Founded in Bangladesh by Muhammad Yunus in 1976, the Grameen Bank is one of the most successful attempts ever to employ capitalist principles to achieve social goals. By approaching poverty from a different tact, Grameen seeks to reconcile the inequalities inherent in capitalism by mobilizing the ""informal sector"" of society-the self-employed poor. By addressing the root cause of poverty (i.e. lack of access to capital) Yunus has succeeded where many others have failed. Often, well-intentioned governments fail to solve the issue of poverty because of ""misguided development"" policies and bloated bureaucracies. Similarly, many international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, have failed because their heavy-handed top-down approach excludes those most in need of aid. Yunus writes, ""I have always believed that the elimination of poverty from the world is a matter of will"" (248). Grameen succeeds where others fail because they appeal to the most downtrodden, the poorest of the poor-the bottom 50% of those already below the poverty line."
books,0 of 2,5.0,Principle Driven Business,"For me, this book wasn't primarily about Wal-Mart.  It was about a man who took his principles to work with him and became incredibly significant.  In a world severly lacking in principle driven living, it shines as a beacon.  Here's an example:"
books,10 of 11,5.0,I'VE ENJOYED THIS ONE OVER THE YEARS,"First I must admit to a certain bias here.  I travel a lot, I travel with a dog as a companion and I enjoy reading this particular author. I was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date. I can relate to this work!  That being said, this is one of those books that I have reread several times over the years, and year after year, I find that Steinbeck's observations contunue to be relevant.  This is a very easy reading book.  I do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though, that this is NOT a novel(despite what his son said)!  It is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author's eyes.  It is interpreted through the author's past expierences and how he preceives the world.  I am sure that any ten (or one hundred) people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten (or one hundred) different stories and interpretations of those stories. I shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations...others I did not.  That is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read, or better yet, talk to others, and agree or disagree, enjoy their views.  I certainly cannot fault the author's usage of language, syntax and organization.  It is all good solid Steinbeck. This is one of those books that can be read on several levels.  You can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in America, or, as I do, you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author.  As a side note:  I do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring.  I can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies, T.V. etc. of this day and age.  I might suggest though, that you give it another read in a few years.  Perhaps you will look at it differently.  I know I have expierence that with other works by different authors.  All in all, recommend this one highly."

books,,5.0,The Arab-Israeli Wars: Revised Edition,The book is an excellant study of small war tactics through Israel's occupation of Lebanon. While I don't agree with the U.S. allied with Israel; this is still an outstanding overview of the way Israel fights its wars.
books,,5.0,I love this book,"I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books.  The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing.  I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia.  You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone"
books,4 of 4,2.0,A disappointment.,"I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A ""Left Behind"" book"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Decent Week by Week Guide,"This book is almost entirely week by week description, so the information is detailed.  I especially liked the Dad Tips that are included with each week.  There is also a tiny section on labor and lists of common events for the first several post partum weeks.  I liked the simple writing style, but I often did not find the extra information for each week relevent to what I was going through at the time.  I prefer You and Your Baby Pregnancy: your ultimate week by week by Dr. Laura Riley"
books,2 of 2,4.0,what happens when friends fall apart do to crazy situations,This book is very touching you get caught up with daves character.This book pulls you in and keeps you on the edge waiting and wondering what would happen next. It takes a turning point when one of the friends gets kidnapped by two man claiming to be officers. During that time they fall apart at lease one of them does. They lose there friendship  after the incident and become friends again but not to the same strenght they did before.Until another problem occurs then all of them come back into contact with each other again.It makes you think how far does friendship go? Alot of people that had friends when they where younger dont anymore. So i ask my self a question how strong is a friendship after a traggic situation. This book tells more info then the movie did and i like that. I feel bad for one of the friends cause after all that happened to him he was different
books,4 of 4,5.0,infallible,"based on the strength of the Kingdom Come graphic novel illustrated gorgeously by Alex Ross, I picked up this gem of story-telling. The chapters contained within the book are treasures of narrative that will keep one's attention without any trouble at all. I am a fan of the X-Men from 'that other Comic Book company'. But I get too caught up in the megalomania of those stories that I realized how much I saw that superheroes dealing with common criminals and situations are as much, if not more, compelling."

We started it on a Saturday so we could do the water fast on the weekend - very good idea.  I was amazed how I had not problem with hunger and even though I have to watch my blood sugar level there was no problem.  We felt so great when we were done.  This is something I think we will do at least once a year
books,7 of 9,5.0,More books like this needed,"Lies Across America: What our Historic Sites Get Wrong is an excellent book by James Loewen. He starts first with the western half of the United States since most history textbooks start with the eastern side. All of the information about historical markers is broken up into small sections for easy reading. Loewen proceeds to give state-by-state accounts of historical markers and their errors or in some cases their silliness. Many of the markers honor people as heroes who were in fact overt racists. Other markers are notorious for telling one side of the story. Most of the markers in the south dealing with the Confederacy are found to slant towards confederate sentiments or just to omit what really happened at historic confederate sites. We also find out that many markers dealing with Native Americans would refer to them as savages or other racist terms. In many instances I was appalled by the honoring of people like Jeffrey Amherst in Massachusetts who intentionally initiated the spread of smallpox among Native Americans to exterminate them from the landscape. Loewen also points out our country has never been able to come to terms with gay or lesbian leaders and honor them. You can take a tour of Willa Cather's original home in Nebraska but never once hear anything mentioned about her being a lesbian. Another instance of outright silliness is when Plantation homes talk endlessly about silverware while you tour them but fail to mention anything to do with who built the homes, did the work there, and were held in bondage to the owners. These are just some of the things that you'll find contained in this book."
books,6 of 12,1.0,Disappointment,I read Cesar Millan's book and thought that this bood would be similiar in information and instruction.  I was completely wrong.

books,2 of 8,4.0,A Great Alice,"This production of Alice in Wonderland is pretty fabulous.  I loved it as a child.  It has a lovely mix of classic stars (Sammy Davis Junior, Imogene Coca) and flavors-of-the-month from the mid-80s (Pat Morita, John Stamos).  It would make a great DVD set"
books,13 of 13,5.0,Cerf's Up!!!,"When all of us who are now officially Older Than Dirt were growing up back in the 1960's, we usually aspired to be one of three particular men of achievement. For those of us with an athletic bent, Mickey Mantle was the man of choice. For those adventurers and dreamers among us, John Glenn appeared to offer the perfect life. Finally, for us bookish sorts, Bennett Cerf, publisher of Random House, panelist on ""What's My Line,"" author of some of the worst puns ever written, and all around man about town, was who we aspired to be. This book is in essence his memoirs, told in oral history format just a short time before his unexpected death in 1971. He describes in detail why he was able to grow Random House at such a rapid rate: in his day, the book business was a stuffy one, and no publisher worth his salt would dream of lowering himself to seek out new authors. Bennett, being young, foolish, and very intelligent, would travel to wherever these authors lived and impress them with his obvious wit and sincerity. The sheer number and weight of authors whose service he was able to acquire through these means was absolutely staggering: Eugene O'Neill, James Joyce, Robinson Jeffers, Gertrude Stein, and Bill Styron, to name a very few. Through his liberal editing policies, he was even able to publish authors whose ideas he completely disagreed with, such as Ayn Rand. Some, like playwright Moss Hart, became lifelong friends. Although New Yorkers have long thought of their city as the center of the universe, Bennett's long and storied career made many believe it was true. The reader will enjoy his chatty, breezy style time and again, as a reminder that at one time, in the world of books and publishing, one man truly made a difference"

books,,5.0,Feyman Lecture On Physics - A great journey toward Physics,"I purchased the Feyman Lectures on Physics because I always wanted have this material to prepare my lectures. I did my graduation in French Universities and the physics lectures there are something diferent from the Anglo Saxon way. I always wanted to take advantage of my formation and the fact that I have acess to Physics books from the US or UK to have another look to Physics. For this Feyman Lectures are essential. The clarity and the originality of these lectures continue to inspire generation of teacher. Sometime I regret that the mathematical formalism is not more present, but this is due my formation."
books,,1.0,Utterly Bad,"I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and ""Into the Storm"" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex."
books,10 of 10,5.0,"Excellent book, but not for the hack",The book is probably the best reference I've seen. What it isn't is a cookbook for beginners. I'd recommend it for someone that already knows their way around a kitchen and wants a source for myriad (well only 5100) ideas
books,22 of 22,5.0,This book is a companion with my Bible,"December 1986 my family presented me with this book. I enjoy readings of William Barclay, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Carlo Carretto, Richard Foster, Carl Jung, C. S. Lewis, Henri J. Nouwen, Mother  Teresa, Elton Trueblood, John Wesley, to name a few. But to have writings  by these great authors compiled in one book is unimaginable. On top of that  there are the lyrics of some of the most well known and loved hymns  included in this book. There are monthly retreat models that can be done  individually or with a group. The story ""A Doll of Salt"" by  Anthony Bloom is a wonderful simile of our developing relationship with  God. I have highlighted, written in the margins, and dogeared so many pages  that I had to get a second copy because the first one is falling apart (and  it was the leather bound copy). The readings are so inspiring and uplifting  as well as thought provoking for the layperson as well as the ordained  minister. If you are going to get this book I encourage you to get the  leather bound for you will discover you will use it on a daily basis along  with your Bible"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Eye Opening,"Jonathan Kozol's Amazing Grace is an enlightening, non-fiction account of life in the South Bronx. To write this book, Kozol visited to the area hundreds of times, speaking with and establishing relationships with residents as well as exploring, and getting to know the area himself. The final product is a compilation of conversations with some amazing people and his own thoughts and reflections, beautifully woven together. This book addresses numerous social issues effecting New York's poorest areas including violence, poverty, unemployment, drug addiction, HIV/AIDS, inadequate schools, orphaned children, and deplorable living conditions."
books,18 of 18,5.0,A finely tuned book with thought provoking exercises.,"More like a workbook, we admire the way this book breaks away from the usual war mode and into the strategy realm.  Sun Tzu, though it does show you how to prepare for battle, prefers that war is not implemented if not  for preservation's sake.  This book's print quality could be better but it  is very well organized with profound analyses. Broken down verse by verse  and separated by each area of interaction (personal, interpersonal, group)  you can tell the author really took the effort to have the reader  understand and apply every concept.  Wow. You'll be glad you bought it.   Sonshi.co"
books,4 of 5,5.0,Stretches the subject matter of fiction to its limits,"I have read sevral of McCarthy's other novels. His best ones stretch something to the limit.  In &lt;Blood Meridian&gt; it was violence.  Here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings.  Lester Ballard is the ultimate user.  Other people exist for him only to meet his needs, even if they are dead.  I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.  I don't think the title is meant to be ironic.  I think we are meant to see that even Lester Ballard really is a child of God"
books,2 of 10,2.0,depressing,"This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time"

It was an entertaining book to read.  I particularly liked the timeline that she did following the main characters through years to develop the story line.  It was also exciting to watch the two romantic heroes to ""narrowly"" miss each other over the years and to see them finally met."

books,41 of 48,5.0,Insightful and entertaining,"As a fan of Shakespeare (both on the stage/screen and written page), I have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright.  First there was Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare, which was a well-written commentary on the historical contexts of the plays.  Then, there was Harold Bloom's Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, a scholarly work offset by a tone of high-toned intellectual snobbery and condescension.  Now, there is Shakespeare After All, a work that fits between these two in quality."
books,0 of 1,4.0,"Gentle read, enlightening content","As a newer student of history I'm fascinated by all of the research and reconstruction that goes into putting together biographies of some of our early leaders.

At first they just loved looking at the colorful letters, then it moved on to giggling at the ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom!"" verse. Now, they actually flip through the pages and try to read the story themselves. They will actually babble the rhythm, with a word sprinkled here and there."
books,2 of 3,2.0,Not-So-Wildlife,"At 163 pages, ""Wildlife"" is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched Montana landscape.  The biggest problem is not so much the story, but the way the story is told.  In some cases, the impersonal first-person narrator works, as in ""The Great Gatsby"", but in others like ""Wildlife"" or ""A Prayer for Owen Meaney"", the narrator is such a nonentity that they don't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other, more important characters."

Now, if you're not familiar with the concept that your internal world creates your external world, that's an 'out there' idea... Yes, parts of the book are redundant... and I'm not into all the spiritual stuff... but that's okay, because the concepts are simple and simply explained. Not to mention uplifting and inspiring.

books,4 of 4,5.0,just a brilliant book,"In this collection of essays, Nancy Fraser makes equally strong political and scholarly contributions.  Arguing that &quot;postsocialism&quot;  leaves the left lacking in utopian vision, she begins by attempting to  formulate such a vision.  Rather than choosing to focus on the goal of  recognition or that of redistribution (put another way, on cultural or  social issues), she argues that any effective leftist politics must work  for both simultaneously.  Throughout the book she maintains this balance  between cultural and social concerns and strategies for change.  The result  is both politically inspiring and intellectually stimulating"

books,43 of 44,5.0,Useful Cookbook for Ovo Lacto Vegetarians,"Though I am 23, older than the intended audience, my Mom bought me this book as a present. I was thrilled with it. Lauren Butts has created a fun and easy cookbook for anyone. I love the layout of the cookbook, it is divided into sections, and I enjoyed her nutritional info in the front of the book. Maybe it will inspire more teens to go veg.I found this cookbook full of great meatless recipes. I must warn strict vegetarians and vegans however, that most recipes contain dairy products, or eggs. There is a great recipe for &quot;Nathan's Blueberry Breakfast Cupcakes&quot;, that is easy to make and tastes like store bought. However when I tried to get my three year old neighbor to eat one, he refused in horror. Other recipes that I have enjoyed making include: apricot chimichangas, Thai tofu Veggie Wrap-yum, Burrito Roll up, Veggie Pitas (Tastes the same as Wendy's veggie pita), Layered Nacho Salad, Mock Caesar Salad (in case you didn't know, Caesar Salad dressing is typically made with ANCHOVIES-fish=meat), Chilled Berry Soup-this is a fabulous recipe I made last summer when berries were plentiful, it is totally tasty and makes a great meal, TASTY FLATBREAD PIZZA WITH ARTICHOKE HEARTS!! This pizza was so unbelievably tasty, I have always been a bit wary of artichoke hearts, they just look kind of disgusting you know, but I was so shocked to discover their delicious taste!! Veggie Quesadillas were also fabulous. SPAGHETTI PIE is indeed a great dish, and I like to make it when serving non-vegetarians. It has been a hit with everyone so far. Tofu McNuggets are the absolute bomb. These recipes are only a fraction of the great ones in this book. I would highly recommend it to parents of new young vegetarians, or college students like myself who don't have that much time to cook.  Some have opined that this book is full of recipes that are fattening, but I think most know, that us vegetarians are a mostly lean lot, and I can personally attest that the recipes aren't fattening. Thanks Lauren for creating a great book, it is indeed an oasis as far as Veg cookbooks go. Its great to have a cookbook that isn't full of really long, hard to find, expensive ingredients"
books,3 of 4,4.0,"Lots of science, not enough earthquake","A Crack in the Edge of the World by Simon Winchester is about the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.  This being the centennial of the event, there have been a lot of books produced about it, but I had heard good things about Winchester and his writing, so this is the one I picked.  I'll have to find another one to read that has the info I was looking for.  I was looking for a book filled with stories about the people who lived through it and how it affected their lives.  I wanted to read about families separated and united, romances and businesses.  I wanted to read about human emotion.  This is not the book for that, but that's not to say that it doesn't have merit.  I learned about plate tectonics, the formation of the world, the settlement of the American West, earthquakes in the Midwest, and much more, but only 50-75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in San Francisco, and once the fire it put out, the book quickly ends.  There is a little discussion about the rebuilding, but mostly just to disparage the effort.  Winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of Latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling.  His research is excellent, and I did learn quite a bit, enough to sleep well in my stable state of Wisconsin and ensure that I'll never visit California"
books,6 of 7,4.0,Modern Machiavelli,"I thought this was an excellent book and it certainly describes how to achieve power but only to a limited extent.  In the final analysis you must ACTUALLY know what you are doing and you must have the support of others.  Every star sets just as it rises and anyone who thinks that they will never suffer reverses or need the support of others lives in the dream world described in this book.  All of these techniques are real and based on my experience and observation they work, but what is missing from this book is any word of caution.  At least Machiavellie gives you some of the downsides, which this book lacks. This is the ""law of the west"" and just like the old west, there is ALWAYS a faster gun and the person who has practiced these techniques will find himself in real trouble when he meets that faster gun.  With over 30 years in the corporate world I know first hand that ruthless people get ruthless treatment and in the end all you have is your reputation and the support of those who believe in you.  If you use these techniques without regard for others or your reputation in the end it will cost you.  However, these techniques are real and they do work, but I think they should be applied sparingly"

books,4 of 7,5.0,A solid record,"This account of the Wars of Israel from the War of Independence is written with fairness and a real attention to the facts. Herzog can fault Israel, and is aware of mistakes but points out to the essentially defensive character of the Jewish state's major military actions. As a participant in the War of Independence and as the major commentator and in fact ' national spokesman' in the 1967 war he well understands Israeli society from inside. He has great military knowledge and shows this in detailed explanations of the battle. Considering however the tremendous drama of the events involved the work is a bit less humanly moving than it could have been had he written more personally about the major characters involved"

books,,5.0,Disney Fan,"I am reading the book right now and am enjoying all the little tid bits of information.  The book is easy to navigate through with it being set around days of the year.  Though, it is easy to forget that the author is talking about a specific day being ""opening day"" for a movie, someone's ""birthday"", etc"
books,5 of 5,5.0,"Confidentially speaking, it's a great read","Browsing the bookstore's true-crime section last month in search of a page-turner I hadn't already read, I spied an unfamiliar jacket: Paul LaRosa's TACOMA CONFIDENTIAL.  The synopsis was riveting.  I only hoped the reading would be half as good as the compelling details promised."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Leave Room In Your Life For The Absurd,"Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Worth a Second Look...,"I first picked this up a year ago and didn't like it. I think that's because I'd just read his powerful autobiographical novels Post Office and Ham on Rye and wanted more of the same. Pulp, Bukowski's last novel, was completed shortly before his death in 1994 and is more a work of fantasy--an absurd detective tale written in classic hardboiled private eye style. It's a pageturner, and I'd love to see it turned into a movie. It starts when Lady Death hires private dick Nick Belane to ascertain the identity of someone she thinks is Celine, who has somehow escaped her grasp. Bukowski's Celine is hilarious, a master of the put-down. More clients follow, in the best film noir tradition, but with bizarre and humorous twists. Belane's association with Lady Death proves beneficial a number of times, but it is not without its price. I couldn't put this down and the ending is a gutwrencher. Running gags like Belane's ""high"" fee ($6 an hour) and his inability to get served in bars without a hassle prove Buk's masterful comic touch, while slice of life digressions take the reader places few writers go. For instance, a space alien laments: ""The earth. Smog, murder, the poisoned air, the poisoned water, the poisoned food, the hatred, the hopelessness, everything. The only beautiful thing about the earth is the animals and now they are being killed off, soon they will be gone except for pet rats and race horses. It's so sad, no wonder you drink so much."" Dedicated to ""bad writing,"" Pulp is anything but"

books,,4.0,A well written story that will keep you up,"I got this book unabridged on CD.  I would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects. My wife and I usually have our own books that we'll read together, but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too, even though she wasn't listening to it to begin with. Upon discovering I had listened to some without her, my wife was like, ""what? You listened to it without me?!"" My response was, ""I didn't even think you were listening to it."" That's how hooked you can get on this story."

books,2 of 2,4.0,Best of Nora,"First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read"
books,0 of 4,5.0,A Great Read on Burma,"This is an engrossing memoir. Detailed. Synchs with other things I have read of Burma. I kind of think some of it is a bit, um, self-serving or fictional. A story on steroids. But, with that caveat, enjoy this book and keep it in your Burma collection"

books,3 of 3,5.0,Jared Brown on Moss Hart,"Having recently discovered Jared Brown I have become a fan of his writing.  ""Moss Hart: A Prince of the Theater"" was a welcome addition to his list of biographies.  Deeply researched and well written, it was a joy to read and a font of information.  Hart was an extremely interesting man, and his relationship with his wife, Kitty Carlisle, was heartwarming; in fact Carlisle is every bit as interesting as Hart.  Brown gives insight into the art of play writing, the emense amount of work involved and the talent of Hart and his early partner, George Kaufman.  From writing Hart went to directing and was even more successful.  A gem of a book."
books,4 of 5,4.0,Still use it as a resource,"I'm a speech therapist and have given this book to families to encourage them to get intensive early intervention. It's been a great tool as far as that is concerned, in showing families an 'up close and personal' account of what intervention can do. I read the book myself a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. Most of the reviews here are from people who have an autistic child in their lives, however, I would recommend it to anyone as an autobiography. It really flows and the emotional involvement you feel with the family is made stronger by knowing these are real people, not fictional characters."

books,,4.0,Insider's account of how  Wal-Mart does business,"Author Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's retired Vice Chairman and COO, writes passionately about the company its founder, the late Sam Walton and its corporate culture. Once dubbed 'keeper of the culture,' he is not here to write a balanced, objective corporate biography. Instead, his admiration and respect for Walton and Wal-Mart shine from every line. He examines the company's workings from its humble beginnings to its rapid, phenomenal expansion. Soderquist describes Wal-Mart's commitment to its customers and employees, and describes its cost-cutting zeal. He details its use of new technology to revolutionize internal systems. These insights from the inside are very interesting, but - perhaps because the author was in the highest ranks of the company's leadership - the tone is so pro-Wal-Mart that it has the taste of public relations. However, if you seek immersion in this distinctive corporate culture and want to emulate the principles that worked for it, we stand beside the big glass doors and welcome you to Wal-Mart. Do you need a shopping cart"
books,0 of 1,5.0,Is this really Crichton?,"Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton is a very entertaining read. This book has the page-turning ability of all of Crichton's other books. However, this book does not have the scientific background that some of his other books do."
books,3 of 4,5.0,"An eye opener, a well written and educational book from a jounalistic point of view.","I bought this book to get a better understanding of the Al-Qaeda movement, the Muslim religion and the politics of the Middle East.  Despite being a learned person in some areas, and somewhat knowledgeable in others, I must admit that I knew very little about the Middle East, its countries and history.  This book was a starting place for me.  It explained the birth of Al-Qaeda in brutal Arab prisons, the life of Osama Bin Laden, his growth into a rebel and then an extremist and finally to the lack of communication between the FBI and CIA which helped to lead up to the travesty of September 11, 2001.  I must admit that I would have to read it again to absorb all of the details, and I might.  Lawrence Wright has written an excellent well-researched and readable book, I highly recommend it"
books,7 of 9,1.0,Don't judge a book by its cover,"This book is basically a poor product that has been successfully sold. It is terrible. It is a lie! On the back of my book it says &quot;Jazz up your site with 20 exclusive, ready-to-use professional CGI scripts and subroutines--no programming required!&quot; It is sold as if it will satisfy the needs of people who do not understand Perl, while it is almost impossible for it to satisfy anyone, as it is. Hours and hours of troubleshooting and trying to figure out what is wrong is part of what you will get from this book. If you survive through that part of it, you will probably learn that it would be easier for you to learn Perl enough to do things in your own way. Buy another book. Find another way"
books,5 of 7,5.0,Not Guilty!,"I grew up in Ada. Tommy was one of my older brothers best friends. I know Tommy had many faults but he is not a killer. He was very respectful of me and my sister and had a gentle heart. I think this book tells many truths but several are not researched in enough detail. My oldest brother Melvin Hardin is mentioned in this book but the information is only minute as to what actually occured. However, I do think this book served its purpose as to get the finger off Tommy and Karl and will hopefully serve justice eventually. I hope Tommy and Karl are released to at least live the rest of their lives as they choose"
books,2 of 7,1.0,"Mean, poor writing and an ill effort to fulfill 300 pages...","First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract."

This book really helped me take control of the situation. Now I have the green Mohawk and the nipple rings and my teenagers think I'm the coolest dad around, and they're as obedient as can be.

In the last couple of years (since the year 2000) I've returned to the fold, this time taking advantage of the many top-quality graphic novels out there, and Robert Kirkman's ""Walking Dead"" was one of the titles most frequently recommended to me since I started this reading spree.  It lives up to the hype."

books,,5.0,"Hands down, the best legal thriller I ever read!","How do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you've ever read?  This was a well-paced, highly entertaining story, but the book's real success is its longevity.  You continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it.  Hands down, this is Connelly's best novel.  Few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end.  Mick Haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works.  To him, it's a machine, and he's the ""greasy angel"" who keeps it well oiled.  Even though Haller's cynicism is a constant source of amusement, his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence.  Then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client, who can pay top dollar.  Accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman, Louis Roulet hires his services.  What first seems to be a straight forward case, will ultimately test Haller to his limits: his family will be threatened, he will be accused of a crime, and someone very close to him will die.  Not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system, the writing is first-rate."

His books, over 20 of them, have been called the ""landmarks of the managerial profession"" by the Harvard Business Review.  He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought.  In 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams.'  In 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers' concept."

Even if you're not, this book will encourage, inspire, and jumpstart your writing. Lamott is funny and insightful, but what I love is that she pushes you to be gentle with yourself as a writer (writers tend to be overly critical and pessimistic about their work). If you're ever faced with writer's block, this book is a must have. You'll laugh your way back to the page"
books,1 of 1,5.0,An Atlas of the Imaginary World,"Consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, Calvino's fiction is sui generis, a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory-oriented ""If On A Winter's Night A Traveler."" This is the kind of novel Borges might have written. A celebration of the unbridled imagination, ""Invisible Cities"" is also, I am convinced, a secret love letter to a single city: the imaginary dream-city of Venice, a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea"

Using only this book, one commercial practice test, and about two months of evening study, I took the PMP exam and passed it handily on my first try.  If you've looked at PMBOK 3rd Ed, you know that it's designed as a reference, not a learning tool.  Crowe's book provides the same information in a study format.  In addition, it covers the numerous topics that are on the PMP exam, but are not in PMBOK.  The real test had its hard questions, but none that were a total surprise after reading this book.

books,5 of 8,5.0,48 LAWS OF POWER:  My Son's Evaluation,"My son (34) is currently incarcerated.  He asked for this book so I had it sent to him.  He holds on to it for dear life and swears, had he read this years ago, it would have changed his life for the better and he wouldn't be where he's at.  He raved so much, he insisted I order one for myself.  I did.  In summary, what I derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first.  Otherwise, you'll be no more than a stepping stone for others.  It's a good book but I oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by 500-600 years.  Fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son.  It's a Bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them"

books,0 of 6,2.0,The First Farmers,This is not one of the better books I have read on history that predates mankind.  Before reading the book I knew that women were the first farmers.  The author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women.  I do not buy the argument
books,32 of 32,5.0,The best book on hiring & interviewing,This is an extremely well written and very useful book on hiring techniques and methods. The author analyzes all aspects of the hiring process beginning with the different types of resumes and when each type is used; what flags to look for and how to evaluate an applicant's overall resume. Chapter five focuses on short-listing through a `phoner' while the subsequent chapters are devoted to interviewing techniques and the science of asking questions.

books,,5.0,Fantastic finish to the triology...,"Book of the Dead is a perfect ending to a great triolgy of books, the started with Brimstone and Dance of Death. I highly recommend reading those before starting this one, each book basically continues from where the previous one left off in a cliffhanger fashion. The Book of the Dead continues with Pendergast battling his evil brother Diogenes, and it continues to be compelling. Dance of Death was probably more exciting than this book, but I found this book to just be more interesting. It reveals alot about the characters, and you learn more about a certain girl who is shrouded in mystery. She plays a pivotal role in this book, and it ends in a bang. You honestly can't go wrong with these books, they once again show why they are the masters of mystery"
books,,5.0,Big Laughs,I bought this to read to my five year old son. I had to stop reading at times because he was laughing so much.  It is silly and fun to read.  I would recommend this to anyone who has little ones.  It is very entertaining and lots to see

The book is huge and not really meant to be read in one sitting so don't try. I just keep mine of the coffee table and pick it up opening it to a random page everytime. I always put it away with a new sense of vision and delight. Highly recommended for everyone. EXCELLENT"

That wasn't to be, but this book inspired me to go into science and engineering and now I'm a successful programmer; I've heard the book influenced many other people similarly, including many who worked on the space program. If you have similar interests, I think you'll find Rocket Ship Galileo absorbing, even if dated"

books,1 of 1,4.0,"Well written, but be prepared for grim","Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen."

I am so happy to see that there are other options that are successful. I am not better yet, but working closely with my naturopath and using this book as a resource I am making steps to my recovery. I encourage anyone going through any autoimmune disorder or anyone truly interested in what they are consuming and how it can effect one's health, to read this book."

Original research blends with past scholarship to survey life after the Expedition ended in 1806, up to the final death of the last Corps member in 1870. Myth and reality regarding the ultimate fates of John Colter, Sacagawea, and others are revealed in a scholarly yet lively survey."

Sure, it's directed towards kids, but this 42 year old kid at heart blew through it in a couple of days, and plans to do likewise with the next two in the series.  You'll enjoy it too"

books,,5.0,humorous and meaningful,"This book is more than just a hiking narrative, although it is that.  Listening to Bryson read his account of his Appalation Trail hike, you become immersed in his life.  You can almost see the forests, feel the breezes, enjoy the mountaintop views, and hear the wildlife.  You also become well acquainted with Bryson, his hiking partner Stephen, and many fellow hikers on the trail, and it is often very funny.  He also brings in a lot of the history, geology, and ecology of the regions he travels through.  I believe that the listener will find himself or herself very enriched by this well written work"

books,3 of 3,5.0,Second the motion Broadening our sense of the 'human',"I recommend Dennis Littrell's review of this book on this site.He outlines clearly what the book is about, and gives us the basic story of each of the seven chapters, the seven cases that make up the book. He headlines his review 'extraordinary genius' and I share this feeling about Oliver Sachs."
books,5 of 5,4.0,"Well-done, Readable Book","James Surowiecki's ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" is a readable and understandable book that attempts to bring an esoteric concept and present it to the layman.  Surowiecki's thesis is simple: a group of people that is diverse, independent, and decentralized usually reaches a better solution to a problem than even the best experts."
books,2 of 2,4.0,fabulous little book,"This book tells the two real secrets that create good business writing, rule of thumb and writer's intuition.

books,9 of 10,4.0,Mr. Verne's Best.,"Note to all first time readers. This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick. Mr. Verne's book deserves the appelation, ""far ahead of its time."""
books,,5.0,"Enlightening, Revolutionary, and Worth a Read","In an unrelenting quest to understanding the history of the United States, one obscure name comes to mind, Thomas Paine.  Paine helped establish the meaning of democracy and the ""united"" in United States.  His two monumental works, COMMON SENSE AND RIGHTS OF MAN, provided the philosophical and rhetorical building blocks that the founding fathers, such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, et al., would emulate with the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.  Many take for granted the origins of freedom and democracy in the United States, and as with many school history textbooks depict, Paine merely appears in a paragraph or two, and quickly disappears to historical oblivion."

books,5 of 8,5.0,fabulous legal thriller,"The poetic macabre message shakes up Father John O'Malley, the Jesuit Pastor at St. Francis on the Wind River Plantation.  The caller stated that revenge has been taken with deaths.  Not long afterward, at the sight of an 1874 massacre in which the Shoshone betrayed the Arapaho to the cavalry, three Shoshone are found murdered with their bodies ritually left to look just like the historical slaughter here."
books,1 of 4,4.0,One of two good books on this subject,"A good book that explores the Star Wars saga from a Christian perspective without compromising either faithfulness to Christian faith or to the Star Wars cosmology. I was troubled a bit by the many errors in this book---incorrect statements about biblical characters, Star Wars movies, as well as Lord of the Rings."
books,3 of 5,5.0,Objective look at recent history,"Avi Shlaim has done an outstanding job of presenting the brief history of Zionism and the formation of the State of Israel.  Although he tends to editorialize his own perception of history, Dr. Shlaim, nevertheless, remains true to the facts"
books,10 of 13,5.0,Grammaire des civilisations,"This book is extraordinary! Meant for French lycens in their last year before sitting for their bac exam, it was a failure. However, looking at today's situation of the west vis--vis the Islamic and other non-western worlds, it is a jewel. Among other things, it explains the origin of today's conflicting attitudes. For example, why the Egyptians and other Mediterranean peoples become in overwhelming majority Moslems several centuries after the conquest by the Arabs"
books,5 of 9,2.0,"""Classic"" doesn't improve with age","Like many other readers and Amazon reviewers, this book was assigned reading for me in high school. I read it again recently when the kids got it...and found it has not improved with age. One wonders why generation after generation of teachers continues to tout this book as a ""classic"" when it's really far from enjoyable."
books,5 of 23,4.0,A fast read....,"I have to say I really enjoyed this book.... no it's not Hemingway but it is fast moving and held my interest from the first page.  For a first time novelist, I give it two thumbs up.  I have certainly read worse by more established authors."

Roulet is what experienced attorneys call a ""franchise"" client - he's willing to be billed full schedule A top dollar legal fare, he's got the money to pay and he wants to go the distance in his own defense. But Roulet's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens Haller because, despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not, Haller becomes convinced of his client's innocence. He recalls his deceased father's advice to other lawyers, ""The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client."" Haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man."

books,4 of 19,1.0,there's a few hours i'll never get back,"Really, I hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review, but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves. You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Instead you'd be left saying, ""Jon Stewart, my man, you liked this? Seriously? Are you high? No, wait don't answer that, it's all becoming abundantly clear to me now."""
books,4 of 5,5.0,Emotionally devestating,"I won't delve into the plot of this novel, as I'm sure other reviewers have covered it; and I won't comment upon the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry or the African plight, though they are certainly comment-worthy and beautifully shown.  Instead, I'll tell you why I found this novel unique:  it emotionally devastated me."

books,,4.0,The children laughed out loud!,"I read this to 7 and  8 year olds in a second grade class. I had to explain some of the words, but the children enjoyed hearing and seeing the book. The illustrations are helpful,. I dont think it would stand up to re-reading to the same class, but it was a funny diversion between more serious and longer books"

I gave copies of the 1987 edition to my sons when they graduated from college and I am giving them the 2005 edition as they approach 40.  Tobias has been consistent with his advice over the years.  He does not promise to make you rich but he gives guidelines for ending up with a comfortable retirement; partly by getting one to acknowledge what one does not know.
books,17 of 19,5.0,Breadth and Insight,"Andrew Isenberg presents an array of complex and systemic causes that brought about the near extinction of the North American bison.  The author's breadth of knowledge related to the bison demise is incredible.   The reader is not bored with endless details behind these knowledge blocks,  however.  Rather, in fairly short order, the reader understands how  climatology, geography, economics, sociology, migration and immigration,  policy, and anthropology all played a role in the bison's destruction.  And  while the author presents an incredibily well researched description of the  bison's destruction, along the way, the reader learns volumes about how  Native Americans lived, changed their lifestyles, and were linked to the  bison.  The reference listings are impressive for those needing further  information and authentication.  Anyone interested in how the American  plains were settled and shaped, this is an enjoyable read.  For the  researcher, this book is a gold mine"
books,3 of 3,4.0,"Interesting, just a bit dated at this point","As a special ed teacher of an autistic classroom, I found this book very interesting. It was written at a time when ABA treatment for autism was a little known and cutting edge treatment, whereas now you can barely Google the word 'autism' without countless ABA references. As a result, Ms. Maurice describes a journey through a world of therapy options that have fallen by the wayside in today's treatment world...play therapy, holding therapy, and the like. This book is famous because it helped, in part, to make ABA the widely used therapy it is today."

books,,2.0,Not Bad,"I use ""The Notebook"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with ""True Believer,"" I was more satisfied with ""The Rescue.""  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,"
books,,1.0,That's It,"Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers"
books,4 of 5,5.0,"Excellent, accurate true crime book","LaRosa has done an excellent job of presenting the facts of this tragic case in concise, easy-to-read detail.  I grew up in Tacoma and one of my closest childhood friends was one of the first Gig Harbor police officers on the scene.  LaRosa's account of the events leading up to Crystal Brame's murder and David Brame's suicide meshed completely with what was going on behind the scenes that only the police knew about at the time.  Tackling the issue of spousal abuse is never easy; it's even more difficult when one of the parties involved is in a high-profile position of power. What could have easily been a cumbersome, he-said/she-said book became a solid true crime story through LaRosa's obviously well-researched words.  The area, the people and the aftermath were vividly portrayed.  I highly recommend this book"
books,10 of 15,5.0,Promote Mutual Understanding Through Text,"This book is highly recommended to understand the fact that imperalism goes beyond the political and economic domination. Imperialism stayed in the most subtle way, in the culture. Said clearly described that the reaction toward imperialism is mutual: from the Western side, the prejudice and biased and the supremacy-feeling, which unfortunately still existed today; and from the ""other side"", also prejudice and to the extreme side, anti-Western."

books,1 of 1,5.0,The answer to (almost) all of your questions about Neverland,"This really cool ""prequel"" answers once and for all the burning questions you have been harboring about the man-child who lives in Neverland with other little boys.  No, no - not THAT one, I'm talking about Peter Pan, the fairy-loving, pirate-hating leader of the Lost Boys. (Same thing, you say - but that's a different story altogether)"
books,,5.0,DAM - good book,"Very compreshensive.  From how to name and label photos as you import them to what type of disks to use for backups.  He covers thousands of details that i would not have thought about.  Is clearly geared toward professional level of photo indexing.  However, he offers helpful suggestions for any level of digital photographer."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Good read on Gettysburg,"I bought the book while in Gettysburg and read it nonstop on the flight home. It's a quick read and will definitely keep your interest. I highly recommend the movie Gettysburg as well, and having read the book will provide deeper insight than what a movie can do. Above all, visit Gettysburg, as touring the sites and seeing the terrain will make The Killer Angels come alive. It did for me"
books,,1.0,Unanswered Prayers,"Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before."
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Story Worth Reading,"This book gives a glimpse into the toll that war takes on those who survive.  No one but those who endure it can truly fathom the horrors of PTSD, but for the rest of us who want to understand, this book is the best I've read yet.  Paco wanders through his life finding some solace in washing dishes in a small diner in Texas, losing himself in his work and barely surviving mentally from day to day.  The style of writing drew me into Paco's suffering.  Although it is fiction, it is written by a Vietnam vet and left me wondering how many Pacos there are among us.  His story is one that may well haunt you long after the final page is read"

books,10 of 21,2.0,Impractical. Over complicated!,"Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, I really cant appreciate the value, usefulness or practicality of this book. The proposed framework, that each difficult conversation is really three (The ""What Happened?"", The ""Feelings"" and The ""Identity"") Conversations, is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem. You may think I am a contrarian or a poor communicator. However, with my very positive experience (and reviews) on books like ""How to win friends and influence people?"" by Dale Calegie, ""Get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again"" by David J. Lieberman , ""How to talk to anyone?"" by Leil Lowndes and so on, I am obliged to warn potential buyers, in particular regular readers of relevant books, of a big disappointment."

books,1 of 6,5.0,A Practical Guide for Eliminating Stalls from Complacency,"Complacency is one of the biggest enemies of any organization, but especially for successful ones like Intel. ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE provides two powerful observations that will help anyone who reads this book: (1) That changes are lurking out there that need immediate attention inside your organization and (2) That you must be constantly vigilant for large discontinuous changes (such as those driven by microprocessors, Intel's main product). Having the perspective of someone who has been both the beneficiary and the target of discontinuous change, Dr. Grove's lessons become all the more real. At first, I thought this book was a little overdone; but upon reflection, I feel that complacency is probably best overcome by paranoia in the absence of the management process to locate, anticipate, create and adapt to externally-driven discontinuous changes. I often cite this book in our writings about how to be more successful, because I believe it is an important work. Please read this book, and take its lessons seriously. But have fun while you are being paranoid"
books,1 of 3,5.0,An Essential Read,I can't add anything that isn't already on the backcover. Putnam has detailed research showing the loss of social capital in the U.S. and insightful analysis of the implications as well as possible solutions. It's a highly readable book for academics and non-academics alike. A vital read that will be relevant for years to come
books,1 of 2,5.0,For people who enjoyed being children,"A book that enables you to travel back in time...back to 1958, back to a time when there was Stan, Mike, Richie, Bev, Eddie, Ben and Big Bill and some others...back when some kids' main concern was avoiding Henry Bowers!"
books,5 of 6,4.0,An All American Story,"Third Down and a War to Go is a page turner which chronicles the 1942 University of Wisconsin all-star football team and its college years, heroic service in World War II, and return to unsung ordinary lives. It was a different era for college football. Players actually wanted an education. The majority were less than six feet tall and weighed less than 200 pounds. What scholarships they received were so meager that even the All-Americans washed dishes and waited table. There was no question about them interrupting college and collegiate football to serve their country. Some selflessly gave their lives but most returned, played some more football, and contributed to America's post-war recovery as lawyers, teachers, real estate agents, and Jerry Frei, the author's father, as a college and pro football coach. Most never discussed their war service and certainly didn't consider themselves the ""greatest generation."""
books,0 of 1,4.0,The story behind the movie,Many people became aware of Frank Abagnale Jr's story until the movie starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo Dicapprio was released (even though an earlier movie based on this story was released).
books,3 of 3,5.0,Very Informative and Vital Interview Information,"John Kador has done a great job with this book.  As a very experienced Executive Recruiter, I am constantly shocked at how badly people interview.  This book will give you some excellent advice on what questions to ask and more importantly what questions not to ask.  Every Recruiter and Hiring Manager would like their candidates to ask good questions in the interview process.  This book will help stimulate you to ask the correct inquisitive questions.  If you have lost your job or are going to be looking for a new job soon, then I would recommend purchasing this book"
books,,5.0,a BIG idea for social change,"Every now and then, a book comes along that opens our minds to an idea that can change the world, and in so doing changes us and reminds us why we read and search for that next great book with that next big idea.  I have a very short list of contemporary books like this, and ""Mystery of Capital"" is one of them"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great book!,"I loved this book!  I had absolutely no idea what kind of dog I wanted to get before reading this book.  This book separates the breeds into very logical chapters and also cross-references other chapters that the dogs would fit in.  I love dogs so much that I was only able to reduce the number that I'd love to 19, but it made me consider breeds that I never would have before.  Once I reviewed my 19 with my family, we were able to bring it down to 6 and I'm now doing research on those 6 in order to determine which one we'll buy.  This is a great read if you're toggling between a few breeds and want to make sure you consider the good and the bad in the breeds"
books,26 of 26,5.0,An Early Postmodern View of the History of the West,"This postmodern chronicle of the western world by early 20th century German historian and philosopher, Oswald Spengler, offers a lot for today's reader despite its flaws. It's an incredibly rich and complex analysis, attacking the causal factors of the development of western culture on many fronts simultaneously: historically, scientifically, artistically, architecturally, ecclesiastically, and so much more. This book is capable of describing many different aspects of western culture to many different readers, depending on who they happen to be and what their interest in western history is. I will only mention three aspects of Spengler's work in my review, since these aspects are what grabbed my attention, bearing in mind that the book contains much more than what I touch on here."
books,13 of 14,5.0,Great teacher help,I use this book in my classroom.  It helps my students come up with better ways of saying and writing things.  It is quicker for them to look through than a thesaurus.  It helps ESL students widen their vocabulary easily.  It also helps me when I work on papers while getting my Master's degree.  It is a great aid

books,,4.0,"Great book, but a letdown from ""Pretty Horses""","This is an undeniably beautifully written book and wonderful story, but was a little less of a personal favorite than was the first book of this Border Trilogy. McCarthy dropped a bit of the power and simplicity of language of ""All The Pretty Horses"" and instead became much more wordy and allegorical. I appreciated the straight-ahead story of the first book that also managed to project a lasting emotion at the same time. In The Crossing, the language was as beautiful, but there were often stories and sub-plots that stalled out the otherwise fast and engaging book. These asides seemed to have been added to build depth in the characters, but for me weakened the story"

Life can throw all sorts of roadblocks before us, but if we trust in God and try to maintain a positive attitude, we will triumph over them. I feel that Robin wants all of us to experience the joys that are just waiting for us in life."
books,20 of 21,5.0,By my great-aunt's rump!,"I can tell this is an unusual fantasy just by checking out the main character. Most fantasy heroes are not round, stodgy, middle-aged men who are respected pillars of the community. But the enchanting fantasy ""Lud-in-the-Mist,"" reminiscent of ""The Hobbit"" in some areas, stars just such a man, amid dozens of other nice ordinary boring people who get their lives magically turned upside down.."

books,,5.0,"Great thriller - the ending could be more satisfying, though","If you're acquainted with Greg Iles' work, you know that he's a different author. His books are very different one from another. He changes subjects, pace, types of characters. He's able to write a legal thriller with the same easiness he writes a very fast kidnapping story. With ""Dead sleep"", Iles continues to prove - at least to me - that he's one of the most talented thriller authors of the last ten years, along with Michael Connelly."
books,,5.0,Anonymous in New York,"My kids absolutely love this book.  Every time they see a dog they don't know, they ask what it is and look it up in the book.  There hasn't been a dog they haven't been able to find yet.  The color photographs, not illustrations, are great.  I highly recommend this book, especially to kids who love dogs"

books,,5.0,How to Boil Water,"I ordered this cookbook for my daughter who is away at college.  I reviewed it before I sent it to her.  It has all the basics, how to shop for food, how to store it, how to prepare it, even basic cooking utensils that a beginner would need. She loves it and uses it all the time.  So I think this the true measurement of the book being user friendly."
books,10 of 13,4.0,A Foodie's Delight in Profiling the Recent Evolution of the Celebrity Chef,"As the co-writer of the bellwether of gourmet culinary tomes, ""The French Laundry Cookbook"", author Michael Ruhlman has written an eminently readable book that should satisfy any foodie. His focus is rife with possibilities as he explores the development of the celebrity chef. What Ruhlman gleans with carefully gathered insider knowledge is the advent of the chef as an entrepreneur rather than an artisan, a trend that has been discernible for the past decade. This has a lot to do with the success of the Food Network and related lifestyle programming, but also playing significant roles are writers such as Ruhlman and Anthony Bourdain and the simple fact that perceived exotic ingredients are now available at local supermarkets."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Masterfully done,"I was a little scared when this book first arrived.  It was huge (almost 1,000 pages of text) and I didn't really know much about Truman so I was affraid I wouldn't be interested.  I am happy to say this ended up being an awesome book.  McCullough is my new favorite author.  After reading this book I feel like Harry Truman is an old friend that I've known my whole life.  That is why I love McCullough's work.  Once i finished this book someone asked me if Truman was my favorite president.  I didn't know what to say.  I can't say that I agreed with everything he stood for politically and he messed a few things up while in office but you have to love him for the man that he was and McCullough does a great job of capturing Harry's personality.  Don't just buy this book but all of McCullough's books.  I have since read 'Mornings on Horseback' and 'John Adam' is on order."
books,0 of 1,4.0,The End of Iraq,I think that Ritter has it about right about what is going on in Iraq at the present time.  If I have a critisism about the contents of this book it would be thast the author seems to be biased in favor of the Kurds.

books,2 of 4,5.0,Just write,"The big gift that the present public school system bestows upon most of us is a giant inferiority complex.  Few of us ever wake up to the mental prison-cells that society has put us in and fewer still escape.  Anne Lamott's book is one of those that not only encourages people but shows them how to let go of their perfectionism and internal critic and all the other fears and ego traps that keep us from creating.  Once you get past this junk, you begin to see you don't really need books telling you how to write at all.  You just need to write."
books,0 of 1,4.0,McCain for Prez.,"John McCain's book is verywell written.  I found the advanced vocabulary outstanding.  The way the book is put together is very hitorically orientated.  He starts with his Grandpa and the impacts he made on John's life, then about his own father and the sacrafices that helped shape his faith.  How he did in the navy and being shot down.  Finally he tells you about His struggles in 'nam and how his hardships there helped make him a better man.  A really good biography and tribute, John McCain for President.  GOD bless POW*MIA not forgotte"
books,4 of 5,5.0,"McCarthy, a brave writer with an incredible constitution","I was initiated into the world of Cormac McCarthy with this novel in Southern Lit class.  My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to"
books,5 of 6,5.0,What a life!  What a book!,"I became a part of Kazan's world upon reading the first sentence of this remarkable book.  Kazan raises candor to the level of literature, something most writers simply cannot do.  But it's so worth aspiring to as a means of written communication."
books,,5.0,Certainly changed my mind about Al Shepard!,"I am a ""space nut"".  I have read numerous books, seen numerous vhs and dvd stories of everything from the start of the space age to the shuttle flights.  I have never had a more inspiring feeling than upon finishing ""Light this candle"".  It started a little slow with all the early life details of Shepard but, helped later in the book with how & why he reacted to many (and I mean many) tough situations that he faced in his unbelievable life.  Being a space nut, I was happy to see little details explained in the book that are lacking in other books I have read.  Such things as Shepard talking about laying in the LEM following an EVA on Apollo 14.  He and Mitchell were supposed to be sleeping but Shepard talked about the ""eerie silence"" and hearing the A/C unit click on and off.  Also, feeling like they were going to tilt over and falling out of the bunk when he thought the LEM was sliding down the edge of the crater.  All of these things made it a ""tough to put down"" book that I would HIGHLY recommend."
books,0 of 1,5.0,Intense and disturbing,"This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs"

books,,5.0,How to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD.,"This book is first published in 1999.  Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc.  The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages.  The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.  It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century.  Concepts like ""individuals will outlive their organization"", ""how to defines one's goal and contribution"" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD"
books,3 of 5,5.0,The art of teaching old dogs new tricks,"How is it that the Oakland A's have won the AL West in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll?  That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball.  One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas.  It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news.  The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up.  Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others.  And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning.  When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point."
books,1 of 1,5.0,It works!,"I have a very independent 14 year old daughter who does not respond well to being told what to do. Using love and logic strategies works really well with her. If I ask her what her plan is for homework tonight, she gives me a reasonable plan and does it, which is much better than yelling at her all night long to get it done. This works in a lot of different situations. For example if I ask her what the consequence should be (before hand) if she doesn't get her room cleaned when she says she will, there is a lot less arguing about doing her room or about the consequences if she does not get her room clean"
books,4 of 5,5.0,Finally--an investigative reporter takes on the important issues,"This book is a terrific volume for understanding what's gone wrong in America over the past 30 years.  Unlike many best-selling authors, who spout only uninformed opinions and vitriolic ones at that, this guy actually does substantive research on his issues and helps us understand the deeper context behind them: the history, the players, their connections to other folks.  What good is that you'll learn how much of our world is being controlled/destroyed by people and regulations that you've never even hear of or about.  If everyone read this book and spoke up, we might actually preserve this democracy and live better lives.  We'd understand what in our democracy and world is going wrong and have some ideas as to how to fix this."

books,6 of 7,5.0,Understanding,"When it comes to American history, it is arguably so that the most important dates or events, whivhever you prefer, is the American Revolution.  The dates run from about 1764, with the passage of the Sugar Act to 1783 the Peace of Paris was decided, or even as late as 1787 when Delaware became the first state in the Union.  However you look at it, there is no one text that gives you a better, more thorough telling and understanding of the most important time in out history, before we officially had a country to even have a history, than The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution by Bernard Bailyn.  This is the most thorough and most balanced fusion of primary documents and secondary analysis.  Every topic is important every conclusion is crucial to understanding the truth about this great and terrible period in our history.  It receives my highest recommendation"

books,1 of 2,5.0,Reading Lolita in Tehran...for ENGL 474 (Jenn Kight),"In all honesty, upon first reading the course list for ENGL 474 Issues in Rhetoric, I did not immediately understand why this book was in the course list. But, now that we're halfway through the book, I understand quite well. This book answers some questions that I've had in my own mind regarding why certain books are banned. The book discusses Gatsby, by FS Fitzgerald, as it is a work studied by the author's class in the Tehran U. I read Gatsby twice in highschool and never considered it a controversial work. However, in American society, we are well acquainted with the idea of cheating on spouses, for example, (as it is always all over the news/tabloids at the grocery store - ""who's cheating on who"", etc.) which is one of the issues that the Islamic students in Nafisi's class found disturbing. But in Iran, however, during the Revolution, everything was controversial - but the concept of adultery to Nafisi's characters is completely heinous. So, culture plays a huge role in why works are banned or are considered controversial."

But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me"

I know that I've read a great book when it haunts me days after I've read it. This book did just that. The characters were raw and real and flawed. The details and setting were rich. The story was difficult to read at times, but the reality is that life is filled with both beautiful and horrible moments. I look forward to reading the next book by Khaled Hosseini."

books,36 of 37,5.0,A classic in print once more!,"This is one of the great Latin reference grammars.  Where most people fail is in expecting a grammar to be a textbook; case in point, another reviewer compared this to Moreland and Fleischer's _Intensive Latin Course_, which is a fine textbook, but not a reference grammar.  This and similar grammars by Hale &amp; Buck or Gildersleeve are essential for the advancing student, but should never be approached like a lesson book or be read straight through.  They're called &quot;reference&quot; grammars because you're meant to &quot;refer&quot; to them on specific questions of grammar.  Get it?  For the beginning student or for a simpler (albeit less authoritative) treatment, I recommend Bennett's grammar.  But Allen &amp; Greenough is an excellent, excellent grammar.  When you've gotten a bit further along you may consider adding Woodcock's _New Latin Syntax_"

However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted"
books,1 of 1,4.0,A good read...,"I am surprised at the low star rating on this book as it was truly a good read.  However, having said that, I'm still in a quandary about who did it!  Who killed Vance Calder?  I used to think Arrington wasn't too bad, but in this book I really lost respect for her.  She's a weak whiner and doesn't have much understanding for others or a backbone to stand up for herself.  Stone, of course, continues to be a whore and sleep with every beautiful dame that comes along.  I really hope he's finished with Arrington, but I have my doubts.  Is Arrington's son Vance Calder's or Stone Barrington's child?  We still don't know, but we have our suspicions because Calder had enough money to get the original DNA tests skewed.  I simply love Dino and Stone sure should have listened to his partner about getting involved with Dolce.  What a frightening mess that woman is!  Truly, it's a fun ride in the life of Stone Barrington...especially if you want to listen to the book on tape"

books,1 of 9,1.0,Very Whiny,"Tina is molested by her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father, until her mother finally tells her that he isn't. Tina is vague about the details of the abuse and doesn't actually say what happened, so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went. She prays to God many times to make it stop (why'd he let it start in the first place?), but God is not listening at those times. Finally after many years of this abuse, her mother catches them together, and instead of kicking him out, sends her daughter to a school out of town, with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day. The Lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together, and they don't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he's sorry (sorry that he got caught). Says it's just something about Tina that makes him do it.  Make sense? The mother works at Kmart and likes to have kids she doesn't care about, and the dad works ""in an office""."

It follows the lives of a group of characters who express New York City's ethnic, socio-economic, and political rivalries through their involvement in a highly-publicized case of hit-and-run. A car belonging to Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue, one of Wall Street's most successful bond brokers, accidentally strikes a young black man in the Bronx. With the injured man in a coma, Harlem preacher, politician, and general rabble-rouser Rev. Reginald Bacon sees an opportunity to advance his agenda -by delivering the racially charged case to ambitious District Attorney Abe Weiss and to unscrupulous tabloid journalist Peter Fallow. Prosecutor Lawrence Kramer jumps at the opportunity to bring down a wealthy WASP in the name of equality. And streetwise Irish lawyer Tommy Killian may be McCoy's only ally in a city where truth and justice take a back seat to just about everything."

Even though the event includes political leaders, academics, journalists, and an occasional movie star, they are mere window dressing accompanying the real movers and shakers.

Praise God that a voice has been raised to expose these fables and deceptions.  If you are a sincere Bible student I would encourage you to get this book. Could it have been put together better? Probably, but let not that take away from the truths that are revealed here.  Christians it is high time that we get back to the Burean method of Bible study (Acts 17) and not be taken by certain authors just because the local Christian Bookstore promotes them.

The agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author. The poems are rather sophomoric at best, and are poorly written. Most of them make no sense; you would have to be inside Ms. Walker's head to comprehend her contorted style. It appears that Ms. Walker should re-enroll in a college level poetry class.

books,4 of 6,5.0,A book of books.,"Nafisi's memoir, ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"", takes its readers deep into the life of a woman living under the ever increasing repression of the Iranian regime.  She is an academic whose love of books drives her to use them as lenses through which to view the horrifying events that surround her. Each of the book's four sections takes the works of a different author and uses them to illuminate aspects of the oppressive Islamic regime under which she lives. The book presents a startlingly vivid picture of day to day life in Iran as suffered by a woman who, though very intelligent, is unsure of whether her allegiances lie with her government or with the west. Though Nafisi explains the political events surrounding the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war, she does so not from the view of the history that's been written, but from the view of a citizen living in the times, providing an essential shift in perspective."
books,,2.0,a minority opinion,"Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he ""wound his arm around her waist""). Less than halfway through this story, its central ""mystery"" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places."

Because I did not want to give half my  salary to fast food restaurants and eat from stryofoam for the rest of my  life, I decided I ought learned how to cook.  That is when I started  collecting cookbooks. I started with Cooking For Dummies and went on from  there.  I quickly found that I had a knack for cooking and soon came to  enjoy it.  As my cookbook collection grew, I quickly discovered that there  were two types of cookbooks:  Those you cook from and those you read.  This  is the first cookbook that I have found is good for both.  The recipes  included are fabulous and it is a great book to browse.  The recipes come  on all levels so the cooking klutzes and the Julia Childs alike will be  able to use it.  When you buy this book, and you certainly SHOULD buy this  book, go directly to the recipe for blondies.  I had never heard of them  before but they are cheap and easily made.  After I made the first batch, I  made a double batch to take to work where I had just started.  Let's just  say it made breaking the ice in a large office a lot easier.  Thanks, Ms.  Anderson"

books,7 of 9,5.0,Amazing Book,"I was given this book by a friend. I am here on Amazon to buy 8 copies to give to acquaintances I know will enjoy it as much as I did. It's amazingly thought-provoking. And apparently controversial, I had to write a review after I read the one that gave the book a low rating, though the reviewer admittedly hadn't read it. There's a reference to folks like that around page 750 referring to wayward 'intellectuals' at Smith and Stanford."

The content itself is a bit too brief, but would still be very helpful if it had been done some time in the last 1-5 years"

books,2 of 2,4.0,Thomas L. Friedman was born a ramblin' man,"Thomas Friedman's ""Longitudes and Attitudes"" is a very readable book based on a collection of columns he wrote for the New York Times just before the attacks of 9/11 and for the year following those attacks. The last quarter of the book contains a kind of diary in which he attempts to put into context where he was in the world when he wrote these columns and how he was personally feeling at the time."
books,15 of 15,5.0,The First and Still the Best Multidisciplinary World History,"When Fernand Braudel originally published this text in the sixties, he became a pariah at the Sorbonne.  In retrospect that disapprobation was the kind of seal of approval that ""banned in Boston"" came to embody.  Previous histories drilled deep into one facet of history.  Braudel's was a pioneering effort in multidisciplinary historical analysis.  It captures the historical flow that evolves civilizations, sacrificing only the detail outside the themes.  Even subsequent to ""A History of Civilizations,"" other historians have been unable to write a thematic survey that matches this original.  And don't be tempted to skip the ""soft"" introductory chapters with titles like ""The Study of Civilization Involves All the Social Sciences,"" and ""The Continuity of Civilizations.""  These tee up the hard topics, like ""The Greatness and Decline of Islam.""  There's method in Braudel's approach, and it takes patience.  Braudel's translator, Richard Mayne had his job cut out for him.  The complex syntax is that of a French intellectual of the sixties, and it is retained in Mayne's text, but you become accustomed to it.  Don't look for maps or photographs in this Penguin Paperback; the text alone is six hundred pages.  There's only one other book in this space, ""From Dawn to Decadence,"" by Jacques Barzun.  In my view they are complementary"

They loved it and we read it many, many times together.  It is the perfect age level for my 7 yr. old grandson, but a little long for the 4 year old.  We usually just ""talk the book"" because he loves the illustrations. I am an artist myself and I just love the artwork.  After the first reading of the book, it transferred over to the dinner table.  What would happen if we had a flood of green beans?  A funny, silly and wonderful book"

One of my favorite novels of all time, The Talisman is the modern version of Tom Sawyer and the newer version of The Lord Of The Rings.  Bold statements, I know, but I can't say enough about this book.  King & Straub just clicked on this project and the results are brilliant."
books,108 of 120,5.0,Powerful and passionate prose that will inspire you!,"These often intense and firey speeches made by the Anti-Federalists or the detractors of the Constitution (as it was being written and then debated) are powerful, passionate and sharp enough to make one feel these words were  meant to be weapons, i.e., the front line defense of the freedom and  liberty we so easily take for granted today. I feel that much of what is  wrong in our political system today was predicted here, and what would  constitute the only real solution, i.e., active, democratic citizenship, is  also demonstrated here in their willingness to fight against tyranny with  reason and passion.  How much greater our public debates would be today if  this were required reading for all citizens!  &quot;Politics&quot; would be  thought well of again and refer to what citizens do in noble service to  communities, close to home and far away.  Do yourself a favor, get inspired  again as to the original principles and purpose of democracy, read this  book, and believe again!  And do something"

Hiaasen's humor was incredible-I found myself laughing often. Even though the movie didn't cover as much ground as the book, I think the movie was much better than most people have let on.

books,13 of 15,5.0,An Absolute Must Have For Pregnancy!,"I absolutely LOVE this book.  I grabbed a pile of books at the bookstore and looked through each one carefully before selecting this one.  It is the only best-selling guide written by a doctor with millions of copies sold.  And I know why now that I own it!!  I don't see the negative like some readers do.  It is written by a doctor, so it provides a lot of info that you'd get by talking with your doctor every day!  So there are things that you should know about even if you don't want to hear it or don't think it will happen to you!  It explains things such as bleeding during pregnancy, some common medications to avoid to prevent birth defects, pollutants to avoid and why, STDS during pregnancy, nutrition and sources/serving sizes, how your actions affect your baby's development (vaccinations, smoking, xray, falling, safety, etc.), possible tests, required tests, lying on your back, rh-sensitivity, douching, sex, backaches, exercise guidelines, air travel, car safety, breastfeeding, pregnancy discomforts (hemmorhoids, constipation, backaches, foot swelling, dizziness, breast itching, cramping, contractions), infections, hot tubs, jaundice...  It really is like having a doctor's advice for each week of your pregnancy.  It relieved alot of the worrying about symptoms I was experiencing, realizing that I was ""normal""."

King sounded a bit defensive on the promotional tape his publisher sent reviewers. Wambaugh was a cop, and he writes about cops, King says. You have to write about what you know, he goes on, just like he writes about Maine."

Technology has alway been encompassing - now looking at Human Tech, Nature Tech et all - it become galringly obvious there is so much mis understanding of the nature of technology - its hard to discern where the future is headed.  Five regions really brought back focus to major areas of innovation for me and my collegues - thank you Joel - it look sliek you are coining new venacualr and creating a new technology lexile again"
books,11 of 16,2.0,An OK Memoir At Best,"I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that."

He had read it also and found it very helpful to understand the process he was going through and he highly recommended it and THAT SAYS SOMETHING!   When my Mom was passing I read it and although I was scared to read it, it actually was nothing to fear....it was comforting and enlightening and made the process much easier for me as the caretaker and daughter.  I recognized and understood the things she was saying much better and knew how to respond in some unusual circumstances.  I recommend this book to ANYONE dealing with the process of dying.  I bought extra copies to give to others who are losing someone close to them"
books,1 of 2,2.0,Predictable,"I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one."
books,1 of 1,5.0,really helpful,this book was really helpful in understanding how much marketing work is involved with doing art. it's a little intimidating to think that you will need to write press-releases for everything you do. but thats' the truth i guess if you want to play the game. that is if you want to play by and set your own rules instead of just being a tool for the whims of gallerists and dealers
books,3 of 3,5.0,Two decades of Ross' comic book art come to life,"DC comics fans who love comic art collections must have MYTHOLOGY: THE DC COMICS ART OF ALEX ROSS: it's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters Ross' art brought to life over the decades, from Superman and Flash to Green Lantern. Included also is Ross' new comic book series Justice, new sketches, and an oversized coffee-table format which helps display and profile, in full color, Ross' entire line of DC Comics superheroes. An original Superman and Batman story written by graphic designer Chip Kidd, a re-telling of Robin's origin written by Paul Dini, plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover MYTHOLOGY appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own."
books,3 of 3,4.0,Exciting audio w sound effects,"I listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away, it is a find!  Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers.  I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book.  I also liked that the story was partly done in first person.  The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world....."
books,,5.0,Great read!,"Nora Roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance, mystery, action scenes, etc. and they are all present in this great read. I also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality. There's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims. The tension is high, and though I had some ideas, I did not figure out who the killer was until the very end."

books,3 of 3,2.0,First disappointment by Nicholas Sparks,"I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John)"
books,,5.0,Wonderful!,What a charming story! This book is a perfect quick read for an adult over a cup of hot cocoa........or a great adventure for a young girl.

You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars!"
books,1 of 2,5.0,I don't care what you have heard or read: READ THIS BOOK,"Maybe M. Night's movie ""Lady in the Water"" didn't make nearly as much as it should have, but he is and will continue to be a REAL artist.  Michael Bamberger's (a REAL artist and true reporter himself) book ""The Man Who Heard Voices"" is a testament of M. Night's dedication to his craft.  He tells of the man who has enlightened and revitalized our imagainations with all of his movies.  Sadly people now a days all seem to be film and book critics and are so involved in intellecutalizing creativity right into its grave.  We need to remember why we go to movies, why we tell stories, why we asked our parent's to tell us that bedtime story one more time.   Bamberger's book (and Night's movie) do this very thing.  In fact, they are this very thing."

books,2 of 2,5.0,"Witty, Poignant and Gripping","Jennifer Gilmore's first novel is a stunning debut.  From start to finish, Golden Country draws the reader into the inter-twining lives of the Bloom, Brodsky and Verdonik families, first and second generation Jewish immigrants raised in the ""golden country"" of America.  Gilmore has developed brilliant, complex characters - ranging from tragically comedic Sarah, an alcoholic full of regret of how her life turned out, to Francis, the larger-than-life go-getter who doesn't let her ""frumpiness"""" get in the way of success."
books,2 of 2,5.0,As relevant today as it was in 1998,"Some books may not be particularly recent publications but deserve renewed attention and ongoing recommendation in light of modern events or contemporary concerns: James Walsh's You Can't Cheat An Honest Man: How Ponzi Schemes And Pyramid Frauds Work...And Why They're More Common Than Ever is one of them, focusing on how pyramid frauds work, why they're common, and how to avoid scams and cons. The scheme name may change but the scheme is the same: it involves case studies in greed and exploitation, outlined in You Can't Cheat An Honest Man so that investors may learn from the woes of the 'taken'.

Both are excellent books. I love romantic books. They suit my personality beautifully. I even have considered trying to write a love story, with my own experiences. Real life is a lot better and more complex then fiction ever could be. But I do like fiction as much as I love biography or autobiography. Any genre is fine by me."

books,,4.0,Scary Science,"This is a haunting book about the effects of science and human attempts to alter nature. As with most horror stories, the narrator survives which everything around him crumbles, but the meat of this novel is riveting. There is great action, the main characters are interesting (though not fully developed) and the story moves quickly without a lot of pause. The message of this book becomes more pertinent every day and while the science underlying Dr. Moreau's experiment is iffy at best, that does not detract at all from the effect of the novel. I would  recommend this book to all science, science fiction, or horror fans."
books,50 of 51,5.0,What a blessing!!!,"I cannot express what a blessing this book is in our lives.  My husband's arthritis began at only 22 years of age and it was progressing fast.  No one in my family has this disease and I did not know where to turn except a specialist.  We saw a specialist for a few years, and I always asked was there nothing more we could do to cure the arthritis?  I could not believe that he would have to be on medication for the rest of his life.  Since he was in his early twenties, this would mean years and years of constant, daily medication.  Of course this would eventually mean problems with other parts of his body due to medication intake.  I still did not know where to go to find a cure rather than just an immune supressant.  Then, he came home one day after an appointment with his doctor involving a new set of x-rays.  He was now being told that his bones were starting to be eaten away and bones in his left hand had most likely fused together.  He was still only 27 at this point!  I could not imagine what permanent consequences would come over the next years and I could see him not being able to play with our little boy or do anything with his hands in the future.  This pushed me to stop at nothing to find the cure.  I knew it had to be out there, but where?  After tons of research and reading, I found the cure!!!  I cannot begin to express my thanks to the author and her research and her sharing with the world.  I just can't understand why the medical community does not know, or if they know, why they don't share the knowledge.  My husband is in college and this very night was studying Rheumatoid Arthritis in his anatomy class.  They have NO information on how diet and food sensitivities can cause RA and they state they know of no cure or really good medications.  It just blows me away that millions of people suffer when the cure is out there, available, and really not difficult.  If you or someone you know has RA, please get a hold of this book!  I was unsure about the cost, but boy am I glad I tried it out anyhow!  We found that corn is his sensitivity, which makes cooking a little more tricky at first, but once we figured out what he can and cannot eat, we are doing great!  It took a little effort in the beginning to find the ingredients that will work, and we had to adjust recipes, but he eats totally normal.  In fact, we all eat more healthy now.  And I don't mean bran and tasteless food.  We eat everything we ate before, but now it is fresh and from scratch.  He has been off ALL medication for almost 6 months now and we are on our way to complete recovery.  His right hand is totally normal now, and we are soon going to try the recommended trigger point method to fix his &quot;fusion&quot;.  The info here WORKS!!!!!!  It takes dedication and a short lifestyle adjustment, but what a blessing everything in this book has been.  An answer to many prayers!  THANK YOU!!"
books,7 of 13,2.0,A polemic parading as history and analysis,I was very excited about this book before I started to read it.

Unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met.
books,8 of 10,5.0,A Classic Argument for Education,The usefulness of this book for us in 2005 lies in the way it gives a wider historical perspective on current debates over racially-tinged political issues - particularly affirmative action in college admissions and funding for inner-city schools.
books,5 of 5,4.0,"Excellent faery tale: strong, charming and unsentimental","This is a lovely mix of fantasy and faery. Gaiman's characters and plot lines stack up with the brothers Grimm, but he adds some flesh and personality. But not too much personality - we don't get bogged down in introspective angst or belabouring the human condition. He's kept it simple, but managed charm over banality. We're carried along by the events, sure, but none of the characters are throwaways: my favourite was the unnamed `little hairy person' - the scene where Tristan meets him is a cracker. The magic feels magical, the innocents are good, the witches are bad, and the conventions work for Gaiman, not against him. Moreover the mix of plots and subplots is pretty much seamless - it's unusual to not notice a few bumpy links here and there, but I just realised I didn't notice a thing (well, maybe the topaz...)."
books,4 of 5,2.0,Dreadfully Boring,"How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding"

I have shown canine's, and won CD tiles at AKC events by using these methods, and have documented proof! Mrs. Fisher, which is one of the authors, holds a degree in animal psychology and gives you an in depth look into the mind of the canine...The book has great details in the why's of different methods of, reading your dog, and trying to understand why he thinks the way he does! On my very first obedience trial for an Obedience title, the dog got his first Qualification for CD Title when he turned 6 months of age.

books,,5.0,Lewis's best,"To my mind, this is the best of Michael Lewis's work.  His style and observations show the humor and zing that have become his hallmark, and his writing is at top form.  Next examines the changes wrought by the Internet from the perspective of several entrepreneurs who have exploited its potential, mainly in the form of vignettes.  There is no beginning, middle or end, so if you're looking for a story with a plot line, this is likely not going to appeal to you.  The lack of story line is, however, what I found compelling - the theme of the book is, ""There's this 1800-pound bull out there that everyone is studying and avoiding, and here are a few folks who have ventured out and ridden the bull and had great rides.""  This is pretty much quintessential Michael Lewis - he finds an individual, or an event, or an industry that has fomented a paradigm shift (a deliberate choice of words here, since Moneyball dealt with the emergence of SABRmetrics, whose acolytes all seem to have read ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"")."
books,3 of 7,1.0,Secret Code?  Ha ha ha!,"Mr. ""Dow 36,000"" wants you to believe him this time.  No, really, he means it.  Right.  In 2005 he he wrote an article denying that there was a housing mania about to go bust.  I think that's a pretty good indication that there is a housing mania about to go bust.  This guy is amazing"
books,0 of 1,4.0,"Excellent book, bad language","I really am enjoying the audio recording of this book, but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word, to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous. I understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece, but I think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it."
books,27 of 32,5.0,A conservative looks at the 20th Century,"Paul Johnson is opinionated and a good writer and this history is very readable.  ""National Review"" named it one of the top 100 books of the century and, although I'm not a political conservative, I found myself in agreement with much of what Johnson says."
books,1 of 1,5.0,great book on how we view risk and odds,"We are used to calculating odds to make decisions on a daily basis, whether it relates to betting at poker or horses, deciding what the traffic is going to be like on different roads en route to work, etc.  This is a great analysis of how we have arrived at our current state, with a particular interest on how to calculate risk.  This book is very succinct, and does not dwell unnecessarily on particular topics but moves forward in a most agreeable manner.  This written in a historical manner, and I believe will appeal most to those that want to have a better understanding of how to analyse risk and/or the historical underpinning of our current state of knowledge"
books,3 of 4,5.0,Inside My Heart: Choosing to Live with Passion and Purpose,"I loved this book and couldn't put it down, I read it in two days.

I just ordered another copy for my youngest daughter as I didn't want to give my copy up.  Thank you Robin for sharing with us"

books,9 of 9,4.0,Don't dismiss this book because a Hollywood celebrity wrote it.,"As it says in the forward, yes, the medical community should catch up with Suzanne Somers. Hormones are a complex subject, and the author Suzanne is wise in the way this book is written and how the content is presented. She asks the questions (what we all want to know but were afraid to ask), and gives you her opinion. But the book is in a question and answer format where the professionals are giving their answers. You may not want to do it Suzanne's way, but she's asked the right questions, and used her celebrity to bring attention to a very important topic - one that professionals and patients should be more aware of, and that major pharmaceutical companies wish you weren't"

books,8 of 11,5.0,Great background on right-wing extremism,"This book is an excellent primer on how the religious right wing extremists have hijacked the Republican party and dirtied the face of conservatism. Please note: I did not call them ""Christians,"" because I think these extremists have also blackened our name as well. Brock's personal story illuminates the ""back story."
books,,5.0,Great for doglovers and dog haters,This book is great for dog lovers.  I thought that the part about training your dog and such is dull because the pictures and accrual description of the dogs of the book is the best.  It is great for someone who wants to get a dog and find which one is perfect for you.  People whom already have a dog would not be board in this book. I had already had a dog before I got this and it was fun trying to find my dog and my friend's dog in this book.  I think that this book is great for all ages because just looking at the pictures if fun.  Anyone who says this is an awful book must be wrong only thing is there are more dogs in the back that do not have a description which means you my not find you dog in this book
books,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent in every way!,"Expertly written, the stories are fascinating, endearing, & enlightening.  You'll learn so much about how your own mind is wired by reading the stories of these very special people.  The medical and literary communities need more people like Oliver Sacks"
books,8 of 39,4.0,"Great analysis, Dated polemic, Big irony","Ironically, Dennett (and Dawkins and Darwin) provide sophisticated believers with the best tools ever for understanding how a God might have purposefully injected the human memosphere with permanent belief in himself and endowed his believers with the sense of purpose, intentionality, goal-seeking, and teleology that keeps religion alive and growing. A God can accomplish all that *simply* by imbuing the Universe with Darwinian selection, since all Darwinian systems exhibit an epiphenomenal teleology so realistic that we might as well just define real intentionality as ""the behavior of individuals (memes or genes) struggling for survival in darwinian system."""
books,1 of 2,4.0,"A good read, though not up to Winchester's usual standard.","With the 100th anniversary of the Great San Francisco Earthquake I eagerly anticipated Winchester's latest book. I highly enjoyed ""The Map that Changed the World"" and ""Krakatoa"" and I expected a similarly great book this time."
books,2 of 2,4.0,A book that gives a good feel of the period.,"Written in the context of the Cold War, the author emphasizes the need for free markets and an open society for a society to property function.  It stresses the importance of the individual and the needs of the individual against the backdrop of an ""ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country"" era and the basic economic honesty of selfishness in general.  There are several ideas in the book that probably need to be revisited (which is why you should read it) since they are becoming issues again in today's world."

books,2 of 2,5.0,Classical Music  Third Ear,"An outstanding achievement.  I've always appreciated the Penguin and Gramophone guides, but this book beats them, hands down.  I enjoy the no-nonsense, irreverant tone.  The various writers call it the way they see it, and I don't pick up the industry-commercial bias that I sometimes do with Penguin and Gramophone.  I'm impressed that this book still lists the LaserLight Mozart CDs by Vegh and the Salzburg Camerata Academica that are such fantastic bargains.  The writers also pull no punches when it comes to Naxos, whereas Penguin and Gramophone tend to gush from time to time: Wordsworth's Mozart is criticized while Wit's Tchaikovsky is praised--quite a revelation.  Added bonus: the listing of quality Christmas and Noel music in the back section chapters.  I will keep turning to this book in the months ahead ... I hope they do Rock and Jazz in a similar fashion, soon."
books,10 of 15,1.0,Read Ladislas Farago to really learn about Patton,"This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie ""Patton"" based on Ladislas' book.  It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men."

books,2 of 7,5.0,A must read for any Barfly fan.,"This novel by Charles Bukowski is basically the making of the movie Barfly.  All of the people are recognizable even if given not so obvious fictional names.  If you are a lover of Bukowski and a lover of Barfly the movie, this is a five star classic.  If you are a lover of either of the above----it's still a four star, well written work.  I found that this novel exceeds both Pulp and Women, his other known longer works, in both writing style and movement of plot and characters.  Theme wise it takes you to the familiar places that Bukowski often drags you to"
books,,5.0,"Okay, I'm in love with Walter","I've re-read this book several times now. Lani Diane Rich is a master of romantic comedy and the offbeat heroine. For those of us who are tired of reading ultra-perfect female heroines, Wanda's a breath of fresh air, slightly tinged with the scent of Scotch. It's hard for me to believe that other reviewers here never let go with a four-letter word when things aren't going well, and the author's willingness to go there with her character gives Wanda the feel of ""the real""."
books,8 of 9,5.0,"Great RPG, lots of fun",I am a veteren D&D player and friend recently introduced me to SWRPG.Overall SWRPG is a very good game but is slightly similer to 3rd edition D&D with blasters instead of swords and the force instead of magic.However there are many deeper changes that really make it feel like Star Wars and both RPG veterans and new players will have a lot of fun with it.
books,2 of 2,4.0,"An excellent book, but very depressing","Amazing Grace by Jonathan Kozol is an enlightening book.  It is very interesting and well written.  It portrays the lives of poor people and innocent children living in the inner cities of New York City.  The book focused on mature and complex topics such as homicide, the AIDS virus, drug use, and religion.  Kozol makes a strong argument that life in the inner cities is unsafe for children.  He argues that children's schools and homes are inadequate and unacceptable.  He also discusses the faults of the government, such as how it's decisions help the rich and hinder the poor.  Kozol addresses issues about hospital services for the poor regarding money deficiencies and discrimination.  Kozol interviews several people who explain how they feel mistreated and unwanted by the upper-class white society.  They feel like burdens, and believe that the white people would be happy if the poor left the city.  It is amazing to see that in spite of their suffering many poor inner city people are very religious and have very strong faith in God and Heaven.  Amazing Grace open's one's eyes to the less fortunate, and reminds us to be thankful for all that we have and to enjoy life even when things do not look great.  Overall Amazing Grace was a very good book, inspiring and interesting, a good read"
books,3 of 4,5.0,Very inspiring book EVEN inspires me to want to write,I was reccommended to read Planet of The Blind due to my interest in writing stories about people who had disabilities and about by own disablility for I'm visually impaired myself and I have an interest in writing. So I read Steven Kuusisto's book Planet of the Blind and found it very facinating and inspiring! I highly reccomend it! I'd love to know what is he doing now and is he still writing and speaking of the book
books,4 of 5,5.0,"Terri, mother of Mary Catherine","I was given this book  by the Richmond Down Syndrome Society when our daughter was born with Down Syndrome.  It was quite a shock as we did not know she would be born with DS.  I knew right away when she was placed in my arms (I'm a special education teacher)and within 20 hours of birth she was whisked away to the Medical College of Virginia.  This book was so very helpful to both myself, my husband and my family.  We all learned so much from it and we passed it along to my brother (her guardian in the event something were to happen with us) and his wife.  They also found it helpful as they knew what to expect.  Overall,  I cannot stress enough that these children are so wonderful in their own way and this book helps to give you an inside view of what to expect with your new baby."

His answer is that Western countries have developed flexible legal systems that recognize emerging property interests, especially in land."

While it seems to be a secure location, cleaning out the walking dead inside proves a monumental task, and the discovery of surviving prisoners makes the group grow by four more.  However the group is far from safe, as a threat from within begins killing them one by one.  It is one of the surviving inmates, or one of the group?  More twists and turns in what has become one of the best comics around today.  Highest recommendation"

books,5 of 12,5.0,Use of Internet for Non-business and non-workplace Scenarios,"The comment on editor (using the reviewer's sacred space) is not out of place. Amazon has a different logic to treat people. In the previous incarnation amazon.com had an option for author's to comment. Now, I presume, it is turned into Guide."
books,14 of 14,5.0,An Invaluable Resource,"My husband and I are lawyers who have recently returned to reading Shakesepare, decades after college. We wanted literary criticism that was qualitative superior to the plot summary readers guide--criticism that would help us explore the imagery, themes and metaphors of the plays. Marjorie Garber is the answer to our prayers. We recommend to readers returning to Shakespeare that they purchase a paperback edition of each play with good notes to help with line specific language issues--the Arden series is the best-and then supplement/enrich the experience with Garbers insights. It is a pleasure for us to carefully read each play and then see what treasures she has mined based on her own reading and that of prior critics. We considerably prefer Garber to Bloom as a single compendium. Garber  packs an enormous amount of insight into a single 30 page chapter. Shakespeare is surely worth the detail she provides. I would also suggest that you purchase the Ambrose DVD set of tapes of the great BBC plays--after you have read the plays it is wonderful to watch Jacobi et al. The DVD format enables captions which is very helful to savoring every line."

books,,5.0,A Helpful Way to Think about Spiritual Formation,Mulholland's text is a very readable and approachable primer about using scripture for spiritual formation.  One of the things I especially appreciated was his definition of spiritual formation that formed the foundation for his text.  He refutes those who want to use scripture or any 'technique' to become more spiritual for their own sakes.  Mulholland points the reader to a focus outside of themselves.  He maintains that spiritual transformation must be for the sake of others and not ourselves

books,2 of 2,5.0,Thank you Robin!,"This is a fabulous book filled with common sense (which is not so common, after all!).  Robin shares her perspective on being a wife, mother, daughter, daughter in law and most of all a woman.  It's not a ""self help"" book, but more of a ""this is how I did it, you can do it too"" book.  I really liked that she spoke about how women need to put themselves first (self care) on all levels to fill whatever roles we need.  And the personal devastation she went through in her own life because people around her didn't do this."
books,2 of 4,4.0,Quite A Romp,"BARFLY is what first brought Buk into my life, so this thinly veiled fictional account of its making was a joy to read. It's a bit goofy in spots (some of the names Buk came up with to represent the real stars he encountered are ridiculous), but classic Buk nonetheless. Why isn't Buk taught in college English classes yet"
books,4 of 6,4.0,Change at a Core Level,"This book is for readers who are ready to look inside themselves in order to change their organizations. It isn't a book for novices. You need a fair amount of business experience to have the perspective to understand author Robert E. Quinn's message. Likewise, you need to have enough invested in your current organization to care if it changes. Quinn offers some theoretical analysis, but leavens it with ample practical examples and exercises. If you have a job, rather than a career, or if you are committed to staying in a narrow, technical field or just waiting for your retirement, skip this book. However, if you're willing to engage in extended self-examination, we suggest this to you. However, be warned that that many of Quinn's drills are emotionally challenging, such as identifying how you resist change or pegging which elements of your organization are more committed to the status quo than to success. But, then, whoever said change was easy"

books,,4.0,Deserves its reputation,"After having lived in NYC for 12 years, I finally read this book.   It had been recommended as a must-read for anyone who had ever lived in the city.  Many reviewers commented on the ""leisurely"" pace of the story, and I agree.  The description of the event in the climax of the story, though, I found too long and almost unbearably tedious, especially since such care with detail was missing from a lot of the other events in the book.  The time travel part was especially troubling to me; I wasn't at all convinced of its process.  However, I still enjoyed the book and was very satisfied with the ending.  As many have said, stick with it."

books,4 of 4,5.0,Simply wonderful,"There is no one else like Edward Jones writing today.  Imagine someone writing with the elegiac tone and richness of language of Doctorow mixed with deep emotion and you get Mr. Jones.  In these stories, the lives of ordinary citizens of Washington DC come to life in a way that gives testimony to the creative spirit.  In a literary world crowded with the talented and clever but short of heart, Mr. Jones is the real deal, someone who writes with intelligence for readers who love to read serious fiction and care about the human condition.  With his three books of fiction, Mr. Jones has reached the rarified air of the greats of American literature.  If you are passionate about serious writing, you'll read these stories again and again.  They are that good"
books,39 of 39,5.0,Extraordinary; a work of genius,"These are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist.  Oliver Sacks, author of the justly celebrated, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986) and Awakenings (1973), which was later made into a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity.  He has a style that is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical comparisons and wisdom.  Part of the power of these tales, and of all of Sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality.  This makes for a compelling read.  If you've never read Sacks before, you are in for a very special treat."
books,,5.0,The greatest debut ever,"Maybe some people will not like it, but this book is as good as they come!. It's plot is superbly and tightly woven; the characters seem like people you could find in the supermarket, yet they turn into extraordinary people when facing extraordinary challenges. Clancy makes this transition in a very smooth way. The events are concatenated in a highly logical way to get you to the final ending. About the only thing I can criticize is the somehow biased stance it takes in USA-USSR relations, but we have to remember that the book was written when the cold war was still something from the present."
books,5 of 5,5.0,'Dynamics of Innovation' continues to,"The existing reviews really get to the heart of the matter. I can only add that this book continues to provide a powerful framework for analyzing technical innovation - the process and maturation of that innovation within  a market. As I survey the rapid growth of trading hubs/net market makers in  the industrial procurement space, I am struck by the similarity to the  examples in the book.  The hyper growth in this space sets the stage for  the inevitable shakeout and establishment of the dominant model - yet to be  determined. It is exciting to watch the market mature, with the knowledge  that the changes are part of a cycle which can be comprehended and has  repeated itself in multiple industries. Utterback provides a powerful  framework with which technological innovation can be understood. Thank you"

books,6 of 7,5.0,great book and perfect chance to reevaluate your life!,"OK--I loved the book and agreed with the basic premise that Americans sure need to take a good look at their lifestyles---the whole materialistic overconsumption thing is really disgusting once you recognize it-I have read several books with this similar theme(Kalle Laasen, Naomi Klein,Travels of a t-shirt in a global society, etc) and the more I read the more ""stuff"" I eliminate from my life- I do not think that all the kids are as bad as some of those out there think- and not everyone is so pathetic and greedy as the book points out--it is just better imagery to paint a portrait of an America that has lost itself in a self-centered materialistic mire- I have 4 kids who do not get everything they want--they do chores--they learn to behave and show respect and they work hard. I know so many parents just like me and there are many very close neighbors in my neighborhood and others in my town. There are block parties, people help eachother out (not only after disasters either) and life goes on--no--we do not live in some imaginary Eutopia--we live 0n the East Coast- we work jobs and save money for our childrens college etc-- I say all this because although I agree with the book that American culture as a whole is going down the tubes,I think there are many people who are living in America that are resisting this cultural downfall--I do wish that this book could be required reading in schools !!! Sometimes it is difficult to get my teenagers to understand my rantings!! It is worth the effort and if each of my kids and all those other great kids out there can recongnize the   games advertisers play and can resist the temptations toward overconsumption that is pushed on them-then they will lead us into a fine future. Lets encourage the ""counter-materialistic-culture"" and pass the reading along!!"
books,11 of 12,5.0,Melissa Albert's review is filled with inaccuracies,"Like Catherine Maurice, I have two children that were diagnosed with autism at age two; one in 1994 and the other in 1996. I am a registered nurse and a long-time autism advocate. My kids are at opposite ends of the spectrum at this point but both were very severe at diagnosis. I cannot help but wonder what field Ms. Albert is in; perhaps a restaurant reviewer?  She appears to have so little basic knowledge of autism, its symptoms and effective evidence-based treatments. Do you have or know any children with autism Ms. Albert?  The Maurice kids displayed very classic signs of autism and the doctors that diagnosed them and later published a study detailing their descent into autism and recovery are some of the most respected autism experts in the country. To question their credibility and the reality of her children's diagnosis just makes Ms. Albert look foolish. And to actually endorse Martha Welch's holding therapy, which borders on child abuse, along with other useless or unproven treatments just adds to the absurdity of her claims."

books,3 of 4,4.0,Wonderful and Enlightening Book,"Amazing Grace is an amazing book by Jonathan Kozol that portrays the impoverished life of thousands in the ghettoes of New York City.  It is a nonfiction book where Kozol goes into extremely poor areas of Brooklyn to interview several people who must live that filthy life everyday.  Kozol uses theses interviews to prove his point that the government is at fault for the horrifying conditions that many people in America live in.  He uses many people's situations as examples to prove that the government does not do enough to help these people live.  Kozol dives into topics such as AIDS, asthma, homicide, education, drugs, and many more.  Kozol effectively appeals to the readers pathos, ethos, and logos because it allows him to connect with the reader, and allows the reader to adopt Kozol's concept that the government is to blame for the ridiculous living conditions in New York ghettoes."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Paradigm shifting,"What an outstanding book! I would not be exageratting by saying that this book has influenced me, particularly my leadership style, more than any other. The ideas therein pop into my head several times a week, as the wisdom of crowds rears its head over the course of my day. Examples include viewer ratings on youtube, student ratings of teachers at the school where I work, online doctor ratings by patients, movie recommendations by the masses on Netflix, and more. The collective people's opinions are generally dead on - even when individual opinions vary. This is the premise of the book, and one that I am now firmly convinced of."

He starts out examining old societies that failed and why they failed, then slowly moves to modern times. However, reading the environmental issues of the day one comes to quickly realize we are not much different from those collapsed societies of the past. There is hope, in that by realizing and learning from man's past mistakes we may be able to protect our world for future generations to enjoy. 5 stars"

books,0 of 2,4.0,3rd Degree; James Patterson,Exciting and well written.  Easy to read.  Keeps your attention
books,1 of 1,5.0,One of the Four Horsemen,I read this book when it first came out and lost it when a friend didn't return it. This a fascinating book and since it was first published SARS and Bird Flu has entered our world.  If you are prone to panic attacks or nightmares don't read this book because the author did a fantastic job at research and has revealed our future and the diseases that will alter it
books,5 of 5,4.0,Entertaining and Informative,"When I started reading River's End, it reminded me of a remake of the ""O.J. Simpson"" murder.  It is a story centered on a little 4-year old girl who witnesses the death of her mother by her father.  Years pass by and the story unravels Olivia's feelings and emotions as they develop based on this horrible tragedy.  Written in the ingenious Nora Roberts style I have grown to truly enjoy, this story is both entertaining and informative as we learn quite a bit about the Olympic Rain Forest through Olivia's eyes.  I guessed the villain about 1/2 way through the book but the story still held my interest as I could never be 100% sure I was correct.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone."
books,8 of 8,5.0,"A paean to baseball as a unifying, cultural force.","In 1949, when Doris Kearns was six and living in Rockville Center, NY, her father taught her how to chart and score a baseball game, the primary (radio) entertainment of her community.  In these years, it was baseball that unified the local community, though whether one was loyal to the Brooklyn Dodgers, as Kearns was, the NY Yankees, or the NY Giants was a different matter.  For Kearns Goodwin, the youngest in the family, it was baseball which served as her ritual connection to her father, since she sat with him after dinner each night and related the scoring of that day's game."
books,6 of 10,4.0,a balanced review,"First, the problematic word in the title: ""the Left"".  Among the reviews below, you will see considerable disagreement as to who the Left is and what the Left stands for.  Much of the confusion is that the word ""liberal"" and the word ""Left"" are conflated by many/most people on the left and on the right.  The sad fact is that people in general (left or right) do not know what liberalism is and hence do not know the difference between liberalism and leftism.  Some suppose it is a matter of degree.  A review is not the place to teach fundamental principles of political philosophy.  You'll have to get an authoritative book on the subject to find out (by ""authoritative"" I do not refer to pop political polemics, whatever their merits).  To whet your curiosity, I'll only say that liberalism and leftism, although they agree on social justice, hold totally opposite positions on two other fundamental principles."
books,6 of 7,4.0,Are you reading this for class...?,"If this book was assigned to you as a high school student, you may have a tough time liking it. Your high school teacher either doesn't like it but teaches it anyway, or else loves it so much that he/she can't understand why you don't."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent,This is an excellent book covering the bomber war over Europe in the final two years of World War II.  It is authored by two more recent RAF veterans and the book is simply outstanding.
books,2 of 4,4.0,Many good revews for so Full a Productive Human Life,"I never appreciated this man while he was President or victim of a scandal from his own weakness! Yet after reading FrKurt Messick's excellent review, I gained valued insights into the inner life & struggles of Bill Clinton. After a few Chapters into his years as Governor of Arkansas, he solidly attributes his salvation to his Wife and Family. I doubt that he can justly objectify his personal status when he endeavors to separate his constant external and internal struggles!"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Koen's best,"This prequel to Through a Glass Darkly does not disappoint.  If you like Charles II and the period of The Restoration, you'll love this book.  The character of Alice Verney is intelligent, charming, controlling, manipulative and sympathetic.  She is fiercely loyal to those she loves and unforgiving to many.  Through her story the reader learns a great deal about the personal and political history of King Charles - the tragedy, the whimsy and the fascinating people that orbit his sphere.  Great book.  Highly recommended."

books,1 of 1,5.0,New observations on technology and the future,"This is a fascinating, original take on what lies ahead. Rather than project a single future, authors Joel A. Barker and Scott W. Erickson examine existing trends and group them into five regions of technology. They explain each technology, extrapolate the future it might create if it alone shaped the world, and then discuss how these different technological currents might intersect. Barker and Erickson paint their five futures in broad swaths. This allows them to cover a lot of ground and sketch many potential markets and challenges, but it also means that they cover their ground shallowly. Of the five technologies they examine, they are far more solidly grounded in ""Super Tech,"" ""Limits Tech"" and ""Nature Tech"" than in ""Local Tech"" or ""Human Tech."" They sometimes treat individual and place them in categories their fans might dispute. For example, science fiction author Isaac Asimov was a long-time supporter of population control and of limiting the power of machines, but he is found here in Super Tech rather than Limits Tech. These small nuances should not take away from your enjoyment of this book, which we recommend to managers who want to plan for a flexible, productive future, and to those who enjoy mental experiments and challenges, since, at times, it is simply fun to read"
books,,4.0,Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book and have purchase the next book in series.  If you are a fan of Dean Koontz you will not be disappointed.  I give it four stars only because it is one of those books where you have to get past a chapter or two before you are hooked in, but well worth the wait.  Whew, what a ride"
books,,1.0,Never Judge a Book by its Cover,"When I stared reading Danielle Steele's novels, well over 20 years ago,they were amazing. The characters were larger than life, the dialog spot on, and the plots original and well thought out. I'm sorry to say that I was drawn to this novel because of its slick cover and interesting premise. After reading ""Coming Out,"" I had the feeling the author was as bored writing it as I was reading it. In no way could this book have been written by the same author who wrote ""The Ring."""
books,,4.0,Harry Potter accepts his mission.,"In this next-to-last volume of the epic series, Professor Dumbledore shares hidden secrets with Harry about his foremost adversary - Voldemort. Harry makes an unusual discovery in Potions class that serves him well, but even so, another great friend is lost. Also, a surprising someone now stands with the Dark Lord. If you are a Harry Potter fan, you've got to read this book to find out WHY he-who-cannot-be-named is such a menacing evil force.  You will never guess the ending of this volume and where it will take you next."
books,7 of 11,5.0,This is...BIG!,"Oh. My. God. I passed up buying the complete short stories of Raymond Chandler for this one. McBain, Mosley, King, Westlake, Deaver, and Block sharing the same book? And, mind you, not with any skinny little throwaway, wrote-in-a-weekend, virgin Bloody Mary shorts, but with big phhhhhat novellas. The novella is one of the greatest lost forms of detective fiction -- a dense, polished gem waiting for future generations to find in a dusty magazine pile or anchoring an obese anthology."
books,5 of 6,4.0,A retrospective on how far we've come...,"I've read some of the other reviews of this book and overall agree with some of the issues raised (hours of very strict ABA to make an autistic child 'normal' at all costs, dismissing special interests as 'perseverations', etc.) but I want to point out that this book was first written years ago. First published in 1993, and at that point the author is looking back in time by several years, so the actual events probably took place in the mid to late eighties. At that point in time there weren't the online support groups, the various autism organizations, the plethora of well-known therapies from Floortime to Affective Based Language to RDI, or in general much awareness of what autism was at all. Parents were left to their own devices to do the best they could and, even if I disagree on some points, who out there could start from square one like that and still manage to come up with every answer, something we still haven't managed today?"
books,2 of 4,5.0,Great follow-up to book 1,"The story continues, with Eragon being trained by the elfs, his brother Rowan becoming involved, leading up to a great battle with a surprising twist. Delightful read. You learn a lot more about the humans, elfs, dwarfs, dragons, and urgals. Can't wait to see how it all ends"
books,3 of 3,5.0,"review from a real-world manager, not a consultant","As a medical practice administrator, I found the approach described in Dressler's book as practical and an approach I intend to use for a tough decision I am struggling with, and wondering not just ""what's the answer"", but ""how do we decide between a number of less than ideal choices with big impacts - - and are we exploring the full universe of options?"".  I am excited about implementing Dressler's approach; I believe its clarity and inclusiveness will not only produce a high quality decision, but will generate benefits well beyond the decision itself."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Wonderful and Honest Book,"I love this story, and every character has specific impact on the life of one strong woman. This was definatly a page turner and I never wanted to put it down. I can't wait for another novel from Marie Bostwick"
books,3 of 4,5.0,Great book!,Yunus tells a great story about his bank and its battle against poverty.  Outstanding business model for someone interested in micro lending
books,0 of 1,4.0,A fun and informative read,"I enjoyed this book immensely.  If you loved Perfume by Patrick Suskind, you may enjoy this as well although"
books,1 of 1,5.0,The Greatest Book Ever.,"This is by far the greatest book of all time. Not just on selling, but on almost everything that life can throw your way.  I trust Tom Hopkins and everything he says is very real to me because he tells it, and tells it perfectly.  He is certainly a true Champion.  I will reccomend this book to anyone who ever wants to achieve anything in life, and wants the money, security, and recognition that goes with it. This is the least expencive most valuable tool you could possibly get. Tom Hopkins is brilliant and every sentance of this book reflects that perfectly. If your fed up with being less than you know you can be, GET THIS BOOK!"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Stunning Novel of Combat and Sacrifice at Gettysburg,"This novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction and for good reason. It's superbly written with a keen eye for military and character details. The commanders come alive in this book like in no other except perhaps Shelby Foote's brilliant (non-fiction) trilogy. The movie ""Gettysburg"" was based on this novel. If you love historical fiction and the Civil War you must read this fantastic book. The author's son has made quite a career (Jeff Shaara) out of writing a series of novels based upon this one - before and after Gettysburg (which is the setting for Killer Angels). Unfortunately, in this instance, the apple fell quite far from the tree as far as writing capabilities are concerned. Steer clear of the Jeff Shaara books and read the non-fiction histories instead. But, if you need a good/great civil war novel, you're likely to find no better one than this"

books,0 of 1,5.0,What a Beautiful Edition,"It arrived in great condition, and was a timely turnaround as well"
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Chilling and strange, better than either of the movies","A classic example of horror that does not rely on pornographic gore and shock value for its chill-factor. Of the two movies that have been adapted from this book, the 1963 black-and-white version is a greater achievement of film-making, while the 1999 version is more visually stunning. Neither movie, however, can quite contain how weird and wonderful this book is. Shirley Jackson, queen of the not-quite-sane heroine, unfolds a quietly disturbing piece that makes the reader question how much of the weirdness is external and how much of it is inside the narrator's head. Excellent companion piece for We Have Always Lived In the Castle, which puts a different spin on the same unreliable narrator technique."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Fascinating Read!!,"It seems that today people are becoming more aware of the danger that hurricanes pose, especially after the Gulf's devestation from Katrina, Wilma, and Rita; the four hurricanes to strike the Florida coast in 2004, and now Cyclone Larry which devestated Northern Queensland, Australia. Hurricanes are becoming a much talked about and even debatable topic of how to prepare, track, and live with these storms that are now on the rise."
books,4 of 4,4.0,"be not mislead, it is about the breeds, not the care","As much as I like the book, it was not what I though it would be. This is a book about the various breeds explaining thme briefly to the child reader and introducing them by photos. Some of the best photos at a very reasonable price for those looking into the different breeds around"
books,7 of 7,5.0,Lots of pictures,"This is a really good dictionary for kids.  Gave it to the neighbor's 8-year old, and she loved it.  It has lots of pictures and a pretty extensive vocabulary, so it'll get used for years"
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Very Great Work,"Braudel was one of the greatest economic historians of all time.  His scope alone was incredible.  But what in the end hurt him and significantly diminished his findings was his unfamiliarity with the work of Harold Innis, whose landmark ""Empire and Communications"" was published a quarter century before Braudel published this book in the original French."

books,,5.0,Too sad to be true,"After working for a software company for more than 7 years , this book is actually of no surprise to me at all. However, those of you who want to know how software projects work in reality, this book is a very good and true reflection of that. We probably all studied Project Management Essentials, but all the projects I have been involved in so far, run more like the one described in this book and not like in the school manual. Enjoy the reality"
books,,5.0,Jenny rocks!,"I bought this book for a friend; not for me, a proud child-free woman. Yet, I found myself unable to put it down. Jenny had me laughing so much, my stomach hurt! While it may be coined as just a ""humor-book,"" I think new moms may be able to learn a thing or two about their new role and what to expect during the first year of Mommyhood"
books,0 of 1,5.0,LOVED it!,"I didn't read this book for the ""truth, or the lie"", but just TO READ IT! It was an amazing story, whether or not it's true was irrevelant in my eyes. James Frey is an amazing author. Putting all the ""drama"" aside about everything that went on, I really and truly enjoyed this book"

books,3 of 3,5.0,"if i liked it when i was sixteen, you can too!","Read it, no matter what, no matter if you have to read a page a day for two years, get into it and you won't be able to put it down and then you'll think, that reviewer was right I love this book. It was the best book that I read in my junior year, it wasn't required reading, BUT IT SHOULD BE! And Miss Havisham and Estella! After reading about the endless virtues of Lucy Manette in a Tale of Two Cities, I found those two very refreshing and intriguing and completely unexpected. Read the book, love the book, accept the book and all of its truths, and then name your cat Pip"
books,15 of 24,1.0,Very Disappointing,With all the publicity this book got I thought I would learn something I didn't know.  Very little new in this publication and not worth reading or owning.  Very disappointed
books,,5.0,Excellent tool for self-discovery,"There are thousands of self-help books in the management section of your local bookstore, covering a bewildering spectrum of ideas about how to bring out the best in people. Few of them are helpful, beyond trite statements about human behavior, and even fewer of them are based on more than a modicum of research. Now, Discover Your Strengths is an excellent book on both counts. The Gallup organization has studied excellence in many fields for over thirty years. This book summarizes some of that research from the perspective of identifying and bolstering people's talents."
books,2 of 2,5.0,If you need some motivation...read this book!,"I picked this book up on a whim and am thankful I did.  The quote that grabbed my attention was on the back cover, ""If you can't face one more slab of meat or chicken...[This book]can help.""  This book just may have been written with me in mind!  What I like best about this book is that it is informal, light, and is an easy read.  I appreciate that people on any low carb diet could benefit from this book.  I see how this book would help people who are just beginning to diet, or who have fallen off track, however, this was not my case.  I was really just looking for some added motivation.  I did read the chapter about just starting or getting back on track but especially loved the later chapters about continuing success and hidden carbs.  This book left me feeling more knowledgable and charged to continue on my way to a lighter me"
books,,5.0,Excellent!,"This is by far one of my favorite series of all times. It far surpasses HP in my eyes (I know, blasphemy, right?

A beautifully romantic story"

books,1 of 2,2.0,I must have missed something,"I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character."
books,1 of 1,5.0,how does he know what he knows?,"this was easy enough to read in one sitting (for those of us lacking a lot of &quot;free&quot; time) but interesting and emotional enough to linger. i really truly loved it and was especially impressed by his ability to sooooo nail the feelings of some of his characters. i mean, they ARE his characters, his creation, so of course they are what he wants them to be, but outside of that fact, the characters in &quot;sleepwalk&quot; are very true to their situations. take a look at the story about dylan and donovan, the twin girls... this one most amazed me. as far as i know adrian tomine is not a twin and he is certainly not a high school girl yet the things dylan is feeling felt so genuine to me while i was reading. it was her speaking, not tomine. this is not exclusive to tomine, i know. of course writers create believable characters and of course these characters are often nothing like their creator, but tomine seems to go one further. he is able to create reality in only a few pages. realities that are maybe a little dark, or even outright depressing, but so human and so undoubtedly real"

books,,4.0,Read It in 2 Days,"If you're interested in forensics, chances are you'll like this book.  The book also manages to tie in sexual abuse, repressed memories, Miss., Vietnam, PTSD, and a little romance.  It even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long.  I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book's plot and discussions as intricate as they are"

books,,4.0,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll a young girl with the name of Alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her.  The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister.  She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it.  Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of.  This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of.  Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride.  I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting.  I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way.  This book is for children and adults alike.  As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world."

The main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white middle-class adolescent girl throughout American history.

Are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in Brumberg's book?"

books,1 of 8,2.0,Disappointing!,"I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say."
books,1 of 1,5.0,One Great book,This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. It turned me into a Crichton fanatic. I have since read all of his books. He creates suspense like no one else. Forget the movie.
books,3 of 3,4.0,Disappointing,"One of the things that reveals itself throughout the book is that Dick's writing style gets old. If it wasn't for the ongoing story in ""The Warrior Elite"", I would have been bored with Dick's narrative. In ""The Finishing School"", the pace is slackened due to the fact that the men are all BUD/S grads and have less to worry about. It takes more patience to read and at times it feels like the pace is very slow. Another thing you'll notice is that Dick doesn't reveal much about the details regarding finishing schools. During BUD/S, people can actually see the candidates train in Coronado and the suffering is no secret. However, when they continue on, the training they get is much more classified. This is understandable, but at that same time it feels like Dick is talking much without revealing much. For someone who wants the details, this was frustrating and took out a significant amount of my interest. I haven't read the latest Couch book on SEALs, but I hear it's the same. Here's an advice for Mr. Couch - don't write a book that people will read for its details and not reveal anything. Better off waiting for several years and disclosing the info (like Haney's Delta Force) than beating around the bush. On the other hand, you'll get the big picture about what BUD/S grads do after BUD/S on their way to earn the trident"
books,14 of 15,5.0,Quite an achievement...,"Kear and Rossman have made a major contribution to our understanding of this glamorous and intriguing star. With great skill, they meet the reader's expectation of being told a captivating story, while staying true to the demands of scholarship. The book is extremely well-researched, and as thoroughly documented as any scholarly user could want, but never dull or plodding. Supplementing the text is a generous selection of striking photos."
books,2 of 13,1.0,Absolutley Awful,"Not since ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" have I labored so much to get through a book.  I finally quit at page 35, unable to go on.  A complete non-sequitur, stream of consciousness mess, best describes this book.  Why this publication came so highly acclaimed I will never know.  Do yourself a favor........if you feel inclined to give it a read, go to your local library.  The paper and ink has already been wasted, don't waste your money too.  A better title would be, ""The Tao of Poop"""

books,11 of 74,1.0,The horrible effects of cancer,"I used to admire this woman.  She was smart.  She inspired me when I was young.  It is a shame, however, to see her intellectual decline in her last years.  Was this the effect cancer had on her brain?  First, I can't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called ""The Force of Reason.""   She appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality.  Second, she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts.  For instance, she quietly forgot the role of Christianity in the Conquest of the Americas and the slaughter of the Indian races.  Or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the European powers.  And what about the survival of Catholicism in Spain in spite of eight centuries  of Muslim domination?  Yes, there were churches and  synagogues in Muslim Spain.  This manifesto doesn't look very different from those fascists wrote about Jews in Europe in the 1930s.   Poor woman."

But what most people do not think of, that Hiaasen has lived through, is the crazy aftermath of said hurricane.  Lack of fresh water, food and ice cannot drive away those hell bent on insurance fraud, roofing scams, or the crazed tourist that wants to capitalize on some original footage of the events as they unfold."
books,,5.0,Every home should have one,"This was a splurge purchase for us and the best hundred bucks or thereabouts we've spent in a long time.  The intro is fascinating and the comics, reproduced full size, rather than the shrunken newspaper versions, are brilliant.  We have no problems getting our son up in the mornings as he relishes the prospect of reading Calvin & Hobbes once he is ready for school.  He can't wait for it to snow so that we can fill the yard with Snow Goons.  Go on - go mad and treat yourself"
books,16 of 18,5.0,A durable masterpiece,"Time alters all things.  The resultant changes can be decay, or tedium/passe, or at the opposite end of the spectrum the changes can be enhancing as a patina on fine wood.  Andrei Makine's DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS has happily acquired a literary patina that makes this brief but crystalline memoir of childhood even more of a joy to read after a few years on the shelf.  Makine has the rare ability to weave wholly credible stories with unforgetable characters while at the same time measuring his prose like poetry.  We are to suppose this is an autobiography, but it is far more than the journey of a nascent writer becoming a man.  This is the essence of the Russian mind embellished by the great fortune of having early exposure to the beauty of France by means of recalling summers with Charlotte, a French born grandmother who nourishes the imagination and history of the writer to the point of delirium.  All that has happened to and in Russia from the time of the Tsars to the present is presented in such a way that the grisly realities are always balanced by the homage to love of fatherland.  Makine is a stunning writer and is still adding to our contemporary literature in ways that secure him a place among the geniuses of the word.  Read and indulge your mind and your senses"
books,6 of 23,4.0,Informative but casts too wide a net.,"Bruce Bawer's book is informative and covers quite a lot of ground in its description of the insidious nature of radical Islam in Europe and how the political elite are more enamoured with political power over a propagandised electorate instead of applying themselves to the defence of freedom. But that is what European style government is all about despite the contemporary terrorism of radical Islam, and is--like democracy--the antithesis of freedom."
books,,5.0,Best gift I've purchased in a long time!,"I purchased this audiobook for my husband, who listens to books while he works. He never watches movies a second time and he never listens to books twice. But after checking this out from the library, he talked about this book so much he ended up checking it again. He continued to fill me in on the life story of John Adams and told me several times that he wouldn't mind owning this one! Needless to say, he made it easy for me to decide on an anniversary gift this year and he couldn't have been happier"
books,,4.0,Windfall from an unknown source,"Usually people don't complain about receiving money from an anonymous source, but Investigator Kinsey Millhone knows that she needs to report the $5000 which has mysteriously appeared in her bank account.  No one seems to know where the money has come from and soon it is all part of a problem that involves Kinsey as a suspect in an insurance fraud case.  As she delves into the investigation, she uncovers a prominent family's secrets and continues to get into trouble herself.  As usual, Kinsey's investigation causes physical danger to her, until she hunts down the perpetrator.  This is another good read from Sue Grafton"
books,5 of 6,4.0,Read This BEFORE your next trip to Wal-Mart!,"This book by author/researcher John Dicker criticizes the growing retail domination of the mammoth chain store, Wal-Mart. He argues that it has destroyed, and continues to crush, smaller local companies like Toys 'R Us, Vons, etc. by exploiting workers through very low wages. Dicker presents many credible points throughout his book and lists the various references for his extensive source material."

books,10 of 69,1.0,A joke,"This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it"
books,9 of 9,4.0,An easy introduction to Bioidentical Hormones,"I have been treating patients with bioidentical hormones for many years without having many books I could recommend to my patients. I was glad when this book came out, because it has a pretty good overview ot this therapy in easily understood terms. There are two things I particularly like. One is that  she interviews a few  different experts on the subject, demonstrating the ""art of medicine"" that is needed in this type of treatment. The other aspect I particularly liked is where she reasons with her doctor to put her back on hormones after she was treated for Breast Cancer. Her argument was well thought out, and is a good example of a patient/doctor collaboration in healthcare. Some of the style of the book is a bit cutesy, but overall I believe it does a good service for the women who read it."
books,11 of 13,1.0,Save your Money!!,"The book itself is not bad, information is good, somewhat dated in parts, but good.  The problem is, nothing new is in the book.  All of the information can be found at one of several websites like quicken.com, or bankrate.com, etc.  Most of the information is pretty common sense.  If you have to get the book or don't want to look on the internet for the information, then at least go to the library and check it out and save your money"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Paradise!,"With the chilly season setting in here in Washington State, the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long.  I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there.  This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader."
books,12 of 15,5.0,An inspiring book for a jaded collector,"I haven't gotten excited by a cookbook in years but Sunday Suppers was just the thing to get me back to the kitchen cooking new dishes. I love her sense of food and  her unpretentious writing. Also, her focus on local foods from farmers and her simple ways to prepare them -- never too much nor too little. Thank you Suzanne, for a great book."
books,,5.0,A Wonderful Book for any Child & New Parent!,"Hi I am the mother of twin preemie fraternal twins which are now 8 months old. My oldest twin weighed 2.4 and the youngest 4.8 lbs. My boys were hospitalized for 6 weeks. When we brought them home I thought wow, I really have them on the right track. My youngest boy would whale everynight no matter what. I tried swaddling, holding, everything, nothing worked. Until, someone gave me this wonderful book."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Best book for quants new to finance,"I recently entered the field of quantitative finance from physics, and this book has been by far the best resource as both a learning tool and reference.  Its bredth of coverage is outstanding, covering topics as simple as bond yields and zero rates, to sophsticated libor market models, weather derivatives, bermudan swaptions, etc.  While a bit wordy at times, Hull does present all the mathematics in a tractible manner.  Books with more mathematical sophistication, such as Brigo & Mercurio, while interesting, are far less useful on the trading floor."
books,15 of 15,5.0,Worth its weight in gold many times over...,"This book changed my life and changed the way I trade.  Part of the reason I can say that is the fact that I developed my all-time most reliable and profitable trade from Elder's simple explanations.  Fully 80% of my trades are based on a formation that occurs using two indicators described in this book.  Elder even identifies the formation as being ""the strongest signal in technical analysis.""  I will certainly agree, though it took me some time to find the ideal market and time-frame for it.   If you trade futures, stocks, or currencies with Candlesticks, the secret is in this book.  It gave me the edge I needed to become consistently profitable.   I own more than 60 trading related books (those are just the keepers) and I think what makes Elder stand out is the fact that he is/was a successful trader for many years and that the content of this book is the hard-won wisdom of those years.  This is not a book written by some infomercial peddler who makes his living selling trading ""courses.""  I chuckle when I see the price for this book is $47.25 because I would have counted it a steal at a hundred times that.  To unlock the strategies in Trading for a Living you will have to adapt them to your own trading style, vehicle, and funds.  I agree with another reviewer who said this book is for a person who is more than an amateur but not yet a pro.  I believe that the techniques used by most very sophisticated professional traders are built on the indicators and principles found in this book."
books,1 of 1,4.0,"From a queer, young girl to an attractive auburnette schoolteacher...","Even though L.M. Montgomery did not intend Anne of Green Gables to be a series, she still captivates with her eager readers in Anne of Avonlea."
books,8 of 9,5.0,The political is personal...,"Though she's known to many as a voice on NPR's ""This American Life"" and to many more (even if they don't realize it) as the voice of Violet in the hit Pixar film ""The Incredibles,"" I mainly came to know her through her written works.  Having read her book ""The Partly Cloudy Patriot"" and loving the unique way she blends history, pop culture and humor with autobiography, I couldn't resist Sarah Vowell's essay collection ""Take the Cannoli.""  To put it mildly, I was impressed.  Even though many of these pieces were delivered on the radio, they translate to book form without a hint of strain.  Whereas a book written by a comedian like George Carlin often comes off as a clumsily assembled blog, Ms. Vowell takes the time to put her thoughts down with clarity, and therefore her ideas and personality shine through."
books,,4.0,"Insightful, well-written analysis","I've read several bestsellers on the implications of the internet, but found this one a notch above the rest. Whilst others are often totally skewed by commercial and technological aspects, this one went a lot deeper and touched on the Meta changes underlying society. But far from being a grand, generalist thesis, Lewis grounds his observations in real flesh-and-blood stories that are highly readable. His experience as a professional writer shines through on every page."

books,5 of 5,5.0,Great for first-timers with a kitchen,"I'm a junior in college, and my parents bought this cookbook for me as a gift for my first apartment.  My experience with cooking hasn't really gone past heating up chicken cutlets in the oven, so I was a little wary of using an actual cookbook.  But this book is really useful."
books,0 of 1,2.0,Lord John and the Private Matter,"I had loved the Outlander books and I felt a sense of loss when I finished them.  Natually, the next step was to get the Lord John book.  Even though it's unrelated to the Outlander books, I thought it would be just as engrossing and entertaining.  I was very dissappointed.  The story was not that interesting and the characters were not very well developed or likable.  I read the book to the end, but I really couldn't care less how it ended or what happened to these people.  I would not recommend this book to anyone"
books,10 of 11,5.0,A must for parents with down syndrome children,"We were told, in the delivery room, that our son had down syndrome.  That was not what upset us, it was the pediatric specialist telling us all the bad things that ""would happen"" to our son.  We were desperately looking for information on D.S., but nothing was really clear that we saw on line.  Our doctor at Child Development had this book so we went to Borders and got it.  It is written in a way that makes it easier for someone to understand all the possibilities.  Basically, a D.S. child can do anything as long as he/she has the opportunity and support.  Our first hurdle was the V.S.D., he had heart surgery at 4 months as he was unable to put on weight or even keep the weight he had gained.  He has gained 7 pounds and is 7 months. We play with him all the time in ways to develope his muscle tone and his P.T. says, in one month, he has done a major improvement.  We cross each bridge as it comes but we make it fun.  We constantly us the book for reference when we have a question or need a clarification, it is always on our kitchen table"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Timeless Classic and Warning,"Thucydides (c.460-c.400 BC) was an insider during the Peloponesian War.  He was an Athenian commander who was dismissed after his men lost a battle in spite of the fact of his previous successes.  This book was an attempt at an honest historical assessment of the Peloponesian War which was not only destructive to the Athenians and  eventually the Spartans, but the war was also ruinous to their allies.  The important theme of this book is that Athenian hubris replaced practicle thinking leading to Athenian imperialism and war."
books,7 of 11,1.0,A little silly,"I just completed this book yesterday and I must confess if it was any longer I might not have.  While it was mildly entertaining, it contains little that is new or particularly informative.  The book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in Churchill's life.  Many of the comparisons seem strained.  In fact, comparing Churchill's almost single-handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition, seems inappropriate and a little silly.      It's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business, or otherwise. These kernals are relatively simple and (it seems to me) obvious.  It begs the question, Why, exactly, do we need a book such as this?       The people most apt to pick-up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for Churchill.  If so, those people will likely have read books which are more informative, historically significant, insightful and generally worthwhile.  If this is your first introduction to Churchill, do not let it be your last.  Overall, I think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time"
books,,2.0,Underwater close encounter of the boring kind,"This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget."
books,1 of 1,5.0,A not-so-grim tale that will leave you gasping for air (and dry land),"When your last name is Baudelaire, it is a known fact that you will somehow stumble upon trouble, no matter how hard you may try and avoid it. When you're last name is Baudelaire and you're an orphan, stumbling upon trouble increases tenfold. Which is why the Baudelaire orphans (Violet, Klaus, and Sunny) know instantly after they begin floating along the Stricken Stream that trouble is lurking around some vicious corner. However, as they are not dolphins, seals, or fish, they did not expect their next bout of trouble to take place underwater. But, alas, that is exactly where they find themselves on their next dreadful adventure. Having come across a submarine that is filled with three crew members (Captain Widdershins, his step-daughter Fiona, and, lo-and-behold the Baudelaire Orphans old pal, Phil), the Baudelaire's enter the underwater vehicle, and begin their next journey. Within a short while, the three orphans learn that Captain Widdershins is a member of V.F.D., and they quickly realize that he is on their side, willing to help them discover the truth about the fire that took their beloved parents lives. However, when the orphans, along with Fiona (a young mycologist), prepare for a bit of deep-sea diving, they soon find that young Sunny has been infected with Medusoid Mycelium (a deadly fungi). Now, the siblings are searching for a way to save their baby sister from a very certain death, without many supplies. As if that weren't difficult enough for the Baudelaire's to endure, they have just discovered that Count Olaf is now trailing them under the sea, and plans on capturing them, and (you guessed it) claiming their fortune as his own."
books,3 of 12,5.0,Over a hundred fifty pieces by nearly eighty contributors span nearly a hundred years,"Any collection strong in entertainment and movie history, especially college-level holdings, will want to have AMERICAN MOVIE CRITICS: AN ANTHOLOGY FROM THE SILENTS UNTIL NOW in their collection. It's the first anthology to categorize, define and explore movie reviewing as a discipline of its own: chapters blend a history of the rose of movies with a concurrent survey of the rise of movie critics and reviewing methods, tracking changes in methods, contributions of notable critics over the decades, and including quotes and samples from some of today's best. Over a hundred fifty pieces by nearly eighty contributors span nearly a hundred years."
books,,5.0,Facinating!,"I can't believe I didn't know anything about this time in US History before.  The Chicago fair as background to a serial killer is facinating.  This book is very well written.  You'd think a book about architecture might be dry, but its really not at all.  Highly recommend this book.  Its a slo a great book for a book club"
books,1 of 2,5.0,in a response...,"I do have a comment on history content, in response to one of other reviews I read -let's keep in mind that, if it wasn't for Elizabeth I there would be no empire to pass along to James I-England would be swallowed up by either France or Spain. Surely, Elizabeth I made a few mistakes like every other monarch, but they fade out in comparison to her achievements. She truly did build an empire, and serves as a great example of a true leader."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Better than Good Night Moon,"This was a favorite of my daughter's, and she's 42 now!  While she loved all the Margaret Wise Brown books, as they came out, this always remained the favorite. It must be in the genes, because the two oldest grandchildren, now out of college, loved it the best, too.  And now, the third grandchild, a 5-year-old, is reading it to herself at night! Oddly, while one can find ""Good Night Moon"" in any book store, ""A Child's Goodnight Book"" is never there.  Until Amazon, I always had to order it from the publisher.  We include it in the new-baby presents we give to all the youngsters we know, and always get rave reviews from the new parents. I think I've ordered at least two dozen copies from Amazon, since you all came along.  Thanks"
books,,5.0,A wake-up call for economists,"Since the Keynesian revolution the economics profession has been busy writing up mathematical models of incentives that show how IMF and World Bank loans, free trade deals, ""fiscal policy"" or ""game theory"" can be used by governments to generate economic growth. Hernando de Soto's Mystery of Capital is a slap in the face for every economist that has ever had a high-paid position in the countless agencies built to promote growth. It turns out that the classical economists (and their Austrian school heirs) have been right all along, that the source of economic growth is individual businessmen. And what can these individuals do when it takes a year of full-time work and years of savings paid out in bribes to get a legitimate business license? Nothing. The only people that can do business in these countries are the already-wealthy and well-connected."
books,,5.0,Great Story!!!!,I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them

books,2 of 2,4.0,"An off the wall idea, but is it really that far fetched? A gripping, thrilling novel...","This book is a great book, don't get me wrong, but has a slow beginning, slow enough that I actually became discouraged and thought about putting the book away, but once the book really gets going it is thrilling and very fast paced. If you can make it through the initial crawl and into the heart of the book you will not, at all, be disappointed for sticking with this novel. The concept of this book is fairly simple; something in the scientific world is being done that the church strongly disproves of, enough disproval that it drives them to kill. The victims are all the same: a mother and a male child under the age of 4. The victims that are targeted all have one thing in common, they all went to a clinic that was doing top of the end research and was very successful at allowing those that were infertile or too old the possibility to have children. The clinic helps out those who want to carry children and are otherwise deemed untreatable, and also carrying out research that could alter the world forever, an extremely delicate subject that threatens to change the way our entire history, as human beings, is viewed. Through the whole debacle many lives are lost in hope of protecting something deemed sacred."

books,10 of 12,2.0,Much to be desired,"I know a lot of people have written some really rave reviews about this book, but personally think this book sucked out loud.  The only reason the book could have possibly won the  LAMBDA Literary Award for 2004 is that it must have been the only gay novel released that year."
books,2 of 5,5.0,A Hat in The Crossing,"The Border Trilogy continues with THE CROSSING.  In the book's early going, sixteen-year-old Billy Parham visits an eccentric old Mexican man who is rumored to be a brujo.  Billy seeks this man's advise regarding the ways of wolves as Billy has been stymied in his attempts to trap a wolf who has wandered into New Mexico from Mexico.  As Billy is helping the old man rise up from his bed, McCarthy writes ""The boy almost put his hat on the bed but he caught himself.""  Now what is that supposed to mean, you may ask.  Perhaps some western readers of McCarthy may know the reference here, but for rest of you, here goes."
books,9 of 13,5.0,A Crazy Masterpiece,"This is yet another Chinese puzzle of a book with stories within stories within stories, reminiscent of Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer and just as crazy. A soldier who travels through a haunted land and spends the night romping with two lovely sisters and awakens with a rotting corpse on either side; Rosicrucians and the Wandering Jew and a whole spectrum of memorable characters and ghostly goings on--penned by a genius Polish Count and pioneering aeronaut who commited suicide with a silver bullet to the brain, this book is the mental equivalent of climbing rocks without a safety, or flipping 360's on a trail bike, or snow-boarding down a cliff--you've got to keep the mind sharp and keep balanced on the cusp of the page or you will wipe out badly!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! Get it, you Extreme Dudes!  Oh Yeah"
books,1 of 2,2.0,"Crops, Crops and More Crops","I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, ""Collapse"" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK"

Bosch remained transfixed by it, pulling the file several times a year in the hope to discover some new information, something missed, a fresh lead, just anything, wanting more than ever to give closure to this victim's parents and also to himself, but the criminal remains still at large, one who still walks the streets and this makes Bosch nervous."
books,10 of 10,5.0,"Big Hurricane, Big Scams, Big Trouble","Given the recent hurricanes Katrina and Rita that hit the United States in the past year, 'Stormy Weather,' by Carl Hiaasen, seemed like a timely read.

books,5 of 6,5.0,Extremely Practical,"I was waiting in line at the college bookstore, (buying a textbook), and this book was prominently featured.

The book is a page-turner.  I'm so glad that books like this exist for teenagers, especially gay teenagers.  And for 40-somethings like myself, who still struggle with ""what do people think"" issues.  I certainly learned something from this book, and enjoyed the process as well"

As simply a portrait of a developing young artist, &quot;Sleepwalk and Other Stories&quot; is somewhat interesting, but certainly not a fully realized or especially enjoyable book"

books,12 of 16,5.0,Positive Networking and Social Capital.,"Putnam has hit the nail right on the head. Public policy makers world-wide have taken note. His constructs of 'bonding'and 'bridging' to the broader community through social networks to add value, or social capital, to society have gained wide currency.  His research is exhaustive, more than necessary perhaps to make the case for disengagement of citizens. But, he has confirmed empirically what so many know intuitively to be true, hence the appeal of his findings.  His recent work with John Helliwell published in the 2004 proceedings of the Royal Society on social capital and well-being, reported in the media as the science of happiness and the object in my own work on positive networking, advances the discipline even further. Positive networking works, it takes leadership and, when done right, adds social capital to the community. Putnam's work is compelling. His arguements are powerful...highly recommended"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Bending over backwards for students who don't care,"This book contains a lot of useful information for the new teacher or the burned out teacher who needs a boost. It's useful in the sense that it tries to get teachers to stop taking negative beahvior personally (usually it's not about the teacher) and to use positive reinforcement as much as possible--always a good idea whenever you are trying to change behavior, be it animal or human! But I had to laugh out loud when the author suggests praising the consistently tardy student for being in class ""most of the time."" Give me a break!"
books,2 of 4,5.0,AN OUTSTANDING FOLLOW-UP FOR ALL READERS,"Deshi builds on the outstanding work of Sensei. The characters of Dr. Conner Burke and his teacher are more deeply and richly drawn. Donohue reveals more about the martial artists who train and study not to fight and spar for trophies but to fight and spar with their own lives. Like great mysteries, the mystery plot is really secondary to the mysterious inner workings of human beings. On that mark, Donohue does an amazing job. He captures a world that may surprise people who know the martial arts only from the one dimensional, chop-socky Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee/Jet Li movies (which I enjoy too). As a black belt myself, I can attest that his insights and conflicts are authentic and well reasoned. Let's hope the series continues because it has the makings of a real classic."
books,3 of 4,4.0,"An excellent beginning from a strong, new NH voice!","The Singer's Crown captivated me from the start, with the nefarious uncle, and later the scheming grandmother, coupled with a variety of plot lines author Isaak effortlessly keeps interwoven until the surprising end. ""There's magic in them, thar family jewels?""  I was invested in her secondary characters and enjoyed how she let them be strong in their own right.  This wasn't strictly a good-vs-evil plot--the hero was young and distracted by what he lacked, and the heroine was overawed by her protectors.  Nevertheless, it made a compelling read, and I look forward to Isaak's next book with eager anticipation"

books,5 of 7,5.0,Transfiguration in Print,"I read this book in 1980, and each chapter of it still stands out in my mind in glittering bas-relief against all I read before or have read since. What stands out the most, however, is that my thinking changed after reading this book. Everything since reading it has been inevitably processed through its filter, which has quite simply changed my life. Perhaps a first-reading today would not have an equal effect; in 1980 it was timely. Things we take for granted now were difficult to conceptualize then--the internet, for instance. But I'll leave it for contemporary readers to decide whether G�del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is as eternal as the title claims. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. I can say without doubt that my life would have been different if I had not read it at that time."
books,13 of 14,4.0,The basics about multi-family properties,"This book is very informative if you are a beginner to the multi family world.  For anyone that has already dealt with multi family, then you do not need this book.  However, Berges other book, real estate finance is a good review for the seasoned apartment owner.  In that book he goes over some key performance and efficiency ratios that everyone should be aware of when dealing with multi family properties."

After buying a copy used, I was so impressed that I bought seven more new copies, one for each of my adult kids.  I'm sorry I can't describe the book in more detail, but each page is a different detail.  If you want a wealth of ... well, just a wealth--I recommend this book"

books,2 of 2,4.0,Not just about money!!,"I found Built to Last to be an analytical look at the intangibles of success.  Core development and maintenance, personal growth, employee development and more, highlight the ""outside the bottom line"" look into an organization lasting longer than any one leader's tenure of influence.  Although I don't agree with every aspect of the book I still rate this high due to its ability to stimulate positive thinking"
books,6 of 7,5.0,A real find,"Here's a book that not many people know about which should be read by all. It was really just what I needed to read, having just dropped out of university myself. Also, does anyone else think that this book must have greatly influenced Hemingway? It sounds just like him, and he says in A Moveable Feast that he was reading lots of Russian stuff at the start of his career. I realize it might just be that the translator liked Hemingway, but even so it's amazing how much it ends up reading like one of his novels and is so unlike the rest of Tolstoy"
books,2 of 3,5.0,First &amp; Final mutual fund book,"My first and final book on mutual funds. I've read several others, but keep returning to this one. The end of chapter summaries are invaluable. It is a tougher read than most and Mutual Funds for Dummies ins easier and in the same vein"
books,7 of 7,4.0,"Good intro to psychology of persuation, NOT a guide book on how to persuade.","A very intersting introduction to the psychology of persuation, how everything from car salesman, education, religion, through to cults manipulate their victims.

books,4 of 4,4.0,A million to one!,"War of the Worlds has come and gone in many different incarnations but I kinda just knew that none of them were really being faithful to HG Wells' original story, especially the mis-judged Spielberg/Cruise flick. So I decided to give the book a shot since it was cheap and this particular printing by The Modern Library looked rather sleek and sexy. I know it's sad, but I like my books to look good."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent abridgement and modernization of a classic story,"I consider ""The War of the Worlds"" to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time. It has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time. The original story is set in England at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story."

books,5 of 8,4.0,Read this book to learn how to detect a liar.,"This book was a great help to me in being able to detect when people are lying.

books,10 of 10,5.0,Awesome!,"I was still left scratching my head after having read twice and attempting the problems in K&R.  Literally, I was excited as I read Kochan's book.  His presentation is so clear, with the right balance of explanation and examples without being too wordy/vague/simplistic? (SAMS C in 21 Days) or too terse (K&R)."
books,111 of 116,1.0,&quot;The Authoritative Guide&quot;?   Give me a break!,"This book should have been an short magazine article. The authors basically dissect one concept over and over and over: change is disruptive. There is very little useful information in this book. It points out all of  the obvious and frequently-stated problems that come with change -  productivity suffers, commitment is lost, etc., etc., etc., but gives no  insight in how to fix the problems (unless you count these golden nuggets-  &quot;Keep your eye on the ball&quot; and &quot;Provide direction&quot;).   The one chapter that I hoped would shed some light on tactics -  &quot;Integration Project Management&quot; - was pure fluff. It offered  such pearls of wisdom as &quot;It is helpful to look at the integration  process as a logical sequence of steps designed to help bring the two  organizations together.&quot; Not only is this a &quot;Duh&quot; statement,  but it shows up in chapter 8! I would expect to read something like that in  the introduction. And chapters 5 and 6 state that you should evaluate key  talent in the aquired firm - but no where in these chapters does it tell  you how to do it! I guess you have call up Pritchett &amp; Associates (and  fork over big $$) for the details. My only guess is that the authors kept  the book generic on purpose so that companies would call and ask about  their consulting services. My advice: save your money for a real book, and  just call up Pritchett &amp; Associates for their marketing literature"
books,,5.0,My favorite haunted house story,"Isolated, brooding Hill House is reputed to be haunted. One summer, four people gather there to investigate. Dr. Montague wants to prove the existence of hauntings scientifically. Lovely Theodora needs a place to stay for the summer. Luke, the dashing young heir to the house, is supposed to keep an eye on the estate for his aunt. And Eleanor has been waiting all her life for something to happen - something like Hill House."
books,14 of 19,1.0,I suggest a pass,"SharePoint as a technology is a tremendous product.  This book, however, does not come close to doing it justice.  I found the verbiage to be incoherent in various places, and occasionally terms were simply never defined.  Further, at one point the author says ""At the time we had to go to press with this chapter, the information on how to use Microsoft SharePoint Server 2003 extranets was in the beta stages of being written""...  When I purchased this book about SharePoint products and technologies, I assumed the author would be able to write about SharePoint portal server 2003 without requiring other authors to pave the way.  In short, this book seems to be a repurposing of information from other sources in a pell-mell fashion.  Consequently I cannot recommend it"
books,10 of 14,4.0,Card counting and beating the casinos at their own game.,"In the mid-1990s, a team of American science students took on the might of the Las Vegas casinos, and came home with millions of dollars. Hardworking engineering students during the week, they became high-rolling gamblers by the weekend and proved that, in one game at least, the house doesn't always win. The game was blackjack, and the students were from the world-renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Their audacious winnings marked the climax of an arms race between casino and player that began 40 years earlier with maths professor Edward Thorp. He realized that the one feature of blackjack that made it different from other casino games also made it possible to beat. The unique way blackjack was played, the odds were not always the same in every round. After each hand is played, the used cards are put to one side, and not shuffled back into the deck. They are effectively removed from the pool of available cards in the next round. So in any given hand, the odds of getting an ace will decrease if an ace has been played in previous rounds. Aces are beneficial to the player, so having a smaller proportion of aces in the deck shifts the odds further in favour of the house. Previous gamblers had realized this fact, but no one had the insight to come up with a practical system to take advantage of this phenomenon."

I was getting my hair done and asked her to keep me under the dryer as long as possible because I wanted to sit there and read and read..."
books,14 of 16,4.0,"A Painfully Accurate, Essential Read","Devour this book in small bites, or you're likely to choke on the raw truth of it.  Between these covers, Palast demonstrates repeatedly why EVERYone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts.  While I'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations, the policies and actions carried out by the Bush Administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of Palast's claims in broad daylight."

books,10 of 12,5.0,"A NO-BRAINER, FIVE-STAR, READ-IT-NOW NARRATIVE","Peter Heather's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is an exciting book because it peels away the pasted-on theories of the fall of the Roman Empire and replaces them with a logical, coherent theory of what happened. For some reason, known only to my shrink, I am a fan of the Roman Empire. And so, while reading THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, I kept rooting for the Romans to win, hoping that the conclusion might turn out differently and the Empire would survive. But, alas, it did not. Still, it's that kind of book: it reads like a novel, with clear, easy-to-read prose. The next time you travel to Hungary think of Attila the Hun whose fierce, stretched-skull Huns, wielding deadly bows that could pierce armor from horseback a hundred-plus yards distant, smacked into the Germanic tribes to the west and sent them carooming like billiard balls across the Roman frontier. I won't spoil any more of the plot for you because this well-researched and entertaining book deserves your full ruminations. (There are 16 maps and the many footnotes are tucked away in the end papers, out of sight.) THE FALL is a no-brainer, five-star, read-it-now narrative that makes the  political, economic, military and social aspects of the fourth and fifth centuries seem like they happened yesterday, and that the Romans of these times, whose orderly world was slowly unraveling into a kind of chaotic darkness, were people much like you and I, struggling to save their way of life in vexing, dangerous times."
books,3 of 3,4.0,History's Most Lovable Bloodthirsty Tyrant,"Mainstream historians may object to some of the claims in this book, but John Man has created quite a readable mix of travelogue and history. This is more a work of interpretation, rather than direct research, as Man has combined his own past learning about Genghis Khan and the Mongols with his modern-day travels to Mongolia in search of surviving relics. So do not expect newly detailed research breakthroughs, because this is one of those ""living history"" books. One particular problem is that Man uses a lot of conjecture and opinionating when tackling gaps or contradictions in the historical record. But in the end, we do get a very good summary of all the present knowledge on Genghis and his descendants, and Man engagingly discusses this very intriguing and complex historical personage. This especially applies to how Genghis was surely a genius in military strategy and administration, and was a remarkable leader of men, while also being responsible for the destruction of dozens of classic cities and the slaughter of probably a few million people. Man also discusses the sheer hugeness of the Mongols' empire-building practices, why these once-anarchic nomads decided to destroy every settled civilization in the known world then return to their simple pastoral lives, and how Genghis has been deified as both a god and a devil by multiple societies ever since. Add to this Man's exploration of the modern landscape and the Mongols' ongoing influence, and this conjectural but still very readable book really shows what made Genghis and his boys tick.

books,9 of 9,5.0,one tasty orange,"True or false: is advertising obsolete? Fallon and Senn say true---unless it changes. And they go about showing how it must change in recounting their best campaigns(with some intellectual honesty in mentioning their losers). The Big Ideas: don't steal a competitor's emotion, find your own; ads must bear an A to B connection in more revenue generation; take risks to survive because incremental change will kill you. The chapter on Lee Jeans is one of the best: trust the focus groups when they have passion(here, teenagers want to feel indestructible in their jeans); don't ape the competition(the strong desire to be sexy like levi's);  don't be afraid to go to your roots(here, bring back a doll icon from the compnay's past); and know, above all else, that emotions drive decisions---the reason is tacked on later. They also talk about how they run their shop---fire  prima dona employees or unreasonable clients; understand what is worth fighting over; undertstand that creativity is team driven; believe in a few core idea and push them over and again"
books,5 of 5,5.0,allegory of death,"Written as he was fighting the illness that would kill him, this is Bukowski's farewell to his readers. As he said elsewhere of his hero Cline, ""they ripped his guts out and he made them laugh"". And this is what he proceeds to to in Pulp. Portraying himself as a blundering, idiotic detective, he pokes the ultimate fun at his own work as a writer. He hasn't even begun to solve any of the mysteries of life and yet he is about to die a meaningless death (in the allegory, the lease on his office is expiring), surrounded by even worse clowns and failures than he is. Personifications of his earlier selves are also there (the gambling addict mailman, see Post Office) and he resolutely thrashes them in the most poignant self-critique you'll ever find anywhere. Believe it or not, this book is a sublime act of bravery in the face of insurmountable odds"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Read,"I really liked this book, it was a great fast read.  The only thing was the main character was very emotional, a little more than I'm used to in a male character, he seemed to cried a lot.  Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it"
books,10 of 12,5.0,Eternal Arts meets the New Millenium,"I started reading Orhan Pamuk's My Name is Red in 2003 when a friend lent to me while abroad.  It was right after I had taken a course in Islamic art so a lot of the information about the popularity of Persian painting was fresh in my mind.  When I finally got around to reading the whole book it was several years later, the art history information was less fresh in my brain, but that did not diminish the perfect wonder that is in this book."
books,5 of 5,5.0,Connecting the Dots,"I read this book in record time.  Greg Palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government'.  I am ashamed that our own US media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government.  From Iran to Iran Contra to Iraq and the Oil fields, from the Halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm.  Thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of ALL the people.

books,8 of 8,4.0,Not just for solo chicks,"I'm married and bought this book for some ideas on what to do while my husband is out of town on business trips or playing weekend warrior.  I disagree with the last review; I think the whole idea for the book (we'll give you the ideas, you plan it out) is right on.  After all, isn't it supposed to be about getting out of the house and into life?  Nor do I agree with the sentiment that going to town hall meetings are &quot;not fun at all.&quot;  Maybe getting involved with city politics isn't your idea of a good time, but what's one woman's junk is another woman's treasure.  Overall, a very good read with even better ideas"

books,0 of 1,2.0,Completely Underwhelmed,"I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite.  I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling.  Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes.  Methinks PS could do better."
books,4 of 7,5.0,Checking the Pulse,"This book is a collection of newspaper columns and journal entries that Friedman wrote before and after the September 11th attacks.  Friedman is very familiar with the Middle East, having been a news correspondent in Beirut and Jerusalem for ten years before becoming foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times.  Although he himself had stressed that one consequence of globalization has been the creation of super-empowered individuals with a grudge against the United States, and that bin Laden was just such an individual (The Lexus and the Olive Tree), even Friedman did not see it coming on September 11th, 2001.  This book features reprints of Friedman's columns analyzing the reasons why the September 11th attacks happened, and the reaction in the following months throughout the Islamic world.  The book also includes a short journal section, in which Friedman describes his travels in the Middle East while he was collecting material for his columns."

When you put together a guide to one of the most powerful and useful pieces of software in any company's arsenal with the genius of Conrad Carlberg to lead even the neophyte through the intracacies of sales forecasting, the combination is downright unbeatable. Carlberg has won awards for a string of some of the best ""how-to"" books on EXCEL and Microsoft Office. This new one gets my personal award for ""best EXCEL guide of the year."

books,,5.0,Elegantly written novel,"Peter Carey is an amazing writer, and THEFT is a charming novel about the art world. The satirical insights are very apt and often laugh-out-loud hilarious, and Carey has a wonderful way of displaying his characters' pretensions and foibles without belittling them. Somehow, when i read Carey, i am reminded of Iris Murdoch and Nathalie Sarraute, as they also set their novels in ""heady"" milieus of the arts and academia, and were adept at skewering pretensions without losing affection"
books,0 of 1,2.0,Mostly unintelligible,"I have been a fan of Peter Carey forever and have read all his work. His work, however,has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book. Weird characters  and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense. But for the rest of us---I am really sorry to report the book is not readable. I quit after reading about 2/3ds and for me that is unheard of. I feel like I have lost at good friend"
books,5 of 5,5.0,A Wonderful Resource for Those in Need of Support/Guidance,"I singled out this book as I felt I'd come to a fork in the road of my life. I could choose to be bitter after the premature birth and death of my son or I could try to seek out better ways to live my now very different life. I started this book dubious of its content. I expected to be lectured. Instead I found myself reading with an open mouth; shocked at how accurately my loss was explained. It was as if this wonderfully gifted rabbi had invisibly witnessed the events of my life, the times when my relatives would say the dumbest and most cruel comments. Instead of being talked at, I found I was reading a book a kind friend had written just for me. I am not religious or spiritual, I guess you could say I'm confused, however his book has opened my eyes to a different, kinder religion than the one I had always felt was judgemental."

Joy Luck club is a fascinating work: it is full of humor and deep philosophic thoughts that reach in the middle of your heart, it is a great source of information about Chinese culture, Chinese immigration and what it is like to be born on the edge created by two cultures. It makes you realize that the phenomenon of motherhood and ""daughterhood"" is international and yet every single couple of mother-and-daughter in the world is very special and different. The book offers so much to the reader that it is hard to put a finger on what makes it rich: its easy-flowing and humorous style, its incredible depth, or the content that is full of adventures that are almost mistical"

books,2 of 3,5.0,Choosing to Pursue the Optimal Technologies,"All of us have a bias when it comes to technology and the future.  One of the great strengths of this book is that it makes each reader aware of her or his bias and provides perspective on other dimensions that limit or encourage future technology development.  Do we see technology as unbounded . . . or creating new problems that threaten to overwhelm us?  Do we see the race with population and pollution as unwinnable . . . or as easily won?  Do we look at the giant technologies . . . or do we look for what is small and beautifully efficient?  With the expanded view of all these points of view, the wise technologist or executive can choose more promising directions."
books,,5.0,Did you like John Adams?,"I can't add much to what's already been said in these reviews.  McCullough is a fantastic writer, and Truman is one of the most under-appreciated figures of the 20th century.  He lived during a pivotal time in American history, and presided over some of its greatest moments.  If you read John Adams and liked it, you'll like Truman.  (If you liked Truman, may I recommend John Adams.)  As per his usual style, McCullough takes his time in telling the story (the book is nearly 1000 pages!), and stops to dwell on the characters involved.  He does it so well.  This is the sort of book that even casual readers of history could appreciate"

books,16 of 28,1.0,A dismal disappointment,"I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has ""stuffed your feelings"" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one."

books,2 of 5,5.0,Beginning book in the series!,Daring to Dream is the first book in this must read series.  I started it thinking I'd read a few short chapters before calling it the night...I was wrong...Could not put this book down and believe me I tried several times but just couldn't do it.  I was tired at work the next day but a tiredness that was well worth it

books,5 of 5,4.0,Uneven but still worth reading,"First the good news. This book contains some of Heinlein's most interesting speculations, some of his most delightfully outlandish ideas (there is a cat who really can dematerialize and walk through walls, and enough skewed gender politics and sexual antics to give the book an X rating :-)), some of his most interesting characters (several of them new, and many old, such as Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw), and probably the most well developed presentation of the concept of The World As Myth. Heinlein uses this idea to tie together the different books, such as Glory Road, Stranger in a Strange Land, and The Number of the Beast, that are not a part of his Future History Series, by making them all members of the multiple timeline universe, or multiverse theory, that was discovered by mathematician Dr. Jake Burroughs in The Number of the Beast. It's a brilliant concept that unifies Heinlein's entire oeuvre under one integrating theory of temporal reality."
books,,4.0,A very good retrofit strategy...,"While I don't believe that Elizabeth was totally the excellent strategizer, I do believe she was well advised and did her own thinking.  This book goes back and imposing upon historical events the decisions made by Elizabeth-I and how it would apply in business today.  There are certain parallels between a monarchy and corporation that do fit together and can be seen in examples.  The major portion of the book covers the image that Elizabeth set forth by taking on being the  image of the Mother Mary (Catholic church) to her subjects, thus, to make the people more accepting of the new Church of England as the religious seat of power, thus diffusing the Vatican's hold over the people. My only complaint, like others opinions, there were no mention of where things went wrong, only highlighting the good things.  This is a very good book still and I recommend it along with another book called Big Chief Elizabeth (which is more of the history of the new World and Elizabeth's funding of the voyages to capture more land)."

Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been ""petrified"" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale."
books,,5.0,They will break your heart,This book is a must for anyone who loves dogs.  The book is a permanent reminder of beautiful animals that are put to death everyday across the US.  The pictures in this book will move you to tears.  The stories of these beautiful animals will tear at your heart.  Well written but you can only wish the book was double it's size because it leaves you wanting to see and read more
books,,1.0,Huge Disappointment,"The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Responding to ""slow down ziglar""","This is a great book.  Most of the stuff that Tony Robbins teaches in his 300$ influence programs has the same exact tenants that Ziglar teaches.  Ziglar is the best teacher for success principles, period.  I have studied in depth brian tracy, anthony robbins, earl nightingale, jim rohn, and anyone else of note in this field.  Ziglar is the best all around.  Earl did start it all with lead the field and that may be the best condensed program out there BUT Zig is the best today.  Tony and Tracy are 5 star speakers also."

books,,5.0,i real life story!,"Once again a great book from Nicholas Sparks, i've read them all, and Nicholas is always true to what would happen in real life.  He doesn't write about ""fairytales"" its all true to what happens in real life.  This was a moving story of what true love is, and allowing another to be happy.  He gave a small window into what it must be like for those serving our country overseas and didn't make it a rosey story that makes the world look perfect.  Definitely a sad story but one that leaves you inspired to hope, that you could do the same for someone that you loved that much.  If you are looking for the fairytale ending, this book isn't for you, but if you want a story that you could actually see happening its amazing.  I look forward to his next book"

books,12 of 12,5.0,"Wise, compassionate look at consciousness &amp; healing","Larry Dossey is a prolofic writer and researcher on holistic healing, and in this book he assembles a number of articles and essays in support of a cohesive concept.  Dossey invites the reader to explore the power of consciousness for healing transformation.  The different sections in the book sometimes refer to scientific theories and research, some of which would usually be considered in the realm of parapsychology, such as remote influencing, healing with prayer, non-local telepathic communication, etc.  However, the focus is more on how these concepts can be applied in our lives to bring about healing.  Dossey helps us peer beyond the veil of illusion we call &quot;reality&quot; to help us connect with the source of our being and the power of mind/consciousness to transform.  Having practiced mind-body/enegy medicine approaches such as hypnosis, reiki, and neuromodulation technique, I have experienced the power of the non-local consciousness to create healing shifts in a manner that would appear magical or unbelievable to those convinced of the solid, objective nature of perceived reality.  It is much easier to &quot;bend spoons&quot; when one lets go of the illusion that there is any objective spoon in the first place!  Enjoy this book and begin to put into practice the ideas and methods that unlock the power of consciousness"
books,,2.0,Disappointing,"I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, ""so and so was a devoted mother"" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading."

books,3 of 4,5.0,Horrifically Good,"You know you're in good hands when you open this book.  But it takes more than just an incredible set of credentials (Bram Stoker Award, several novels and over 15 anthology appearances) to be an effective teacher.  It  takes a broad understanding of the writing craft and business, and an  organized approach--all of which Van Belkom has with this book.  It's a  fast (216 pages), informative primer for new horror writers, and perhaps a  nice refresher for the pros.  Covering all the topics a book like this  should, such as composition, marketing, and the current state of the genre,  Van Belkom is at his best when he dissects his own stories and experiences  for the reader's benefit; I'm just disappointed he didn't give us  more--more meat, as they say.  If you're still in the  I'm-embarrassed-I-love-horror stage, Writing Horror has a flexible, paper  cover that's perfect for folding over when you're on a crowded subway"
books,29 of 30,5.0,A Compelling and Fascinating Read.,"Evan Thomas presents an outstanding, extraordinarily researched, and easy to read narrative of one of the Pacific's greatest sea battles in `Sea of Thunder: Four Commanders and the Last Great Naval Campaign 1941-1945'.  Uniquely, and most interesting is the balanced research it is clear Thomas completed in order to share a vivid picture of the mind-set of the combatants at sear: The U.S. Navy appeared to have a view that the Japanese Navy was not up to their combat ready level, and the Japanese Navy viewed the U.S. Navy as being made of individuals not willing to sacrifice for their beliefs. Obviously both perspectives were wrong; Thomas gives understanding of actions based upon these perspectives in a manner never told before."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Beyond Human Endurance,"Shipwrecked and held captive by Muslim slavers, this true story is so well written and researched and the story so unbelieveable it is difficult to put down. I have deliberately not read the ending because I don't want the experience to end.  With every step that these brave souls take through the unforgiving desert and the treatment they receive, because they are Christians and therefore ""dog dung"" is beyond human endurance. Their story of survival and their belief in their salvation is the best book I have ever read of this genre.  I am grateful to the author for giving me this life altering experience"
books,5 of 5,5.0,5 stars is not enough....,"As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse I found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person.  This book will stick with me a long time and I hope even though it is long, readers will give it the chance it deserves. I thought this work by Mr. Iles to be very insightful."

books,8 of 8,4.0,Interesting journey into the depths of stupidity,"If you've ever wondered how pyramid schemes get started and how they unravel, this book makes an interesting read.  You will be both amazed and appalled at the mass stupidity involved in getting these schemes off the ground.  However, you might feel a little foolish yourself when the author points out that our very own Social Security System is a textbook Ponzi scheme"

This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts"

books,,4.0,Classical Music Guide,This is an extremely comprehensive guide to classical music by over 500 composers and provides authoritative recommendations on the various performances of their works that are available on record. For each composer there is detailed information about their life and a critical analysis of their work. So this is both a biographical dictionary and a guide to recorded music. The articles are well written in an accessible style and the book is attractively produced. Highly recommended for the classical music lover

books,3 of 7,5.0,Works at many levels,This personal account of Pascal Khoo Thwe's life works for me on many levels. I feel as if I understand what it is like to belong to a culture so different from my own. His writing was deeply moving and so descriptive that I do believe I can feel and experience how his culture lived.
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Fast paced, touching...","Danielle Steele is a writer who wields the written word like an artist... using story lines that attract you by their sheer difference from what people experience in their own ""tame"" lives. Widowhood, single parenting, trauma, and grudging admiration make this story compelling...a tear jerker.... I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the talent of a successful story teller"
books,2 of 3,5.0,"Great, Baby, Great!","Left alone in a squalid Boston apartment by her neglectful mother, four year old Amanda MacCready is kidnapped, creating an instant media sensation. Impatient with the police, Amanda's aunt and uncle plead with ex-cops Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro to join the investigation. Acting against their instincts, the lovers reluctantly accept the case. The search for Amanda takes a heavy toll on all involved, especially the private detectives -- they uncover a dark conspiracy that drains them physically, mentally and emotionally, causing them to question their beliefs and ideals. Normally sharing the same world view, the duo find themselves in opposition when confronted with a morally ambiguous situation at the end of the novel. The decisions they make at that crucial moment have a profound impact on their self images and on their future together."
books,12 of 12,5.0,The Ultimate Eco-Warrior,"I was deeply affected by The Tracker -- after reading it, when I went to look at the stars in the winter, the cold didn't bother me as much.  I didn't expect this to be better, but it most definitely is.  If you've ever  struggled with why humans exist on this planet when we're so capable of  destroying it, you should get this book immediately and read the chapter  entitled &quot;The Tree Speaks&quot;.  There are many other gems of native  wisdom in here as well"
books,3 of 3,4.0,They're Not Just Playing Computer Games,"Next: The Future Just Happened is about how the internet is changing the world. Lewis profiles Jonathan Lebed, a teenage stock market wizard (the SEC says he was a stock market manipulator -- Lewis isn't so sure); a teenage law expert who has never studied law; a teenager in England who is using Gnutella software as a springboard to, I don't know, take over the world, I guess."
books,4 of 5,2.0,Nothing new,"I have been a trainer for many years, and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist - and I can tell you that Paul Owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training. This book is an average (at best) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other (professional) dog trainers/behaviorists. I've read many, many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing. If you're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do - check out any of Stanley Coren's books (he has many). If you're looking for training techniques - take a class. Honestly, there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes (with a respectable and knowledgable trainer) where they can be properly socialized and trained. If your dog is having serious behavior issues - consult a professional animal behaviorist. Your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody. Good luck!"
books,2 of 3,5.0,More Like 100 out of 5!,"This was my very first book for Nora Roberts, and so far it's the best book EVER.  It is THE PERFECT book.  Brianna is a wonderful, smart inn keeper with many talents and a rare kind of maturity.  I would love to be like her!  And Gray is a successful, sweet, caring, witty author that comes to her inn in Ireland to relax and start a new book.  This is no ordinary romance.  I love that it goes deep, not only into the main characters' personalities, but there is also Brianna's sister and brother-in-law, her mother, her friend, and Gray's agent.  Not to mention the wonderful scenary of Ireland described throughout the book.  The conlcusion of the book is wonderful and utterly satisfying, leaving you with a happy glow that lasts a long time!  Other books by Nora Roberts are good, but this one takes the prize.  Of the Born trilogy this one is the best and it should NOT be missed"
books,,2.0,Get to the point,"There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts."
books,9 of 11,5.0,Windbags Who Say This Book is Evil are Big Bozos,"I'm writing to refute a long, angry review I just read of this book. The reviewer points out the evil of following these laws, and is angry that the book advocates them. The book does not advocate these laws, it teaches them. It's a history lesson. It's not Greene's fault that these laws have been effectively put into effect for centuries by powerful people. The book is an analysis of human behavior and social relations, not a book on ethics. If it makes you angry, then it means you are literal-minded, anti-history, live in a dream world, and are completely wrapped up in yourself.  This book teaches you to be attentive to the social atmosphere that you  live in. If you can't do that, then you are anti-social, anti-powerful, anti-seductive, anti-intellectual, and a big  BOZO"
books,1 of 1,4.0,The book is amazing,"Dogs are my passion, in this wonderfully written book I've found that I am in GREAT company. It was well written, some of the stories could have been shorter. But it made me laugh and cry, and after almost every chapter I was amazed at what I didn't know about the people in the chapter. The research was extensive for this book. So if you love dogs and you love history you will really love this book"
books,1 of 2,5.0,A Federal State of Iraq,"Peter Galbraith offers his own professional diplomatic experience as insight into a way out of the quagmire of Iraq.  He has been there, mainly in the Kurdish region to the north, and has spoken with and dealt with Kurd leaders.  The Kurds suffered terribly under Saddam Hussein, but they also seem to have the vision of a cohesive way forward.  Break Iraq into separate federal regions, share the oil, and forget about a strong central government in Baghdad.  Not a solution much shared by the U.S. government, but then, the Bush administration paid no attention to the different histories and cultures of the Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis (not to mention other minorities) of Iraq before they invaded in March 2003.  At this distance in time, in November 2006, it's pretty obvious that a unified Iraq in the same mold as before the war is now out of the question.  It could be too late for anything but more chaos, but we should listen to the Kurds, as Galbraith suggests.  It could be the only way out for us, and for the Iraqis"

books,39 of 40,5.0,You kill. You die....having safety behind bars is as simple as that,"Safety Beind Bars is the third collected volume of Robert Kirikman's excellent The Walking Dead comic book series from Image Comics. This volume collects issues 13 through 18 and it continues that journey and travails of surviving in a world overrun by the undead. As the tagline of the books proclaim, in a world ruled by the dead we are forced to finally start living. This is so true in Safety Behind Bars as Kirkman and returning artist Charlie Adlard tell the story of Rick Grimes and his band of survivors as they come across what they think will be their salvation from the threat of the hungry dead: an abandoned prison complex."

I will tell you that these are recipes that for the most part include ingredients that any southern cook will find on hand at any time. Simple, easy, and very tasty recipes that your family will love. If some appear to have a high fat content and that bothers you then use your brain and take measures accordingly. It really is that easy."
books,5 of 5,5.0,An Impressive Book,"Freedom From Fear is an exhaustive study of America and its people during two of this country's most defining periods, the Great Depression and World War II. David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book."
books,10 of 10,5.0,Absolutely Great,"This book should be mandatory for anyone even thinking of getting a dog.  Even if that dog is ten years off.  Since I became interested in dogs and dog welfare, I have heard and seen too many times the unhappy scenario of dogs being dumped because their owners just did not bother to do ANY reasearch.  Families duped by Beethoven, Lassie, and 101 Dalmations decide tv never lies and buy one for their young children.  People who want a guard dog buy a Rottweiler for ""protection"" and dump it out in the yard.  A calm couple wants a ""small, quiet, easy-going dog"", so they judge on size and get a terrier.  A jogger wants a partner and thinks a great dane will keep up."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Great source for managers,"This is one of those few books that is simple yet not simplistic. Book is written for corporate managers whose job responsibility is outside the decipline of finance, however who can benefit from knowing the finance at the fundamental level. Book does not go into ""mechanics"" of finance and focuses more on the ""essense"" of finance. Written with the simplicity of small business yet with questions to be asked in large corporations. I would strongly recommend this book to all my managers."

I know realistically that outcomes vary, but as a mom, it is therapeutic to hear an uplifting experience like the author's"
books,2 of 2,5.0,"Travels With Charlie, by John Steinbeck","Favorite memories of this book come from years ago when I could not put the book down as I read of Steinbecks travels with his poodle.  For those whose minds wander and wonder about the roads, towns and people of the U.S., I highly recommend this book.  I am purchasing it to read again"
books,11 of 11,5.0,An Authoratative Guide,"The idiomatic use of the English language needs a referee, and some referees are simply better than others. The &quot;anything goes&quot; motto of our times gives us uneven, illiterate, and occasionally brutal prose. This book helps block this inevitable slide into the lack of clarity and coherence. This second edition (cf., Third Edition) of &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; may strike some readers as arcane and archaic, because it is so restrictive in its prescriptions. Given the laxity of many our writers, the use of a strict disciplinarian in philology is a welcome resource"
books,27 of 145,1.0,The Islamo-Fascists Murderers thank Professor Chomsky!,"Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the ""underdog,"" even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah."

books,,2.0,A disappointment,"Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one.  The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told.  Phrases, such as ""back in the day,"" get repeated much too often.  Reacher has become a caricature of himself"
books,6 of 7,5.0,The power of thought,"The title of this book is actually quite deceiving, because even though the author focuses on the link between thought and financial success, his principals can be utilized in all areas of life. I have studied the ancient texts of the Vedas and Upanishads and have found a strong link between the work of Napoleon Hill and this ancient philosophy on the power of thought."
books,7 of 10,1.0,Swindled,"I think I know how this book was written.  A whole lot of cut and paste from U.S. Law code with some mediocre story telling sprinkled in.  If you want to be technical and write in the language of professional law, fine.  But this is not the series to do it in."
books,5 of 6,5.0,Powerful and redemptive,"I read Stephen's book late into the night and then got up and read more in the morning. The book not only brought me new understanding of the world of blindness, it spoke intimately of the journey of self-acceptance. Stephen's story is threaded through with grace, and his language is musical. A deeply spiritual memoir; you will finish it changed"

books,58 of 67,5.0,This book does more than just inform,"Thank you once again to Lynne Cheney for caring enough to write a book for all of us who need to appreciate the history of our country more than we do. This book does more than just inform, it invites the average American to delight in the events that have contributed to the forming of our great America. I am proud to be an American and have watched friends and family make sacrifices for the freedom of all, but I remain one of the typical victims of the history snobs (otherwise known as history professors and experts) who cared more about impressing students with their high intellect than instilling a love for the history of our country in their students.  Even at my age, after reading this book I am motivated to read more about some of the historical events presented in Mrs. Cheney's enlightening timeline. I am encouraged that a book like this can be given to young people and we can expect that their interest in historical events will be piqued.  I plan to give this book to many people (young and old) as a gift to them and to all of us who want to see the pride and love of American history returned to its people! I highly recommend this book"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Perhaps the finest overview of Charles Ponzi!,"To understand the Ponzi scheme, is to understand the basic root of all types of [cheating].  This book gives a wonderful overview of the life and times of Charles Ponzi.  It is written as a historical novel, but seems to be very well researched!  The epilogue alone is full of details concerning an important subject about whom little has been written.  I only wish the book was footnoted as to references.  Donald Dunn has done history a great service by documenting the life of Mr. Ponzi.  THIS BOOK IS A ""FUN READ"" ABOUT A SERIOUS HISTORICAL EVENT"
books,9 of 12,5.0,A primer on development,"DeSoto is a genuinely original thinker.  This was his first book that argued that regulation in &quot;developing&quot; countries impedes economic development.  His most memorable example is one of a small entrepreneur who wants to open a hot dog stand in Peru - with six months of working with government entities - they could get a permit.  No wonder why some people choose to work in the grey economy.   DeSoto looks at a number of areas where regulation slows down the natural tendency of individuals to be entrepreneurial.   The Mystery of Capital - which is his second book - has new data and amplification of his original premise.  But this one, which has been translated into many languages and should be used as a guide"
books,,4.0,"Romance, Parties, Celebrities, Fashion, Best Friends, and Caring Family.  Were you looking for anything else?","I never read TDWP, or any romance novel for that matter, but thought I might get a glimpse into the romantic expectations of women as revealed in a modern chick lit book.  This is a lighthearted, happy-ending tale not meant to rival the collective works of Dickens and any attempt to critique it as otherwise is really silly."

I am a yoga teacher whose classes are filled with women who begin yoga at a time when they are experiencing the symptoms of menopause. I keep this book in plain view and tell my students that one of the most empowering things they can do for themselves is to be familiar with the information in this book. To me, Christiane Northrup is the Goddess of Menopause, giving all us women in transition a Wake-Up Call! She reminds us that, ""At midlife our job is to learn how to take care of ourselves instead of everybody else. If we don't learn how to do this, we soon learn that no one will do this for us."" Thank you, Dr. Northrup, for helping us celebrate this liberating, crowning, glorious stage of life!"

Oh my goodness I think I will write a poofty Wicca book! I think I could absolutely do it!... Seriously though students and seekers and those experienced in magickal systems, paganisim, wicca or what ever my advice is: Run away just run away...unless of course you desire a good chuckle...."
books,,5.0,great book if you are in search of yourself,"I was assigned to read this book for a class called Psychology: Intro to Counseling, Theory and Practice. The book talks about Frankl and his meaning for his life, how and what he found meaning in while in the concentration camps. It is an existentialist writing about his experiences. He grew, he learned, he made choices, and lived life for himself, even under the guise of imprisonment. The fact that any one man can find meaning in all of this is amazing. I really wish I had the chance to meet Krankl and speak with him. It is a powerful story and a great theory. Logotherapy is worth of even the most devoted Freud Fan."
books,9 of 9,4.0,Nice Collection,"The Watcher and Other Stories is a collection of three different but thematically interlinked stories.  I personally thought that the title story was the most intriguing.  The Watcher deals with our protagonist ""watching"" the voting procedures in a home for invalids/deranged/etc.  The home is a mini city and becomes a type of microcosm of Italian society.  Smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution.  The Argentine Ants is a type of mock horror story.  All of the above are extremely well written and executed.  Although I did enjoy this book, I would suggest that readers unfamiliar with Calvino try some of his masterpieces first, and then move onto the minutiae of works such as these."
books,17 of 19,5.0,Highly Recomended,"In this book, Schaeffer illustrates that the reason the world is in such disarray is because we no longer have a moral and ethical foundation to build upon.  This book explores the paramount philosophic, religious, and scientific ideas from the decline of Rome until the 1960s.  He claims that in order to understand where we are today we must trace these three lines in history.  He begins with the decline of Rome (with its amalgamation of Greek values) and proceed through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Romanticism, Industrialism, Modernity, and the post-modern world.  Not only does Schaeffer explore the history of Western philosophy, religion, and science, but also history art, culture, cinema, Christianity, humanism, and communism. Furthermore, there is a flow to history that is rooted in people's thoughts.  Their thought-world determines how they act.  The results of this thought-world (or world view) impact the external world.  Schaeffer points out that individual people throughout the establishment of Western culture impacted the external world with their lives.  These impacts led to the present culture that we live in now.  Many of these individuals shaped our culture to reject a Biblical foundation with absolute morals and ethics to live by.  Instead of this moral foundation, the West is now functioning on top of a feeble, relative foundation.  Schaeffer asserts that this is the reason our culture is in its current hysteria.  He basically divides man and his view on the world into the two categories of belief in an infinite God (Christianity) and belief in the absence of an infinite deity (humanism).  The book provides evidence proving that the Christian belief promotes a solid basis for morals, ethics, and order; however, humanism promotes relativism and chaos.  It is on this basis that Schaeffer proves that without Christian principles, a culture is doomed to failure.  He points out that Christianity gives meaning and beauty to all individual and corporate life.  Anything Short of it brings death to every aspect of life.  Because of this, Schaeffer is not hesitant to point out that the cure for society rests in Christianity alone.  This book was written so that we would ""turn from the greatest of wickedness, the placing of any created thing in the place of the creator, and that this generation may get its feet out of the paths of death and may live."""
books,14 of 14,5.0,Atheism At Its Best,"Natural Atheism covers almost every aspect of atheism in a compendious and lucid manner. The chapters of the book are presented in a logical order and address a variety of issues such as what exactly is atheism and why it is the logical conclusion of the critically thinking person, so-called different types of atheism, agnosticism, the relationship between science and religion, an atheistic spirituality, and the complex history of separation between church and state. The author doesn't delve as deeply as possible into the variety of philosophical and scientific reasoning's that might point to the existence of a  Creator, but then again, he doesn't have to. There are other books on the market dedicated to discussing these issues from an atheistic perspective. The objective that Natural Atheism focuses on is  the conclusion that atheism is the conclusion of the rational individual and the book does this extremely well.  Eller uses his erudition to demolish a panoply of reasons that a theist might have for believing in a god ( or more accurately, gods) . An atheist will find that this book reaffirms their reasons for becoming (or staying) an atheist in the first place. The theist will have their opinions, beliefs, and conclusions thoroughly challenged. This is not a book that attempts to turn a theist into an atheist by denigrating religion; the author shows how religion, every religion, practically begs the believer to question its veracity by simply studying the very idea of religion objectively. This book should be read by theists and atheists alike."

books,2 of 4,4.0,More passion than any straight love story I've read in a while,"If I could've given this book 4 and 1/2 stars I would because I read it straight through in about 2 days.  I thought it was really good, and although things didnt work out in the end, as my review title states, clay and sam have more passion between them than any 2 straight characters have had in a long time.  While theres alot of talk about punk rock and not much to be seen, I can bare with it.  When I was 1st starting to like punk, Rancid and NOFX were the 2 most punk bands I could think of, minding the Ramones and maybe the Clash.  Sam's narration is likeable, you don't really get bored with this book, and it moves along at a good pace.  Plus, the backdrop of Hawaii was a really great place to set a love story so chaotic.  Good stuff"

books,3 of 5,5.0,READ THIS BOOK!,"""Clay's Way"" is an adventurous tale about a sixteen year old boy who falls in love with an unattainable boy one year his senior. Set in Hawaii, this book has great character development, excellent setting descriptions, and a couple of gnarly plot twists that kept me page turning long past my bedtime. Though the storyline falters a tiny bit towards the middle, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an honest depiction of those angry and often confusing teenage years. You don't need to be gay to appreciate the messages in this story:"

books,9 of 11,5.0,Fascinating study of an enigma,"The subject of the book is hard to understand, even with all the facts laid out so admirably.  Kessler's writing style commands attention without getting in the way of the facts, but those facts are so twisting that at times even the most diligent student of history may be confused.  That's a small quible, however, in an overarching work of vigor and suspense.  Well worth a read"

The multinationals, who benefit from massive subsidies (aeronautics, computers, metallurgy, you name it) are more than happy to have members of the bought priesthood of academia distill  fantasies about the joys of the alleged &quot;free market.&quot;  Not a  word in this book about the public subsidies that become private profits,  with a huge military and growing prison-industrial-complex for the millions  of people who are superfluous to the plans being made (undemocratically, of  course) in Geneva and Bonn.  Corporate tyranny and its servants are  destroying the environment, labor protections, the public sphere, and  cultural diversity.  Goebbels would be impressed"

books,1 of 1,5.0,The Greatest General - in his own words,"This used to be the manual for every young noble going to war as an officer. Today it is a historical document showing the roman republic in war, and in particular a portrait of how the great Ceasar would like his friends, enemies and history to see him. This book has shaped the thinking of allmost every military commander for 2000 years, and it would be a shame not to read the words penned by the dictator himself."
books,3 of 4,5.0,McCullough's Best?,"I must say as a fan of history and American politics I have enjoyed all of McCullough's books that I've read to date and ""Truman"" is easily one of his masterpieces.  However, I think McCullough fails to inform his reader of some important details while portraying the life of Harry S. Truman.  For example, McCullough portrays Truman as a heroic visionary acting courageously to prevent the spread of communism into South Korea but fails to mention that the ""democracy"" Truman was protecting was a military dictatorship.  Other than that, this book is a great read about a great man and admittedly McCullough's ""oversights"" are innocuous to the finished product."

An invaluable tool for those approaching Postcolonialism, Culture and Imperialism is quite possibly the most illuminating piece of writing I have considered. A fine text, and one of immeasurable usefulness"

books,1 of 2,2.0,I must have missed something,"I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character."
books,12 of 15,5.0,A simple and direct introduction to free market economics,"This book is usually listed by free-market advocates as one of the five books to read first.  Henry Hazlitt writes with unequaled clarity.  He outlines that basics of many fundamental ideas--the price system, inflation, government subsidies, minimum wage, and others.  He uses pure logic and reasoning almost exclusively, only providing statistics as sidenotes to the main point.  However, the book's strength is also its weakness.  While he makes a tremendous intellectual defense of free market economics, it by no means complete.  I would recommend this to any beginning libertarian or free market advocate; it will provide many strong points for further contemplation and research.  However, a Keynesian advocate will still be able to question certain ideas.  Yet, any intellectually honest statist should read it, because Hazlitt does present his arguments cogently, clearly, and with power.  One note: a more seasoned free market economist may wish to consider this book a medium priority, because it may be somewhat basic to someone familiar with classic arguments"
books,1 of 6,2.0,A disappointment,"I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. ""A History of Civilizations"" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book."
books,3 of 3,5.0,The Best Play of the 20th Century,"Samuel Beckett's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them.

For myself, I thought 'Prayers' dialogue was a bit snappier, more colorful, than the others but that's me. One of the many things I enjoy about Lehane's writing is that he puts as much effort into the last ten pages as he did the first ten. In detective and mystery stories, that's rare indeed"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent,"I join the chorus of admirers of this wonderful history of the events leading up to and including the great battle.  The crossing was indeed a pivotal, crucial moment in American history.  It is no stretch of the truth to enumerate this as one of the 10 most important moments in our entire history.  Although Washington deserves the credit for his extraordinary skill, nerve, and leadership, Fischer's re-telling is an amazing feat of fascinating, page-turning detail about the ordinary soldiers who overcame enormous obstacles to get to Trenton, much less to triumph over the shocked Hessians, and their valiant leader, who bravely succumbed to mortal injury.  We cross the treacherous Delaware with the intrepid Americans, trek with them across the snows, hurrah with their surprise attack, and follow them on to further victory.  Historian or lay person, this is a book you must read to learn of this ""little skirmish"" that eventually made America a world power.  Fischer has done a masterful job.  We come away just that much prouder to be descendants of these at once ordinary and extraordinary Americans"
books,3 of 6,5.0,An intriguing world,"The author weaves a complex tapestry with this novel. There are depths of this world that make me want to dig deeper. The nature of the magic, and its hold on people ... don't ask! ... it wouldn't be wise.  Her characters have a depth of texture. Prince Rhys - not your typical aggressive swash buckling hero - for reasons painful to consider - is drawn inexorably to fight to regain the family crown if not the family jewels. Surrounded by a rich suite of other characters - princesses, dukes, wizards and the lower echelons of society as well - pursuing their own agendas in shades of grey that provides a credibility often lost in fantasy. Not a children's book -  a darker story path, with more twists and more reward, for this reader at least."

The eager repetition of ""The Supremem Court interpreted the 14th Amendment to give civil rights to Corporations"" as the SINGLE WORST argument to ever come forth from that body was one of the funniest lietmotif's in this hysterical parody of US History told from the standpoint of an over-the-top Marxist.

To address some of the critics mentioned in the other reviews: RE: ""Dewey Dogma"" (1) There is absolutely no pretense of an application of the scientific method, hence there can be no mis-application; (2) This book strikes me personally as one of the least dogmatic things I've ever read in my life.  The ideas are fresh, original, and beautiful crafted and ordered; (3) ""Education is Socialization"" - an equation of broadly construed ""-tions"" that results in a statement that one can neither agree nor disagree with."

Let Earth and it's biolgical processes teach and guide us to a rational, sustainable, regenerative, healthy existence."
books,15 of 16,4.0,Sad but True,"This book was referenced in a text that I read regarding teen sexuality, and since the reference sounded interesting I found a copy of it.  Brumberg discusses here what she calls the ""body projects"" of teenage and adult women and how these projects have changed over time.  By ""body projects"" she means what women are focused on changing about themselves at a particular place in history, whether it be the face, the body, or their sexuality.  In describing these particular projects the author goes into detail about the history of menarche and menstruation, acne, and the hymen while also discussing the history of the social aspects of virginity and how female sexuality was (and is) perceived and discussed within a family and society."
books,9 of 10,5.0,Great book for anyone considering the profession.,"I like how it gives good information and advice for someone like myself who was considering the profession.  It gave me an excellent idea of what to expect of the profession.  I just wish I had listened even more carefully to his advice when reading the book, especially the advice about taking some time off between highschool and going to school to be an architect.  One thing future architects need to realize is that if you are an architecture major, you will have no free time whatsoever outside of your classroom studio.  So if you have any wild and crazy side to you that just wants to party, I suggest getting that out of your system first and then go study architecture.  If there is any traveling you really want to do, do it first.  Cause architects work hard and on average dont even make that much money.  Anyhow this book contains other useful information for those who are certain they want to be architects as well.  It gives you an excellent idea of what to expect, the types of jobs you will be doing, the skills you will need, ect."

books,2 of 4,5.0,Synthesis at its best,"Many of the Amazon reviewers of Polk's book are guilty of being ""political"", a charge that they attempt to tar Polk with.  So when you read the reviews keep in mind that Bush apologists can be found everywhere and people of that sort  know only too well that should Polk's reasonable and insightful book become popular their cause will be hurt.  Polk's main contribution is that he has synthesised a highly complex story and made it concise and accessible for the average American.  For those of us who have worked with US policy abroad, the simple points Polk makes about Iraq are painful, but true.  Bush and his Iraq team would fail Economic Development 101 as taught by any university in America.  As Polk recounts, there can be no political or economic improvement without good communication (an occupation army and administration with virtually no Arabic language skills is absolutely unthinkable, yet that is the situation we have); in the long-run, top down development absolutely never works (how could Bremer not understand this?); local support is a prerequisite for all successful development (democratic, capitalist development models are unreal ideas to the average Iraqi); and without stable and secure populations and institutions, development plans, capitalist or otherwise, will not be worth the paper they are printed on.  Polk focuses on these basic ideas and presents his case on how and why the United States has ended up in a pickle of Bush and Chaney's choosing.  So unlike the others to be found here, if you must read a book on Iraq, pick ""Understanding Iraq"".  It is history written from a point of view that strives for simple, telling, damning truth; the one thing that political types of all stripes abhor."
books,23 of 24,5.0,Excellent Resource and Recipes,"I am a cookbook lover.  I love to read cookbooks, and this book is great for that.  It is filled with tips from Cook's test kitchen about the best way to do things.  But I also like to cook and to be able to make things that my husband and children will eat.  This book has given me enjoyment on both of these levels.  I have made many of the recipes and have not been disappointed and plan to make many more.  The mac-n-cheese recipe is excellent, the lasagna great, and I recently served the potato, bacon and egg casserole to rave results.  In fact, my mouth is watering just thinking of how that smelled while it was cooking."

books,1 of 1,4.0,The Tragicomedy,"Waiting for Godot was dubbed a ""tragicomedy"" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play.  The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work.  However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you.  Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be.  Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own.  What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality.  Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous.  Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale.  Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold.  A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor"
books,8 of 18,2.0,Three Years Later...,"It took me 3 years to read this book - should I end the review now? It's not because I am an extremely busy person, or because the book was so enormous that I read it endlessly for that long. No, the reason it took me 3 years to read this book is because it's just not very good. As excellent as Lies My Teacher Told Me was, this was equally bad."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great,"I really enjoyed packing volume three with me on a recent vacation trip.  Feynman amazes me with his clarity of thought, clear explanations, and wonderful sense of humor.  Why should there be anything difficult about the fundamentals of nature?  You really see how simple things are at the bottom, and only get clouded when working out the details.  Feynman clearly separates the essence from the messy mathematical details of implementation.  I love how he beats a horse to death in one dimension before generalizing!  I'm sure that's how all great minds work.  Few books on quantum mechanics are of such a high caliber.  Volume three is a treasure"

books,1 of 1,5.0,A must read,"This book holds alot of great information on how to protect yourself, it can even make you paranoid, about who has all your info!  It is also a great story in itself.  A must read with the book Catch Me If You Can"

books,,4.0,"Good introduction to corporate raiding, but starting to feel a little dated","There are plenty of good summaries of this book here, so I'll briefly make one point:  this book is a good read, but the business climate has changed dramatically since it was written, and many of the characters here are retired or have moved to very different investing styles.  So the book is worth reading, but I'm not convinced it is as timely as say Lowenstein's books on the Internet bubble or Hedge Funds, or any of the many Enron books out now"
books,2 of 2,4.0,A Personal Journey,"The Pulitzer Prize winning ""Gilead"" is an extremely personal book--an aging Congregationalist minister tells his story through his diary entries--meant to be read by his 7-year old son in about 15 years (long after his ill father's death).  The historical background harks back to the days of John Brown, the radical abolitionist preacher.  The ""current"" day is rural Iowa (Gilead of the title) in the `50s.  I struggled with some of the theological discussion (although Congregationalists are cousins to Unitarians), but Rev. Ames story of personal discovery kept me going.  There is a great story about a town in Kansas that you'll long remember"

books,,5.0,You should have this book,"A friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right. It is one of the most underrated books out there. It's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old. The real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives. One of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity. Buy it, read it and pass along to your friends and family."
books,3 of 3,5.0,A manager's opinion,"I have been a manager for over 10 years, and have worked in different industries and different countries.  And I gladly admit I still have a lot to learn concerning management.  This book talks about concepts we know we should all be applying, such as learning from mistakes, responsibility and organization, attention to details as well as to a master plan, communication, etc.  However understanding how Churchill put these concepts to work is fascinating.  I did not know that much about Churchill in the first place, perhaps that is why I enjoyed the book so much.  It is a nice change from CEOs' biographies.  And yes, I am putting some of what I read to work, so it was worth my time and money"

There are so many facts about things you never thought about but will now question why you hadn't before. Unfortunately, now I can't make it through the day without thinking about something relating to the book. Seriously though, this book can be enjoyed by everyone through all walks of life. Fantastic gift idea"

books,2 of 2,4.0,Grisham's Best,"""A Time to Kill"" is definitely Grisham's best novel.  It's interesting that it was Grusham's first novel, but it was rejected for publication until after some of his other novels were published.  The story deals with a number of issues that all intertwine seamlessly.  Racism, murder, justice, revenge, law and order, etc.  The story will hold you from start to finish.  Most of Grisham's newer novels are simple, predictable stories that bash attorneys.  That is not the case with ""A Time to Kill"".  It will grip you, tear you and entertain you all at the same time"

Marie Gesto's 1996 disappearance, a case to which Bosch was assigned when he was in Homicide, was never solved. Her clothes were found neatly folded on the front seat of an abandoned car parked in the garage of a vacant luxury apartment but her body was never recovered and the case has eaten at Bosch ever since. Thirteen years later, Raynard Waits was pulled over in his van in the early morning hours in Echo Park but the traffic stop turned out to be far from routine. The officers discovered two trash bags in the van that contained the dismembered body parts of two women. In an effort to avoid the death penalty, Waits and his lawyer, Maurice Swann, negotiate a deal with the prosecuting attorney, Rick O'Shea, in which Waits confesses to nine murders including Marie Gesto's and promises to lead the police to the location of her long buried body."

The book unfolds much as a solving a mathematical problem would.  Uncle Petros emerges as a tragic figure, victim of classical hubris but earning our sympathy.   An excellent read by a talented writer"
books,8 of 9,5.0,Great Fun and Good Learning Tool,"I used this book in preparation for a trip to Italy last Spring and I found it very helpful. At first I wasn't expecting much from a work book, but they do a very good job at helping you understand the relationships between words, places, and things. I found it a good compliment to also listening to audio learning guides such as Pimsleur or Michel Thomas (you can borrow these from your local library!). I definitely used this book for more than 10 minutes at a time"

I play Santa Claus for enjoyment and the response I received this year was unbeivable from young to old.  Each page would come to life before the audience I would read too.  The breath taking response was overwheling to me.  This book is in a catagory of it's own!  The joy of those who encountered this book every time I would read it, made it worth while EVERY time.  If you buy it, you will NOT be disapointed"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Full Circle Impact!,"I loved this Amy Tan book, it's an easy read and will have you drawn in right away to the story.  This series written by Amy Tan is easily digestable and enjoyable to read, sometimes it's hard for me to engage a book but the books written by Amy Tan are so colorful and descriptive, it just draws me in and I can't stop reading.  This series is probably the best of it's series, diasecting the mother daughter relationship on such a delicate and complicated subject, a Chinese mother and an American born daughter who unknowingly lets the opportunity escape her to truly understand the intents and passions of her mother.  Bridged by communication gaps and difference in language styles and a mother who might be troubled with dimentia, this mother-daughter journey is plagued with mishaps and turmoil.  When June, the daughter, accepts new reason for her mother's off key personality, June offers too little too late and soon she has too many loose strings of her mother's past that she earlier dismissed as nonsense or retoric, to tie together to make sense.  June traces the pieces back to gain what her mother generously offered her in knowledge, but what becomes clear is the spirit of her mother lives inside of her as she comes to grips with who she is as a person and what her purpose in life is. I loved this book and have read almost the entire Amy Tan series. This book is the HINGE of all Amy Tan books, read this and you'll understand the others with new clarity!  LOVED IT!  WILL READ IT AGAIN!"

I would say this would be a great first investment book to read."

Use the PDF and search electronically for the information because the printed index is incredibly lacking."

In this wonderful book, he has shown what a REAL friend is, which is something that most of us can only aspire to"

books,17 of 17,5.0,"unusual subject and style, very well done","A murder mystery set in 1500s Istanbul, one of the most exotic cities in the world.  Each chapter is a first person narrative from a different character, the very first from the man who has just been killed, catching your attention immediately.  The murderer has 2 voices, one his real identity not revealed as the culprit, and one as the killer.  Dogs, trees, paintings and the devil all have a chapter or two as well making the story move along in a strong quick fascinating way, like going down a path of stepping stones towards the finish.  There is a love story, and a story of the forces of traditional Islamic art facing the beginning of an invasion of Western art ideals (the angst and reactions of the characters is insight into some aspects of the depth and manner of the religion of Islam).  This book is operating on many levels, all of them great.  A unusual style and a great multi-level story, as if the dense intricate beautiful tile-work of the Ottomans became literature.  Highest recommendations."
books,2 of 2,4.0,A Way to watch the development of a great writer,"This novel provides an interesting angle for fans of David Foster Wallace- a great book, but clearly the product of a fascinating and inventive writer who is still figuring out the true extent of his voice. Thus, while the book has many of the hallmarks of his writing (the ""must....describe....everything"" of his subsequent works), it also has a kind of- dare we say- brevity, that is refreshing and works in the book's favor. While it stops short of the brilliance that followed, this is still a wonderful book, full of amazing characters, amazing situations, and is just plain an amazing read"

books,0 of 1,2.0,Nothing special here,"I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning ""Killer Angels,"" and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there."

books,6 of 9,2.0,a long newspaper article....,"The author could have done much more with her subject.  Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character.  For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive.  At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet.  Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly?  Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual.  But the author never treats him as such."

books,7 of 9,5.0,Insightful but limited by one person reviews,"Third Ear competes indirectly with Penguin Guide in the field music criticism but is limited by having only one person review an entire composer or a selection of a composer's genre. So, unlike Penguin Guide, the reader only gets the opinion of a single person (along with now-deceased editor Alexander Morin) instead of the combined opinion of the three authors of Penguin Guide. Otherwise the book fares well against its more established competitor. Among Third Ear's greatest value -- it contains music often not found in Penguin Guide. It usually contains multiple listings of music deemed unsuitable for the British publication, such as Beethoven's &quot;Wellington's Victory&quot;. Another example is its review of the burgeoning recordings of Crusell's three Clarinet Concertos, where Third Ear offers a far more comprehensive view than even the 2003-04 edition of Penguin Guide. But there are serious drawbacks in this publication, too. For reasons that could never be explained, Third Ear dedicates less than two pages to the entire output of Anton Bruckner, whose nine symphonies have been recorded many times since middle 20th century. This is a criminal oversight that cannot be forgiven, especially since Third Ear dedicates almost a page to every one of Gustav Mahler's symphonies, the composer most akin to Bruckner. I should grade this book down an entire star for this hideous omission, but I won't since I've found it countless times to be an exciting and interesting volume. Most of the authors are known to veteran collectors and many are current or former contributors to American Record Guide, including the late, esteemed editor and Harold C. Schonberg, who wrote the foreward. Both the late Messrs. Morin and Schonberg were estimable critics who never sought to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse when discussing a record, CD or live performance. While the one reviewer to a section mandate of this book can be limiting -- not to mention the way it projects the the biases of a reviewer (see the comments on Roger Norrington's Beethoven symphonies; a critic calls one &quot;spew&quot;)-- it is not enough to deny the greatness and value of this book to record collectors. Third Ear joins the Penguin Guide, Rough Guide to Classical Music and now-deleted Insider's Guide to Classical Recordings by Jim Svejda to offer buyers information on the many choices available on Amazon.com and elsewhere in the wonderful world of classical music"

books,4 of 4,4.0,Review of Audio CD,"I'm writing this review of the 5-CD audiobook, not the book. The CD is a must-have, whether you've read the book or not. In it, actual examples are acted out of all kinds of conversations before and after the techniques are used. After listening to the CD I can easily recall what to do when I find myself suddenly in a difficult conversation, because i've actually heard it. Also, as you move through the sessions, the authors go just a bit deeper and deeper until one finds oneself admitting some very personal truths. I think the reviewer below who recommends Dale Carnegie instead didn't hear the CDs -- I didn't get the same result from Dale's books, as I have from listening to these CDs. The ultimate result of having listened to the series a few times? I don't get thrown off balance (their term) so often when I suddenly realize the other person is reacting negatively to what I thought was positive, and vice versa. I just switch into a different mode and many times, the person (either me or my companion) has forgotten they were upset at all."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Encouraging and Informative,"Keyes does a great job presenting the case for finding hope in the writing process. This book specifically discusses: dealing with anxiety, frustration and despair, overcoming the discouragers in your life, exorcising excuses for not writing and pursuing a career in writing, the rites of rejection, the nature of publishers and editors, and how to keep hope alive."

She just loved it so we bought both the Chicka Chicak Boom Boom and the 123 numbers books.  She loves these books!  They sell a set with magnetic numbers and I regret not buying that one, but we have other letters to use for additional book interaction.  Plus Blues Clues doesn't do the entire story, so it was fun to be able to read the rest of the book after the letters fall out of the tree.  I highly recommend this book for any child learning their ABC....it's fun for learning"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Detox Is More Than A Pill,"THE 7-DAY DETOX MIRACLE was written for those who know that a yearly detox is just one step on the road to wellness. Most doctors acknowledge that many illnesses have their origin in the gradual accumulation of junk and gunk in the liver, kidneys, and bloodstream. What authors Peter Bennett and Stephen Barrie have done was to write a text that is somewhere in the middle between a primer for the layman and a more advanced text for serious students of medicine and health. They devote the first seven chapters to a scholarly yet readable theoretical explanation as to what a detox is, what it is not, why we need one, and the various lab tests that allow you to optimize and individualize a detox program. The part of the book I found a needed warmup for the actual process itself was the authors description for a dedication for a week long task that may disrupt one's life style for that week. Essentially, they recommend that one ought to take a series of tests prior to the detox that range from chemistry screen testing to acid/base PH testing and to oxidative stress testing. Since these tests require the intervention of qualified health care professionals, it makes sense not to act precipitously without outside help. Once you know what shape your body is in relative to potential toxic excesses, then the program as outlined in this book not only makes sense but is seen as a necessary treatment either to eliminate these toxins or to make sure that you never get them."

I always do well in the philosophy classes, but there is one part I hate: the reading. I was convinced that there was no point in philosophy that one could not talk through with another person; the words and semantics in philosophy, meant to clarify arguments when spoken, simply seemed a muddle to me when read. So it was with trepidation that I picked up my latest assignment--Tolstoy's Confession. I read it, and was shocked to find myself completely engrossed. Here, finally, was what I'd been looking for...the On the Road of philosophy, the self-effacing Jack Kerouac of the field. Everyone who's had worries about the fleeting nature of life and everyone who's worried that it all means nothing, this is your book"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Another great installment in a wonderful series!,"One of the best things about Alexander McCall Smith's entertaining No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is that these aren't really traditional detective stories at all.  One must read between the lines to see that the amusing tales delve far deeper than solving simple mysteries and crimes. Each book provides an enchanting glimpse into the life and times of Botswana and the series really serves as a clever study of human nature.  The loveable and heavyset chief detective Mma Ramotswe is clearly large and in charge, as her unique agency helps its clients and the stories' readers themselves discover many ""things they already know."" This charming series is excellent light reading and especially great for planes. Take the whole series with you to make a transatlantic flight go by in the blink of an eye!"

Ms. Schaef addresses all forms of addiction, from chemical to behavioral, and sees within our society's gradual acceptance of its own corruptions the seven deadly sins of anger, covetousness, envy, gluttony, lust, pride and sloth.  Perpetuating our malaise we see in our leaders the aspects of control, dishonesty and dualism (seeing only two alternative solutions to any problem.)  It is shocking to face these at first, but once the truth of it dawns on the reader, he/she is led through the greatest assisting factors toward our collective &quot;recovery&quot;: Process (the ideas used in the 12-step programs); Sobriety (fastest route to clear thinking); and Spirituality (not necessarily the dogmatic sort that keeps us in the submissive, non-living, non-aware state!)  This book is not for the person too busy to have time to digest something wonderfully deep and enriching!  Reading it is like taking a shower in the purest, cleansing water, and emerging to absorb its message like rays of powerful sunshine!  It is empowering.  A fantastic door opening to the possibilities of our becoming a truly free and healthy society of thinking, alive, deprogrammed individuals!  Read this one before any of her other books!

It's even more amazing then how most companies have simply ignored the lessons illustrated within, only to continue on their dismal path of mediocrity. The basic lesson to be learned is that if your company religiously follows the core tenets outlined in the book, then your company will be the leader in your industry, because you will be the only company to do so. So why is this circa 1980's book still relevant? Because the principles apply just as much today, and they apply equally well to business of any nature. If you read this book, absorb all of the lessons, and practice them in your daily activities, then you will have learned the most important lesson in your business life"

books,1 of 1,4.0,Insect Bites,"Overall, Star Wars RPG is a good system. Its very easy to learn if you've played D20 Modern especially. I wouldn't say that there are any big problems with the game system, but there are certainly a lot of minor problems that would be very confusing/frustrating to someone without a rules lawyer who understands game balancing. Its a fun game for roleplaying, but I'm not sure Wizards had any really competant game-balancing rules lawyers actually look over the system, or maybe they didn't play test it enough. Either way, the system has a number of very minor game unbalancing things that spring up in game from time to time that require a comptetant GM to resolve. Nothing especially terrible, and overall I enjoy the system as do many of the people I play with. So I would recommend the system to any Star Wars and roleplaying enthusiasts (in that order)."

The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.  Wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn't give one whit about the British (or anyone else's) false boast of superiority. In the end, though, it's a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren't biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn't survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that, it's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Every teacher should have this on their shelf!,"I used this book 10 years ago when I first began my career, and I still refer to it today.  It demonstrates the ability to direct kids in the correct manner while they develop their self-esteem, and their independence.  It gives you ways to deal with negative situtations that allows the child to walk away feeling like they can be a better person and they will be!"
books,36 of 36,5.0,A Must Have for Homeschooling Teens,"I have been homeschooling for 11 years now and I must say this has been one of the most useful publications I have come across.  I have already struggled through two teens with little help and not knowing where to turn for resources.  There is a great deal of information for the younger years, but very little for teens.  This book not only give you insightful information to make your teens education well rounded and interesting, but it also provides a wealth resources to turn for further information.  No homeschool should be without it"
books,,4.0,Delicious Fast,Jaques offers a number of fast dishes that taste like they've been cooking all day.  The recipes are easy to follow and brought a fresh new taste to my kitchen.  I frequently turn to this book both on a busy weeknight after work and a lazy Sunday afternoon.  The book is a companion to the TV show that currently airs on public television.  It is by no means all inclusive but certainly worth having in your kitchen - Pick it up

books,,4.0,Very Pleasing,"Having read a few other books by Silva I figured this would be good. No mistake, it was very good. I enjoyed his walking you through all the steps in the tracking of a Terrorist. What has to be done and sometimes hurting your own to accomplish the capture. All in all a very well written book. I recommend it highly"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A gorgeous ending to a timeless story,"I usually read every night to my wife.  We've gone through dozens of books together in our marriage, and several months ago, I read ""All the Pretty Horses"" to her.  She loved it, and would not let me read her anything else until we had read McCarthy's entire trilogy.  We just finished it."
books,5 of 6,5.0,History of our modern obsessions,"This book was an amazing journey that helped me understand the underpinnings of the modern American woman's relationship with sexuality.  By tracing the roots of our modern traditions to their Victorian foundations, Brumberg educates the reader and also paints a stark picture of the way young girls have started to come into their sexuality in the past few decades.  She argues that girls today are out of sync, that their bodies develop before they are emotionally ready to deal with issues of sexuality.  She further asserts (and proves, in my opinion) that the historical move away from home-based economies and social structures has robbed modern girls of vital mentoring from their adult female relatives.  This lack of female mentoring leads to the confusion and insecurity that anyone who watches MTV cannot deny is rampant today.  This book is an important read for educators, parents, and anyone interested in unerstanging how (and why) young women today experience sexualization by a culture all too ready to exploit their insecurities for profit.  All in all, a fascinating and very readable study of a crucial subject"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Great travel book.,"I have read this book two times, once as a teenager and now 40+ years later.  It is a great book and easy to read.  I was amazed as a teen ager, and now, how such a famous author would do such an ordinary thing as travel around America in a camper and write about it.  He can do more than write well about things, he shows how to really observe and absorb experiences around him"
books,5 of 6,5.0,Excellent,"I had to read this for a US History class I took in college and when I received it, groaned at the size of the book.  But when I started reading it, I found that I really enjoyed it.  It gives more information than your average history textbook but enough to inspire you to do further research on topics contained within the book.  Its a big one - but very interesting so you won't mind that at all.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I wish that I didn't have to stop and highlight and take notes as I was reading because this could be purely a """"leisurely"" read if you are into history"
books,,5.0,A wonderful but disturbing book.,"I had a little difficulty getting this book, but I'm glad that I did finally find it.  It is a wonderful mystery, even though the subject behind the mystery is disturbing.  I know that I knew about research done on live animals, but I never thought about with dogs somehow.  I pictured lab rats and mice.  It goes against everything that I believe in to use our domestic best friends for product testing and experiments.  But the mystery was good, and I enjoyed Holly and her friends again.  Ms. Conant knows how to write a story while she bravely uncovers some less than desirable facts about big business.  This is a wonderful series for dog lovers, or for any animal lovers if it comes to that"

books,,5.0,"Fun, interactive helpful read","I use this book in my work doing animal assisted interventions with at-risk children.  The kids love learning how a dog's brain works - or more likely how dogs are driven to pleasure-seeking behavior.  The pictures can also be pretty powerful - particulary the page ""good dog"" and ""bad dog"" with the split brain - this is very helpful teaching children about how our brain actually divides itself at times under stress.  When I explain this in the picture - the kids feel so much better about themselves.  Great work"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Listening to Isaac's Storm,"I listened to Isaac's Storm on CD while painting a room, and it made the time fly!  The CD rendition was clearly spoken and had excellent production value.  That said, I also loved the story.  I am a weather-hound, and I enjoyed the detail of the way in which the nation maintained it's weather bureau.  (I had recently read ""The Children's Blizzard"" and I would consider this as a nice companion book for we weather-hounds.)  The descriptions from survivors was threaded effectively along with a panoramic view of the Galveston tragedy.  I have not read the book, but I found the CD riveting."

The basics of finance are covered along with insights on where financials some from, how they influence decisions different ways when used with different formulas and purposes, and how they can be biased. The authors have trained thousands of managers and employees in the course of their business: their expertise lends to plenty of insights here."

books,29 of 47,2.0,started really well....but I was duped...buyer beware,"I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present."

As a dual diagnosis counselor I have found this book to be an invaluable resource.  The psychopharmacology of both drugs of abuse and mental health medications are explained in a detailed manner that is very accessible.  I find it a valuable resource in helping me educate clients about drug action

I don't have very clear memories of it, but I remembered it as being very hard to read, and I remember not getting very far in it before I lost interest."
books,3 of 3,2.0,Disappointing,"I believe that this book might be interesting for someone who is unfamiliar with value investing, but I must warn the more experienced reader that not much of new ideas are to found in this book. What surprises me most of all is that the author devotes the first half of his book to  convincing people that marekts are inefficient. But what guy believing in efficient markets would ever consider buying a book on investing in the first place ? Right: anyone interested in this book can skip the first half. The second half is rather superficial and brings nothing new on the table for people familiar with value investing. My advice: avoid this book and buy instead 'The essays of Warren Buffet' of the same author. The latter is really a must-read for anyone serious about investing"

I am president of a small company and immediately took the ideas and practices out of this book and applied them to great success.  This is not a quick read, and every item will not pertain to each individual person, but the observations presented explained a huge number of obstacles I was facing.  If you are trying to manage any form of modern organization, buy this book and spend the time reading it.  It made me a huge Drucker fan"
books,1 of 1,4.0,A fun book for culinary anthropologists,"It is a good book to find popular American recipes.  Cookies and quickbreads are delicious, and my husband likes the casserole chapter.  As I was born and raised outside the U.S., the tidbits about American culinary history in the book are very fascinating.  I had to try exotics like soup mongole (a Campbell combination soup), and I admit it is pretty good.  The ethnic recipes that entered American mainstream are often Americanized, but it should not be surprising because it is the American Century Cookbook after all"
books,6 of 6,4.0,Reading Pictures,"This book is an outstanding guide for the art teacher eager to teach not only creative photography, but how to connect, understand, and tell a story through a picture. This book teaches expression through exercises with video and poetry, how to read a photograph, to have children from different cultures learn from each other from self portrait exercises in the shoes of different ethnicities."

books,3 of 4,5.0,Accessible Economics,"An economist's book written so regular folks can finally understand how and why capitalism is a distinctly American animal. The Mystery of Capital provides a plain-language explanation of the foundation and founding of capitalism in the US and why its export to third-world and former communist nations have, thus far, been unsuccessful. Then it outlines logical methods necessary for making capitalism accessible in any country. Excellently researched, exceptionally well-written"
books,5 of 7,4.0,Insightful!,"Peter Burrows offers insights into high level business, where personality matters more than economics, as he explores the mammoth HP-Compaq merger. Most mergers fail to make money or to produce the promised ""synergies"" so, he asks, why - other than ego - do CEOs pursue them? Though stylistically somewhat trite, this book successfully explores the HP Board's decision to approve the merger, with Walter B. Hewlett's vote in favor, and his subsequent lonely, ultimately quixotic battle against it. The most contentious issues in contemporary business are all here: shareholder rights and value vs. CEO power; employee-oriented cultures vs. ""re-engineering;"" corporate integrity vs. sharp practice; and the interesting spectacle of a ruthless, hard-headed female CEO pitted against a sensitive, cello-playing man. The author says Hewlett-Packard executives were told not to speak with him after he quoted merger critics in Business Week, so there is an inevitable Walter Hewlett bias. We found this to be a very good read, even a must read, for corporate warriors"

books,,5.0,Wow! Such an intriguing book. . .,"False Memory was the first Dean Koontz book that I read, and I was enthralled from page one. Koontz's descriptions pull you into the story and his suspense is chilling.

books,3 of 3,5.0,What An Awesome Book,"I love this book. It isn't dogmatic and it doesn't so much alter one's thinking as it does challenge someone to pay attention to the nature of individual perception. Perception is not as it's claimed  ""everything"" but it does go a long way toward shaping how a person views the world, and Pooh is simply a master of life. What else can you say"
books,34 of 37,5.0,FANTASTIC BOOK - SUPERBLY  WRITTEN!,"What is impressive about this book is the author's concepts of healing both heart and mind as he points out just how closely the two are interconnected.  The writing style is one that will grasp the reader's attention from start to finish.  The approach to holistic health is a welcome approach to healing. It is a concept that is gradually increasing in the health care field, but one that still has a long way to go before it is universally accepted by all physicians.  More education and information needs to be provided in this area to all health care providers. Using the holistic approach,  there can be fewer side effects from medication, less depression and a general feeling of well being during the most trying and difficult times.  There is much to be said on combining Western and Eastern traditions in the process of healing.  Our world can benefit dramatically from this approach and the author vividly explains why throughout the pages of this well-researched and superbly written book.  It is highly recommended reading material and most deserving of a five star rating"

books,2 of 2,4.0,"You say Ashtanga, I say Astanga","This book is a classic and David Swenson is well loved by the yoga community. I'll admit that I find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes. (David did the design and layout himself). But, you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import. Overall, I find David's voice friendly, supportive and unassuming. He does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students. This book covers a lot of information, including Primary Series and Intermediate Series."
books,,4.0,Powerful and Moving,"When I read this book, I was completely impressed with the author's power to draw you into the scene of the story. I mean, I was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses - and I've never seen them in real life. This book is very well-written, and the imagery is powerful and moving."

One thing was for sure; Frank wanted money and women."

books,1 of 1,5.0,First-Rate True Saga of the Sea,"I first discovered &quot;Grey Seas Under&quot; about 15 years ago, appropriately enough as Able Seaman on an Ocean Salvage Tug. I was immediately enthralled. Out of the many books on the sea I have read, this one remains very dear to me (not that you have to be a mariner to enjoy it). Grey Seas Under is the true story of the ocean salvage tug, FOUNDATION FRANKLIN and the brave men who battled the North Atlantic to save hundreds of ships and thousands of lives. Farley Mowat, a master srory-teller, passionately desribes the exploits of FOUNDATION FRANKLIN with geat admiration and humor. Grey Seas Under is a true masterpiece saga of the sea. I've read this book probably 6 times in the last 10 years and I'm sure to re-read it for many years to come. I cannot recommend this book enough.  I also highly recommend &quot;The Serpents Coil&quot; also by Farley Mowat, another first-rate tale of the sea"
books,2 of 3,5.0,A book which raises many questions.......,"What more can be said which already hasn't of this extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man of courage?  With 900+ reviews, I will not make this an overly elaborate review, as the book simply does not require it.  Elie Wiesel's story is one of one man's courage, will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost; friends, family, belongings, even basic human dignity."
books,2 of 9,5.0,EXCELENTE !!!!! Great Book,"The book ""Options, Futures and Other Derivatives"" is for me the best book out there for Finance majors and professionals. I haven't finished the book but I feel confident now to review it. The structure and presentation of the book feels right, it starts with an introduction to Forwards, Futures and Option contracts and it later builds slowly on the mechanics of markets and the determination of their prices. Then it moves to more complex instruments and subjects (in my opinion) like the pricing of these instruments (Black & Scholes, Binomial Trees, etc.)  and some risk management instruments like Value at Risk. In synthesis this book is a most have for any finance major or professional. There is not much I can say that it hasn't been said before. This book is the one that will give any student the necessary foundation to dwell into the more advance topics and pricing calculations. The only thing, I would like to recommend is that this book could be used with the Financial Toolkit of Matlab. It is a great teaching combination in my opinion. Currently my work prohibits me from teaching but if I could I would give classes of Derivatives using this book (+) Matlab. I think it is a nice combination and it helps students that don't have the necessary mathematical background to understand it right away. John C. Hull is one of our most valuable authors we have in the Financial Industry and his book should always be regarded as a jewel of finance"
books,20 of 21,5.0,A must-read for those interested in Victorian England,"Henry Mayhew, founder of Punch magazine, wrote this four-volume  sociological classic during the 1850's.  If you are at all interested in  the Victorian era, in British history, in London, or in urban history in  general, this is a must-read.  The Penguin version is abridged and is a  distillation of the &quot;best&quot; of the multiple-volume set.  This  distillation is itself over 500 pages, so imagine the impact of the entire  set!  The utter destitution of the London poor is set out in such vivid  detail than one cannot help being shocked at the conditions human beings  were forced to live in in the greatest city of its time.  The only fault I  find with this book is Mayhew's occasional lapses into preaching.   Otherwise a fine boo"
books,10 of 10,5.0,Great book - May help you realize why you haven't been losing weight,"This book has really opened my eyes up to one thing...why I hadn't lost weight. I've been dieting since I had my son but  hit a plateu. I hadn't been exercising regularly and with a long commute to work 3 hours round trip) and then sitting at a desk all day, I wore the pedometer before trying anything in the book to see how many steps I was getting before making a conscious effort. I was shocked to learn that I had only been taking 1500-2500 steps a day, on days I worked. Days I didn't work I averaged more around 5-6,000. Still that wasn't very good since the book gives you a minimum of 10,000 a day."
books,3 of 7,1.0,Could have been summarized in about 5 pages,"Deadline follows the two-year fictitious journey of IS project manager Webster Tompkins, illustrating the lessons he learns along the way. I bought this book primarily due to the great reviews it garnered on Amazon.com. After all, you can't go wrong when a book rates 4.5 out of 5 stars from over 25 readers, can you? Yep. This book was terrible, because of two very big problems: the book didn't say very much in 300+ pages and what it did say I don't agree with (it also tends to contradict much of Tom Peter's 'In Search of Excellence'). Or, to state it another way, the book points out about five very useful lessons/pieces of information, but takes forever to do so. Those lessons could have been summarized in about five pages--with compelling examples."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Wonderful Book for all ages!,"I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. Now I'm 21 and recendly read it again, and I liked it even more. The plot is great.

books,6 of 6,5.0,One of the Best Dog Training Books,"I highly recommend Gerilyn J. Bielakiewicz's ""The Only Dog Training Book You Will Ever Need"" which gives you the A-Z of raising those cute but oftentimes unruly pups. The book is written for novices in mind and had been a major life-saver when I was at a complete loss as to what to do when I adopted a 3-month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi (a notoriously difficult breed to raise) a couple of months ago. The book delves into the highly effective method of clicker training for dogs at length, resulting in my teaching my pup over 10 commands in just days (!). Betsy Brevitz's ""Hound Health Handbook"" is also another excellent reference book which offers credible advise from a writer-turned-vet behind the award-winning website, .... These books are must-read for owners who are experiencing problems in obedience training and/or understanding their dogs. Prospective owners who are contemplating what breed to buy and the pros and cons of adopting a dog to complete their lives and homes will also find them useful. ""Puppies for Dummies"" is another book written with the novice in mind: it offers practical clues like playing classical CDs on repeater mode while owners have to leave their dogs alone; to not make a song and dance when owners have to depart for work or retire to bed(no-no to ""grandiose departures/returns gestures""); to what to look out in dog food labelling et al. 5 Stars for their comprehensive contents, readability and effectiveness!"
books,,5.0,An Invaluable Frame of Reference,"Carter is a master of framing and providing a context for complex issues like integrity. This is NOT a preachy book with platitudes about the need for integrity. It IS about defining integrity, the situations where it will be tested, and ways to think about integrity as you make your own decisions. In the end, it is a powerfully enabling book that I have referred to and recommended to friends and colleagues repeatedly for many years"

books,1 of 3,5.0,Get Lost in a Good Book,"I was a bit annoyed by The Eyre Affair but also intriqued about the book jumping and time travel. So I read this sequel and found it to be more fun :) that I am willing to forget my bugs with the first book. The jump can happen from-to a book, between one book to another, sometimes to something that was not a book at all! Just a 3-4 lines of washing instruction could do the trick ;) While the time travel with Next's father was exhilarating."
books,2 of 2,4.0,weLEAD Book Review from the Editor of leadingtoday.org,"This book is co-authored by David L. Steward and he is a true success story! He has risen from humble beginnings, and confronted many personal setbacks to become founder and CEO of the largest African-American owned company in the United States. Doing Business by the Good Book is his personal story of the faith and perseverance that he credits for his success. Steward shares 52 principles from the Bible that he believes were intended to be implemented in business strategy and conduct. This is not simply a book that blandly presents 52 Biblical principles. It is David Steward's own story of how these 52 principles impacted his personal and family life to eventually build World Wide Technology, Inc., a privately held billion-dollar company. Doing Business by the Good Book is almost like reading a private diary. Steward discusses his own vivid experiences to teach about business management, ethics, strategy and personal leadership. At the heart of his value system are the Biblical scriptures frequently mentioned throughout the book. A central theme is his belief that giving and serving others is an essential ingredient to becoming highly successful.

books,9 of 10,5.0,"Re: A good book, but overall, a mixed bag","I was personally a little confused with the review written by Patty Benson, who claims that Sarah Ban Breathnach is Jewish and that is why she makes so many refrences regarding the Jewish religion. To begin with the author is not Jewish, she was raised Catholic. So the book is full of ""Non-Jewish wisdom."" Secondly, the book is not about religion which I feel people might assume from the previous review, the book incorporates elements from all religions and searches out the spirtual aspects within each that can be universally appreciated by everyone. And yes sometimes this does include quotes from Jewish mystics. If you're looking for a book that excludes the world at large and focuses on Christianity then perhaps you should read The Purpose Driven Life. If you're looking for a book that embraces the idea of ""spirit"" and tries to relate it to all walks of life then you should read Simple Abundance."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Your Wish is My Command!,"Brent Hartinger (the author of GEOGRAPHY CLUB) here. I wanted to respond to the previous reviewer. I really am sorry you found my book boring. I admit that's not a criticism I've heard before (and I thought I'd heard it ALL about this book--that it's inappropriate for teenagers, that it's too realistic, that it's not realistic enough, that it's too mainstream, that it's not mainstream enough, etc., etc.). If anything, people usually say there's almost too MUCH going on, or that the book moved so quickly, they wanted it to be longer."

books,12 of 12,5.0,A few good people . . .,"This account of one man's efforts to revise the defintion of ""entrepreneur"" demonstrates the capacity of what can be achieved from small beginnings.  Bill Drayton has created a ""consulting"" firm that girdles the world.  Creator and promoter of Ashoka, a foundation dedicated to social change, Drayton uses a highly selective arrangement to locate and encourage people desiring social change.  Their efforts, rarely, if ever, depicted in either mainstream media or even specialty publications, are here explained and endorsed.  As is Drayton's unorthodox methods.  Yet those methods, and the people adapting them to local conditions, have been demonstrably successful.  They need further study and application."
books,3 of 5,4.0,"Bitter, angry and worth every penny.","This book uses the information that is a matter of public record to examine the phenomenon of Wal-Mart.  As the author says early on there are no secret memos revealed or other shocking new information.  Unfortunately this means that there are so many other things he doesn't report.  That being said however, this book is almost too small for what it contains.  He could have easily written a book 3 times the size with a little more in depth work.  The author does jump from one topic to the next pretty quickly so be prepared to keep up."
books,,5.0,Another absorbing book by this writer,"With some interesting twists and a complicated plot, this author grips the reader. Baseline story involves a good cop, a failed one who makes a living after resigning from the police force and struggles with a drinking problem, and a retired one who become involved after a murder hauntingly familiar to an unsolved one from many years ago by a serial killer who was never caught. In the course of attempting to solve the murder, a dirty cop is unearthed. The violent ending resolves part of the mystery. Along the way, good insight is offered into the lives of the police and their everyday struggles with the overwhelming crime rate in D. C. This author is widely admired for the pace of his novels, making them hard to put down. Crisp dialogue, excellent settings, and believeable characters as well as sharp observations about today's world make the book an excellent read."

Then he starts seeing crazy little guys and people with balloons attached to their heads!I would start seeing things too if I went without sleep for a few nights. I was hoping that a clown named Pennywise with a stack of balloons would appear since this book is set in Derry Maine but no such luck. I  think somebody should buy King an Atlas because he seems to be unaware of any other locations  except Maine which does get rather tiresome after awhile. There are  a couple of subplots about a wife beater and abortion in this book but I find it to be a very good subsitute for Seconal. I give this book 5 stars because it seems King is still trying to ""live up"" to the promising writer that he once was 20 years ago"

books,,4.0,Fine addition to the Reacher series,"This is an excellent addition to the Reacher series.  Reacher is relying more on guile than violence these days, and this outing requires his inflicting only some broken bones and I believe four fatalities.  The plot is nicely convoluted, although a clever reader will early on suspect that all is not as it seems.  The characters are well developed, and the major locales -- New York and rural England -- are evoked more than adequately.  Lee Child's work is definitely a cut or two above the field in all respects, with the writing quality more than high enough not to present distractions from the story."
books,9 of 19,5.0,The agrarian ethic is essential to our survival,"As a fan of Barbara Kingsolver's nonfiction I recommend the book's Foreword, in particular, for a personal and incisive statement of the agrarian ethic and its relevance for this time.

And I do not accept the book's analysis.  These fantastic canine responses could not have happened as the book asserts.
books,3 of 5,5.0,A Magical Journey,"In her book, A Great Improvisation, Pulitzer Prize biographer Stacy Schiff once again sets the standard by which all biographies should be measured in our times.  Somehow, and this is the magic, she combines research and accuracy worthy of the term scholarship with a novelist's ability to create a world into which readers completely lose themselves. As you read, you magically fall into another era, to a time before ubiquitous technology, and when information (did this word even have the same meaning then?) was delayed, imperfect, and unverifiable (no Google).  I could actually feel the noise of all the technology to which we have become accustomed fall away to create a stillness that is then filled with personalities.  And, Benjamin Franklin is personality that could fill a room, span an ocean, and make a country"

At least, in my experience, this is the normal course.  If psychologists are the experts in this arena, then what's the problem?"

Now, when I go to the county records department in my pre-foreclosure's county and confirm my online research findings to this particular pre-foreclosure I'm pursuing, I have actual forms to fill in with very important data that I need to make a good final decision, about the foreclosure, thanks to Mr. Lucier's book. After thoroughly reading this book, I feel like I know the secret codes to buried treasure and no one else does.

Thank you Mr. Lacier for writing this book, I look forward to the next one."
books,1 of 2,4.0,Keeps You Guessing Til the End,"In this involving and complicated story, David Baldacci covers everything from drug dealing, to cults, to the FBI, to pyschoanalyis and hypnotism.  There's also a horse farm and pornography thrown in for good measure!  The main plot deals with the character of Web London, the sole survivor of a botched mission by HRT (Hostage Rescue Team), a part of the FBI; as he and his companions are en route to tackle a drug lord, London suddenly collapses, unable to continue, as if paralyzed.  He then is forced to witness his colleagues' massacre as they are shot by remote control weaponry as they enter an urban courtyard.  London's determination to discover what happened to him and clear his name makes up the bulk of the novel.  In his journey, he is forced to confront childhood abuse, and the possible abuse of his psychiatrist.  Baldacci tells the story from several points of view, and should be credited with creating complex and compelling characters who are both heroic and flawed.  On the good side, this helps when the plot becomes increasingly complicated; on the potentially bad side, the characters are, not surprisingly, unhappy with their lives, and there's not a `happy' ending for most of them.  The pain gets a little much at times, even though the `good' guys win at the end. The end is abrupt, and leaves you wondering if you missed something. Worth reading, just concentrate on the plot, or it will get away from you"
books,,5.0,Not so formulaic as I expected,"Vince Flynn started his series of Mitch Rapp books about a decade ago. Actually, the first book he wrote wasn't even part of the series, but all of the other ones since have been. All of his books have a political element to them, and all of them are thrillers written with a take-no-prisoners protagonist who kills first and half the time doesn't bother asking questions later. They're all long, and as Flynn has continued to write the books have gotten longer. Of the four I've read in sequence, the lengths were (in order) ca. 430 pgs., 480, 530, and 670. Those are approximate, but about right. He's actually getting better, though, something that happens to these guys sometimes."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"...towards morning, a thin, fine rain began, misty and dull.","The Haunting of Hill House has to be one of the best written books I have ever read.

books,,4.0,Welcome To The Real Word,"One of the best books that I read this year. ""There Are No Children Here"" is about two brothers try to fit into there world. These two brothers are deciding who they are.  The two brothers are Lafeyette and his younger brother Pharoah. This book takes place in the Chicago projects. At the Henry Horner Homes. Everyday these boys only see violence. They see drugs, gangs, and murder. Lafeyette and Pharoah mother LaJoe talks to a report who is a writer for magazines.  The report ask LaJoe ""Can I talk to the children here"" she says ""There no children here"" As Lafeyette and Pharoah grow up they only have a mom.

What will happen to these two brother while grow up in the Chicago projects? Will they hang with Gangs and do drugs or will they try to make it out of the Projects and be someone. While read this book you feel like you are in the story, you feel like you are the report write everything. You could really see this really happen.

From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the ""Christmas [...]"" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris"

The denial of Christian suffering by Christians who lived among Moslems is a phenomenon that is always overlooked.  As Christians who live in Egypt, neither Said nor I could marry a Moslem woman unless we convert to Islam; as Christians neither Said nor I would be allowed entrance to some Arab cities; as Christians, neither Said nor I would be allowed to build a church without permission from the President of Egypt.

books,,5.0,A thought provoking piece,"A Tme to Kill, the debut novel from Acclaimed writer John Grishman deals with the thinly threaded storylines dealing with a rape and attempted murder of a [young] black girl.  Soon after race issues boil over as protesters on both sides of the fences barrier over the woodwork. Grishman expertly narrarates this complex issue by focusing on the more simplistic, organic notions of the case, and the bodies that are affected by each decision that is made.  True, the ending seems rather rushed and he certainly could of filled another 50-100 pages without question, but in the long run everyone believes that this magnificent story of Racial disharmony in present day and age end up asking, not answering, questions that need to be asked. Grishman was quoted in the reprinted foreword in saying he wouldn't change a word.  With a story like that, you can see that he doesn't need to, compelling storytelling will always be compelling storytelling. In the End Grisham nails it out of the park, and leaves his readers yearning for more"

books,3 of 4,5.0,Poignant and Powerful Story,"As referenced in the preface, according to the Children's Defense Fund, one in every three children lives in poverty in the city of Chicago- a remarkably higher rate than the rest of the country. Alex Kotlowitz's national bestseller ""There Are No Children Here"" depicts the poignant and powerful story of two brothers, Lafeyette and Pharoah, growing up in one of Chicago's most notorious public housing projects, the Henry Horner Homes. Although this is a story of hardship and tragedy, it is also a story of courage, hope and love. Kotlowitz chronicles the lives of Pharoah and Lafeyette as they confront racism and violence in their own community. This extraordinary story exposes the fact that two parallel worlds still persist in this county and how Inner-city America continues to be defined by poverty and violence and is maintained by institutionalized racism and social inequalities."

books,1 of 3,5.0,Wow-This is more than just a Great Thriller,"In 3rd degree James patterson not only produces great thrills and fantastic characters he also provides a very profound message that is surprisngly scary. This book is fiction but something like this could very well happen one day considering the story focuses alot around protestors. The August Spies bomb this house in the first two chapters and as Lindasy and the Womens Murder Club delve deeper they realize a surprising motive which leads to sadly, one of the Women from the club to be murdered. Like with Pattersons last two murder club series there are those classic little twists and an even better ending that makes you feel satisifed. But unlike the last two this one delt more with politics and was very confusing at times. There was also more characters than usual and it was very confusing because alot of the characters had aliases which made it very confusing because you couldn't figure out which character from the August Spies was which. The way this book ends may for some people like me, send a chill down your back even though there is a typical happy ending but the message is very surprisng. Once again Patterson proves why he is one of the best if not the best at writng thrillers"

books,2 of 2,5.0,fun read for the mathematicallly curious,"I picked up this book after watching the movie A Beautiful Mind -- it's a delightful, easy-to-read novel about an aspiring mathemetician who tries to get to know the truth about his eccentric mathemetician uncle.  The book details the uncle's life-long struggle to solve Goldbach's Conjecture, which (for you non-mathemeticians, like me) posits that every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes.  I felt like the novel showed a somewhat realistic perspective of a driven, obsessed scientist, and showed how the scientist's activities and behaviors affected and even alienated those around him.  The protagonist is the only member of the mathemetician's family who bothers to get to know and appreciate him -- and that is a struggle, as the mathemetician often does things to alienate his nephew.  Don't be put off by the math; it's actuallyq quite easy to read"

Robert Kirkman has been doing this to some extent in ""The Walking Dead"" all along, but perhaps more conscientiously with the third volume ""Safety Behind Bars"".  After the events of last volume, Rick, Lori and company find an abandoned prison which, ironically, is the perfect place to hide out from the dead wandering the world.  But there are still a few human prisoners, and while they seem a reasonable lot, it soon becomes clear that even when the dead roam outside, and humanity is on the ropes, a serial killer still feels free to act on his sick desires."

books,1 of 2,5.0,The Odd Couple,"David Kindred has written what amounts to a duel biography of the controversial odd couple that is Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell.  The author tells us that Ali elected to not join the military because the Muslim Nation told him not to.  To cross them was to literary toy with his life.  The assassination of Malcolm X being used as an example.  While not necessarily agreeing with Ali's decision Cosell supported Ali stating that taking his heavyweight championship away from him without any semblance of due process was completely wrong.  There appears to be evidence that Cosell may have already been experiencing dementia when he came out with his second book entitled I Never Played the Game.  Aware of the criticism in his book of his cronies in the TV booth for Monday Night Football Cosell was asked before publication whether he wanted to include these strong opinions.  Since he always prided himself on telling it ""like it is"" he felt it would be hypocrisy of him not to do so now.  Cosell was a devoted family man while Ali ventured into nocturnal delights.  It was hard for sports fans to be neutral in regard to either of these men, but boxing was the ingredient that brought these two men together first in mutural respect and then in friendship.  Incidentally, page 247 has a hilarious anecdote of Howard using his colorful vocabulary in breaking up fisticuffs involving teens in Kansas City.  Whether you are a fan of either man or the part they played in sports you will find this to be an extremely enjoyable book to read."

books,5 of 12,2.0,"Too much info, not enough fact","Of course I want to restore my mind and body!  The title alone made me want to read the book.  However most of the &quot;miraculous&quot; claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study.  Those who are skeptical of traditional Western medicine MIGHT enjoy reading this.  However, I found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you.  Too good to be true usually is"

books,8 of 9,5.0,A fun way to talk about healthy eating.,"I have a 2 year old and a 5 year old and it has been a bedtime favorite for a couple of months. The story is fun and the characters are cool and colorful. Since the characters are fruits and vegetables, the book furnishes you with a fun way to talk about healthy eating"
books,,5.0,Original Crime,"I have read everything Mr Pelecanos has written and generally find his work to be thoughtful and original. The Night Gardener is his best work to date. The stories are interesting and well paced. But it the characters and the subtlety with which they are drawn and brought together that makes this book special. The conclusion is thought provoking and important. It is true to the characters and believable. All in all a great book - Mr Pelecanos has packed so much into 372 pages, in itself this is an impressive feat."
books,18 of 21,5.0,The greatest cooking book!!,"I have been looking for the cooking book that I can really trust for the taste.  I used to love cooking with challengeful recipes, but with my baby, I just don't have enough time for the long complicated recipes anymore.  When I saw this book first I just wanted to try the skillet recipes.  It just looked very simple and quick.  I really just followed the instruction step by step and both my husband and I agreed it was super delisious.  Not only that! They are easy to follow (very detailed instructions) and most of all, very quick to get done by dinner time even though I'm always busy with my baby!!  Thanks heavens :"

books,1 of 4,4.0,Good Breakdown of Leadership Styles,This book is much more useful than his first two books on EI. It does a nice job of defining and describing the various leadership styles
books,3 of 5,1.0,"Shallow, uninspiring, uninteresting","As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet.  However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted"
books,1 of 1,4.0,What NOT To Do When You're Expecting...,"I guess it's high praise for Mr. Iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child:  free-diving, drinking, Valium, baths in scalding water."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Chinese Lessons,"This is an excellent book, written by someone who has lived many years in China, married a Chinese wife, yet remains objectively concise in analyzing China's unique approach to business, cultural, and personal relationships.  As we become ever more intertwined with Asian, and especially Chinese influences, this book is critical to our understanding and to merging our national interests with China's interests"
books,0 of 1,4.0,Reasonably good coverage of the intricacies & idiosyncracies of the mind...heavy going in many ways!,"As a layman (even athough I was trained as an engineer), I was quite ambivalent when faced with the ultimate purchase decision for this book, especially after I have read most of the editorial & readers' reviews on the net. I was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author & his book. My decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick - over 600 pages - & the apparent level of complexity, judging from my random five-finger test."
books,6 of 7,5.0,Economic Common Sense,"With ""Free to Choose"", Milton Friedman has achieved an easy to understand and common sense guide to understanding economics. Mr. Friedman answers questions such as: What is price and how does price convey information in a free vs. socialist market? What are the implications of legislation artificially controlling price? What drives commodity prices such as oil? How do economic and political freedoms coincide? What alternatives are there to a better public education? What should be the role of government in a free society? Mr. Friedman provides lucid answers and alternatives to issues that are commonly attacked by an appeal to the emotions of the masses. To really understand the concepts, this book must be studied. Taking time to understand Mr. Friedman's concepts can help clear many misconceptions and confusion about the economy as well as our day-to-day lives. The knowledge gained from this book is invaluable and may forever change the way you think."

I am familiar with Chomsky's reputation as a prolific writer of books on politics. I've tried to plow through some of his works on linguistics. Not easy, although the sense one gets as a non-scholar is that he is onto something original in those works."
books,23 of 23,4.0,If you live paycheck to paycheck....or even if you don't,"First off, If you make minimum wage or live paycheck to paycheck, this book may NOT change your immediate situation.  IF every cent you have is going to necessities (food, clothing, utilities, rent/mortgage), you may not have a penny left over. You may even be living with the help of credit cards and getting deeper in debt."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Using profit motive to drive development and entreprenuership in developing countries,"What is really good about this book is that it proposes a framework and then illustrates it with case studies. Aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth, improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models, distribution channels, product development or business processes.Having grown up and worked in India in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued."
books,21 of 23,5.0,An absolutely fabulous book,"This is the second Disney 4-in-1 Audio Storybook I purchased for my two kids (first being ""The Lion King, the Little Mermaid, Toy Story, Aladdin""). We absolutely love both these books! All the four stories have beautiful illustrations and the print is large and easy to read. The audio CD is fun to listen to, with lots of animations. The pages are of great quality that should suit kids'""rough""handling of the book and page turning."
books,2 of 5,4.0,Great Intro to a Better Understanding of the World,"If you want a better understanding of how the world has come to be what it today is, then this book is a good first step in so doing.  Braudel was an influential French historian specializing in the Mediterranean, so his insights into the evolution of Europe are more insightful than other regions he highlights (but he is insightful throughout).  Excellent book to read while you bask in the sun with your feet dancing in Lake Michigan on a tourist beach (as I did).  Maybe the atmosphere I had while reading made me enjoy it more; nonetheless, one should read this if they have any desire to"
books,16 of 18,4.0,"Mind Boggling, Scary....","There is some who would say that Bill is a right wing gun waving nutcase like one reviewer below. But I just think he/she/it is a liberal dupe. There is also lots and I mean lots of conservative dupes. I'd say Bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather. To dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong. There is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination. Their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the Federal Reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts. Do your homework and you'll see the crash of 29' was no accident. The IRS is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers. Now I don't know about the Illuminati  or Skull and Bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected. This book covers it all. Not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface. This is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt, slime and worms are. As for Bill's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first. Theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this. Either way this book is a good and informative read."

books,2 of 5,4.0,A good read,"This is my first experience with Ann Patchett and won't be my last. I loved her writing style even though the character development didn't always make sense. Why did everyone love Rose so much when she was so cold and shut down? The explanation for leaving Thomas, and her mother whom she loved deeply, didn't make sense to me. The story however was beautifully written albeit sad. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but I think that had to do with more with finding the Lorraine character incredibly annoying. I'm anxious to read my next Patchett novel."

I've read books from Sergio Zyman to Jay Conrad Levinson, and I feel Lee Silber's book ranks right up there. If you are a business owner or an entrprenuer, this book has hundreds of creative ideas to get your own word of mouth going and the ""buzz"" going about you and your work. Everyone knows that word of mouth is the key to new and continued business, but how do you generate it? How do you keep it going? What can you do to be different? How do you market what you do and have real success? All of these and many other questions are answered with very creative but sound business ideas. This is definitely a book to have in your personal and business library"

books,3 of 3,5.0,A Story Perhaps Only a Novelist Can Tell Well,"The story of the Cuban exiles in Miami deserves to be told with drama and passion because that is what it has been.  In this page-turner, Joan Didion captures the rejection and racism that the Cuban exiles first encountered in Miami when they emigrated from Cuba after Castro assumed power.  She shows how some of the Cubans became successful businesspersons, political powerbrokers, shapers of local culture, renowned humanitarians and philanthropists, expert propagandists, able diplomats, drug runners, muggers, and internationally renowned terrorists."
books,1 of 1,4.0,The Early Work of a Modern Master,"John Crowley is a treasure.  He combines gorgeous, haunting writing with a wealth of intelligent, thought-provoking ideas.  Otherwise collects his three early novels, all nominally science fiction but so far from the stereotypical forms of that genre as to almost deserve their own literary classification.  In each of these small but perfectly formed jewels, Crowley demonstrates complete control of his medium.  In barely 200 pages, he creates and destroys worlds, makes us fall in love with his characters, and leaves us wanting more."
books,,4.0,Judge & Jury Will Pull You In And Never Let You Go,"One of the things I love about James Patterson's books is his prose. It's a no-nonsense, no frills, ""I am what I am"" voice that doesn't try to entice you into the story with a lot of flowery language. In Judge & Jury, the story is written from a first-person perspective: that of FBI Senior Agent Nick Pellisante.  For years, Nick has been on the trail of a powerful Mafia don, named Dominic Cavello, and his efforts are about to pay off.  Nick trails Cavello to the wedding of his favorite niece and successfully captures him."

books,8 of 9,5.0,Unintentionally Classic,"It's a terrible book. The characters are uninteresting, the motivations are obscure, the machinery is obvious, the sex is strange and unerotic, the writing is terrible. But in spite of everything, Naked Came The Stranger is a hoot. There's nothing you can point at and say, ""This redeems"", but the book is so weirdly enjoyable that it really doesn't matter. Read it in autumn, hide it from your friends, finish it in an afternoon. One of my all-time favorites"

books,5 of 6,1.0,Confusing Nervous with Dishonest,"This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and ""hypnotizing"" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention"

He's received Emmy nominations for his TV work and won the Tony Award for his stage work - there should be an award for his smooth voice which perfectly captures the tension brewing from the story of deadly murders in New York City and a renowned criminologist who comes to realize the killer's future plans. This is audio at its best."

My 5 year old grand girl loves this book.  It's colorful characters and great story keep her interested from start to finish.

Hakakian is a delicious writer and her description of pre and post-revolutionary Iran is vivid and stimulating.

Sorcery, vampires, witches, time travel, battles and of course romance.  Do not even think about it just get the book and find a quiet place to settle down and get started"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Outstanding,"Simply put, this was an outstanding book. If you are a guy then Vince Flynn's books are for you.  Lots of action with just a touch of romance.  You become very attached to the characters, epsically Rapp and Rieley.  In the Mitch Rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that, very well written.  I am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but I finished this book in two days, impossible to put down"

books,1 of 1,5.0,The Measure of a Man,"About 20 years ago, I bemoaned the lack of heroes in our society. The ""anti-heroes"", the good-bad guys had taken over and there were only the ones you love to hate in the spotlight. Cormack McCarthy wrote the first volume of his trilogy around the same time and  I found some of the heroes I'd been looking for. McCarthy hasn't created his cowboy heroes, he communicated or maybe ""channeled"" them. It really seems to me that like some of the ancient storytellers, he  serves as a medium for the ancient voices. That is not meant to minimize Mr. McCarthy's talent. No-one has been more successful as he in capturing the language and personalities of real cowboys."

Personally, having read both Sedaris and Rakoff, two other fantastic humorists, I am rather partial to Vowell. Take the Cannoli seems to demonstrate her ability to both make us think and laugh. It seems that in most of her essays, I learn about as much as I laugh. Personally, I thought the title essay was extremely well done and is  deserving of much praise from the literary community"

books,11 of 19,5.0,a masterful account of modern china,"perhaps the finest correspondent to write on china over the last two decades, john pomfret's ""chinese lessons"" is a penetrating, insightful and frequently moving exploration of the transformations that have remolded much of china. only pomfret, whose immersion in china began with his language work at a chinese university, could write this book, a work that traces the lives of student colleagues he met twenty-five years ago, and through those lives he  elegantly and unsparingly chronicles the cataclysmic change that has swept the country. his intimate portraits are stunning in their detail, their passion, and their lessons. if there is one book i would recommend on the complexities and landscape of chinese society, it would be pomfret's superlative effort."
books,1 of 4,2.0,Not Everybody's Cup Of Tea,"13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale.  I think I've had enough of his novels"
books,1 of 3,4.0,Great,"Origionally I had checked this book out from the library, but it was so good I bought a copy for myself. The character development is very good, and the story (though it has a few ho-hum spots) is interesting and flows really nicely. However, this is not a scary book at all but really a rainy afternoon read"
books,,5.0,Great book,"This is a really good read, diffidently not a waste of time. I would recommed it to my family and friends. I would also like to recommed Scot Anderson's book ""Think Like a Billionaire Become a Billionaire."" it has truly changed my thinking and has taken off the limitations that we put on ourselves."
books,,5.0,A story about the western psyche,"All the Pretty Horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world.  His personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his West Texas upbringing.  His lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill, he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest.  His journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness, moral dilemnas, and cruel lessons about human nature and survival.  The best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by McCarthy.  His style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags, punctuation, and quotation marks.  This book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering"

books,5 of 5,4.0,"A nice light book of innocence, suburbia and baseball in the 50s","Doris Kearns Goodwin seems to have written a book about her growing up in the NY suburbs for her own pleasure of simply remembering the ""simpler"" days before free agency, adulthood and the pressures that come to all of us as we move along in years.  Her storytelling is at times pure magic, when it was the Dodgers of Brooklyn, the Yankees of The Bronx and the Giants of Manhattan and the Polo Grounds.  The hope of a baseball fan shows beautifully and reminds us all that we needn't lose all of our childish passion simply because the years pass.  One is reminded of the past couple of years with the Red Sox ending ""the Curse"" and the White Sox winning in style in the South Side of Chicago.  It leaves Cubs Nation truly understanding this concept - Next Year."

books,,4.0,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Coming in with four stars, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Holds its own among the finest books in the world. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, by J.K. Rowling is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series, and arguably the preeminent one. I'm not a real aficionado of books, so a rating of four stars means this is a practically flawless book.  The only downside is that the book is very extensive, and if you're an impatient reader this book is not for you. But there are more positive aspects to this book than negative ones. I say this because Harry Potter is not your typical witch and wizard novel. The book throws in a sense of reality among all the sorcery and spell casting.  You can sense the reality in the emotions of the characters, the way friendships play out, and how holidays are celebrated.  But it still captures the ways of the upcoming wizard- Harry Potter- by bringing to the book new spells, allies, and enemies.

He identifies the faults in Israel's policies and points out Israel's stubborness at achieving peace. He enlightens readers and angers Zionists, who are self-deluded by a belief that there cause is just. He uncovers the horrorific circumstances inflicted on Palestinians, some which match that of South Africa's former Apartheid. Shlaim has the courage and strength to produce the truth in a conflict that is riddled with so many lies."

books,,5.0,1776-Great Book for a Great Year,"David McCullough's 1776, an account of the American Revolution from the declaration of war in October of 1775 to the battle at Princeton in January of 1777, is well researched history told by a master story teller. The skill of the author is elegantly focused on the details of the Boston Siege, the rout at New York, the battle of Fort Washington, and the turning point battle of Trenton."

books,4 of 4,4.0,Frank Abagnale Jr.,"We all know of Frank Abagnale's personality; arrogant, yet kind with class. Among all the different characters that he chooses to play, whether he's a pilot, doctor, lawyer, or a college professor, i believe that Frank is somewhat confused of who he is. Frank ""ran away"" from home at 16; the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school. At 16, most people don't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future. One thing was for sure; Frank wanted money and women."
books,25 of 30,5.0,"Overall very strong on historical facts, definitely a lot of fun","I don't know if this is one of the essential historical works, but it is definitely one of the most fun.  Kenneth Davis strives to provide a remarkably comprehensive and centrist survey of American history by addressing a series of questions that structure the work as a whole.  For the most part, he articulates the standard current few of the various figures he treats."
books,,5.0,How to build a company you'd be proud of... and get rich from,"Jim Collins' books are well-researched, easy to read, and usually provide thoughtful, actionable guidlines for business owners. This book fits that mold in the context of describing precisely the framework that is needed to build a company that will both last a long time and outperform the market."
books,1 of 3,5.0,Best Book,"This is the funniest, best book I've ever read about the thoughts and emotions of new mothers.  Brett Paesel has had the courage to publish thoughts that I don't even admit I have.  Even my husband, who endured my reading it aloud to him, enjoyed it and totally relates to the scenarios Brett paints about her own husband."
books,7 of 7,4.0,Christian Enlightenment,"As a Christian, this book was incredibly inspiring.  I recently finished it and lately, when I come across a problem at work or school I remember various methods of thinking in order to solve the problem.  If there is no solution to the problem, I use a couple of methods to ""view"" the problem.  Dr. Peale uses countless examples and stories of experiences of people that have changed or developed by faith in God and the following of Christ."

books,1 of 1,4.0,End Time Delusions? Absolutely!!,"This is the second book by Steve Wohlberg that I have read.This book is more comprehensive than ""Truth Left Behind.""Mr. Wohlberg's books are easy reads.I'll state up-front that I don't agree with everything that he wrote.The identity of Israel in this book is basically replacement theology,or the idea of a ""spiritual Israel"".When considering that Revelation identifies 12 tribes in Rev.7:4-8(see also 21:12-13)I can't see Israel being a spiritual entity.Enough of the negative...The historicist view is very sensible when considering the source of the preterist and futuristic views of Revelation.I didn't know the history or source of these two theories before reading Steve Wohlberg's books.He exposes the flaws in both theories well.Why would the Church be spared tribulation when countless believers of the past were murdered for their beliefs?Check out ""Foxe's Book of Martyrs"".Steve Wohlberg does an excellent job in answering that question and more with the Bible.Take the Bible and a knowledge of history and you can learn a lot about the book of Revelation!While I do disagree on one point,I recommend this book as an answer to the fiction of the ""Left Behind"" series"
books,11 of 12,5.0,A gold mine,"These lectures are a gold mine about physics. I use the analogy of a precious metal lode in its full sense; nuggets that will make you wealthy mixed in gravel. For example, Feynman's discussions on Brownian motion, leading to the derivation of Binomial and Gaussian statistical distributions and the Central Limit Theorem are so insightful and profound that they border on being revealations. On the other hand, he spends just as much time talking about storms and lightening. (If I were one of his students in the lecture hall, that's when I'd work on the homework for my next class.)"
books,0 of 1,4.0,"Excellent book, bad language","I really am enjoying the audio recording of this book, but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word, to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous. I understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece, but I think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it."

books,45 of 46,5.0,How to get to the heart of the matter through conversation,"Susan Scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all ""pretending not to know"".  I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious."

C. Cook, hard-boiled Detective Sargeant and two near-rookies, Gus Ramone and Dan ""Doc"" Holiday. The Palindrome murders are never solved despite the obsession and skills of Cook. Flash forward to 2005. Gus Ramone is married now and has two mixed-race children. Dan Holiday left the police force under a cloud. T. C. Cook, long retired, has been forgotten by nearly all, along with the Palindrome murders."

books,1 of 1,5.0,An Excellent Look at the Stock Market,"This is one of the best books on the stock market.  I cannot imagine anyone doing a top-down analysis of the market without having first read this book.  Zweig, a Wharton graduate and PhD, looks at the monetary, momentum, and sentiment indicators (among others) that affect the DJIA, S&P 500, and the ValueLine(tm) Unweighted Price Index.  I think it is unfortunate that we have not heard from Dr. Zweig in quite some time (I cannot remember the last time I heard him mentioned on TV, and if I'm not mistaken his newsletter is no longer printed) and the book is somewhat dated (revised in 1997).  Still, Zweig's Winning on Wall Street is still a good read."
books,3 of 3,5.0,My favorite book of all time,"I must seem like someone in great need of a unifying philosophy, because several people have tried to lend me theirs. Ex-boyfriends seem to think Daoism just the thing, while acquaintances recommend Jesus (that's why they stall out at acquaintances).  After reading this book, though, I can now say, ""No thanks.  I've got Adam Smith."""
books,0 of 2,1.0,And then what?,"If we follow Ledeen off the Machiavellian cliff, what is left of the dream of the Founding Fathers for us to defend? This book illustrates one thing that is very important: in times of stress, normally intelligent people lose their sense of reason and let partisanship, xenophobia, or even megalomania rule their thoughts. Ledeen tells us to pursue the very course our forefathers rejected when they founded the USA, and he says it without the slightest trace of irony. Unfortunately for Ledeen, he negates his own title, for if we follow his prescription, those who ""hate our freedoms"" have already won by causing errant and misguided patriots to subvert the framework which supported those freedoms. Unfortunately for all of us, Ledeen has been taken seriously and literally by the Bush administration. Laws, Constitution, and even Geneva conventions are ignored because the end supposedly justifies the means. History says otherwise. Ledeen apparently believes that his book represents the moment in which historical patterns no longer apply to our world. Historians, if there are any left, will tell us whether he was right."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Phenomenal true story,"This book takes you through so many different emotions.  Kotlowitz does an amazing job weaving this documentary novel together.  It opens the eyes of suburban America.  This book inspired me to teach in the inner-cities.  A must-read for anyone going into teaching, public service...anyone with an interest in the social fabric of disadvantaged America"
books,10 of 11,5.0,Paradox and Principle,"This extraordinary book by Frank Rivers deserves more stars than would fit  on this page.  Frank Rivers deals with ideas formerly reserved for mysticm  and the most esoteric disciplines in a charmingly down to earth manner.  He  gets a lot of mileage out of the Owl analogy, and it works.  The reader,  male or female, can easily identify with both the fledgling and the wise  old owl of Frank River's examples. This fascinating treatise on conflict,  paradox and martial principle has so much more substance and clarity than  one would expect from such a relatively unknown work.  I especially  recommend it to readers who don't normally enjoy warm and fuzzies, or  self-help conflict-resolution type books.  I also recommend it to those  struggling with the inconsistencies and injustices of life. Again and again  Frank Rivers makes the principles of life, of reality and conflict, as  concrete and usable as an idea or words on paper can get. I plan to read  this book several times in the next few years. I put Frank Rivers &quot;The  Way of The Owl&quot; right up there with James Carse's &quot;Finite and  Infinite Games&quot; and consider it much more accessible to the person  with an average interest in this type of subject. Although I found the book  deeply spiritual in nature, I also found it well in line with fundamental  beliefs.  A Baptist minister and a Buddhist monk would both enjoy the  insights Frank Rivers presents to the reader. A great book for carrying  around and reading at those odd moments"

books,4 of 4,4.0,Review of Audio CD,"I'm writing this review of the 5-CD audiobook, not the book. The CD is a must-have, whether you've read the book or not. In it, actual examples are acted out of all kinds of conversations before and after the techniques are used. After listening to the CD I can easily recall what to do when I find myself suddenly in a difficult conversation, because i've actually heard it. Also, as you move through the sessions, the authors go just a bit deeper and deeper until one finds oneself admitting some very personal truths. I think the reviewer below who recommends Dale Carnegie instead didn't hear the CDs -- I didn't get the same result from Dale's books, as I have from listening to these CDs. The ultimate result of having listened to the series a few times? I don't get thrown off balance (their term) so often when I suddenly realize the other person is reacting negatively to what I thought was positive, and vice versa. I just switch into a different mode and many times, the person (either me or my companion) has forgotten they were upset at all."

Carl Rogers will go down in history one person who truly changed counseling and therapy"

books,3 of 3,5.0,What a great insight!,"This book has been especially useful for a university paper I was working on. It passed some time since that but the concepts I read are still fresh in my memory, since it were concepts I've been suspicious for a long time. One might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male ""impotence"", but if you take an impartial look you'll find he is right. Don't get me wrong: I have no problems in beeing a man, but I'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure, on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman, that he is not a sissy or a gay - wich is even worse -, but, on the contrary, that he is a real macho, a sex machine that can ""score"" as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence. It's sad but it's the reality."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Hemingway Western,"All the Pretty Horses is what I would imagine it would be like if Ernest Hemingway wrote a modern-day Western. Very rich language and vivid imagery, yet simple and direct dialogue. Not an especially complex plot and nothing unnecessary throughout, yet very deep emotionally. I'm eagerly making my way through the rest of the Border Trilogy and finding McCarthy a little more verbose and allegorical in The Crossing, but All the Pretty Horses has no wasted words in telling a fantastic story"

books,0 of 1,4.0,Extra Credit - Class Group Book Review,"Best selling author Daniel Goleman, who popularized a theory of emotional intelligence (EI) via his 1995 bestseller Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, has teamed up with colleague EI researchers, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee to advance a new leadership concept - Primal Leadership.  The authors focus on the four EI domains (self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management), and link them to leadership success that affected several organizations' bottom lines positively by bringing out the best in people, a concept called ""resonance"".  It is revealed that EI domains or competencies create leadership styles that reinforce resonance as well as those that create dissonance.  Drawing from a decade of the authors' collective research and the real life experience of leaders in the trenches, a connection is made where leadership demands more than conventionally recognized intelligence, but emotional intelligence as well.  The key to this is to use emotion to balance the reality of work and organization demands without unduly upsetting people to impact staff results.  In a twist, the authors find that the encouragement to use EI originates internally.  Furthermore, they offer a learning plan as a mechanism to sustain transformation rather than a performance outcome model.  In the end, the book correlates its concepts to the organization as a whole to create the desired outcome of an organization with resonance that favorably influences the bottom line of the organization"

books,7 of 7,4.0,Enjoyable and informative,"Ben-Ari has written a highly enjoyable book about the nature of science that reads quickly and easily.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone involved with teaching science (that may be a professor, secondary, or elementary school teacher).  The author takes the best, most sober points from philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science and demonstrates the implications these works have for preparing a scientifically literate public.  He clarifies troublesome definitions such as ""theory"" ""fact"" ""proof"" and ""hypothesis"".  His insights on falsification and the need for an understanding of statistics are dead-on.  I am using this book in the post-secondary courses I teach."

The idea of reality being what we're used to it being (not rather what it HAS to be everywhere), as well as the hilarity of the situation the people of the story are faced with is just delightful. It is an excellent resource of rich vocabulary and expression, and the drawings are believable and at the same time jaw dropping. Highly recommended to all ages, especially preschool through the lower grades"

books,,4.0,As Good a First Novel as First  Novels Get,"This first novel by one of modern America's prose-writing treasures is set in a part of California no one associates with the Golden State: the Sacramento Delta. The emotional and physical geography of the book blend seamlessly. Didion has since critiqued this book herself, in her much later prose reflection on California, ""Where I Was From.""  She's a bit hard on her former self. This is a lucid, hard etched short novel on the same general theme as Tolstoi's ""Anna Karenina"":  that is, how a uniquely unhappy family got that way. Didion is of an old California family. She takes no false pride in that, here or elsewhere. There is not a useless or spongy sentence in the whole book. Writers will be reminded of what they're supposed to be doing when they pick up a pen."

I'm not even sure what &quot;poor aesthetic quality&quot; means.  But if it describes the heartbreaking, iconic portrait of Johnny Cash and June Carter, then I surely want more of it.  These are beautiful, sometimes funny and often emotionally moving pictures in which the subjects collaborate with the artist to present a certain face to the world. Maybe not all the faces are completely honest ones, but they're interesting and beautifully photographed"
books,,5.0,Highly disturbing book,"When I first read this book, upon finishing it I immediately proceeded to rip it's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces. That was how much the story affected me. It disgusted me, it disturbed me, it ... moved me. After brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head, and if that's not the mark of a great writer I don't know what is. I then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again."

As a veteran middle school teacher, I have a bone to pick with the counteless boring, repetative children's biographies my students and I have endured. Finally, a biography that is engaging, interesting, human and educational. Bone Detective is a breath of fresh air in my classroom. Students love the photos that give the book a ""scrapbook"" feel. Sidebar photos and diagrams clearly explain complicated science concepts. The writing style has grabed my 6th students' attention and held it - suspenseful, humorous and thought-provoking. The forensics topic couldn't be more timely. Diane France is presented as a real human, in a real science job in a way that my students are really relating to"

books,1 of 7,1.0,Why continue to be deceived...,"Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy ""experts"" or ""scholars"" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming ""Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period"" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items)"
books,1 of 2,5.0,This is a great read!,"If you are a fan, this is a great read.  If you are not a fan, but just interested in the game, it is still a great read.  What I find most amusing are the baseball ""experts"" who poo-poo Billy Bean's approach to fielding and running a baseball team.  ""The proof of the pudding is in the eatin'"" and the cognocenti appear to dislike the taste.  The Oakland A's have been one of the stellar teams, yet, it appears that success is not what is important.  What is important is success based on the recipe that the ""experts"" write"

books,7 of 8,2.0,Dry and boring.  Could barely keep my eyes open.,"Unlike the rest of the Rich Dad books that I've read -- which were for the most part fantastic -- this book was terrible.  Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer.  The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book.  Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me.  And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical ""horror stories"" that he relays at the beginning of the book.  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down.  But I guess I could've gotten that from a dictionary too"

books,2 of 2,4.0,Enjoyable historical mystery novel,"In EMMA BROWN, author Clare Boylan takes two chapters of an unfinished novel left behind by Charlotte Bronte and turns them into a complete novel.  In doing so, she incorporates other pieces of Bronte's writing, including a short story published by her husband after her.  The result, while perhaps not what Bronte herself intended (we'll never know), is a rich, multi-layered novel that makes for an engaging read."

books,,5.0,Practical Economics,"DeSoto presents an elegant model for the creation of capital in a society.  His examples focus on the infrastructure needed for capital formation, and they are clearly presented and explained in a historical context when applicable.  In a field (economics) that is riddled with disconnected academics, DeSoto pleases the reader by presenting a model based on primary research.  The reader also will enjoy DeSoto's clever phrasings and sentence structure.  Thorough citations will aid a learner in the advanced study of the argument, while clarity and elegance in support work will please a reader considering for the first time why capitalism seems to thrive only in the West"
books,1 of 2,4.0,Great resource,It's hard to find a good resource soup-to-nuts on things like search and many configuration items.  This book does a great job of explaining quite a few items.  It's also very helpful in developing user documentation as many steps are clearly spelled out.  The CD it comes with contains quite a few very helpful web parts and utilities.  This is a must on any SharePoint admin's bookshelf

books,6 of 7,5.0,A compulsive read and an important document,"Leaving not a state or an oppression unturned, Lies Across America is the enormous, exhaustive sequel of kinds to Lies My Teacher Told Me, taking a look at the monuments and markers across America that overwhelmingly paint a dishonest and unrelentingly positive view of America's past.  What he provides here isn't just vital history, it tells the vital sociological truth about history's continued impact on regional landscapes.  Many have complained that his section of the South is too long and too anti-Confederate (it's now controversial to be anti-Confederate?).  But why it's such an important section is in representing the continued oppression and inequality of the region as part of a process of sugarcoating our history and who was disenfranchised in the process.  Plus, his points demand to be considered - never has a work so thoughtfully, credibly, and humorously elucidated the flaws and implications in the way we tell history.  Read this book with an open mind, and you'll never look the same way at our use of the word ""discovered"" (a loaded Euro-centric term that denies people living in certain areas for hundreds of years), the undertones - and occasionally overtones - that glorify racism in countless southern monuments, or the continued dialogue between how to represent historical items in a specific time and representing what actually happened.  This is a book whose importance in representing both the past and present cannot be overstated"
books,0 of 2,4.0,What's Wrong With NAFTA,"This excellent book deals mostly with the many ways in which NAFTA is ruining all the countries involved.  Although the description of the problem seems fairly accurate, the book disappoints somewhat by not mentioning some stronger cures, the strongest and most corrective of which is socialism"
books,2 of 14,4.0,Good Book,"Has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative well-written text by a good historian. That is, unless your car won't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following Monday two days before Christmas.  In that scenario, his good-historian-ness flies out the window and you just hate his guts. Taylor: Not all of us come from big money! Sorry my 80s model car exploded and inconvenienced you so! Thanks for ruining my gpa!"
books,2 of 6,1.0,Let Me Save You Some Time,"If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it"
books,2 of 4,4.0,Very Personal Look at Lincoln,"David Herbert Martin gives readers a very personal view of Lincoln.  We see that Old Abe was honest and gifted, but also calculating, ambitious, and burdened by self-doubt.  Perhaps that's normal for an introspective man who overcomes poverty, depression and tragedy.  The author maintains this very personal focus as he details Lincoln's rise from young legislative leader and one-term Congressman to national figure as visionary builder of the nascent Republican Party in the 1850's."
books,,5.0,You Will See Yourself and Your Spouse in this Book,"Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in they forgot they were from different planets. Based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus has helped millions of couples transform their relationships. Now viewed as a modern classic, this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn't arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow. Don't be too surprised when you are reading this book and you recognize someone and some situation that is eerily like your own"
books,11 of 14,4.0,The Add Answer- Read it with an open mind!,"While raising a son with ADD I have read many books and articles which seem to advocate one treatment or another. I find this book has a family centered approach. Solutions involve the family rather than the just the ADD child. And, while the book does give some intriguing alternatives to the usual medication regimes, it does not rule them out all together. I liked this book for the new ideas it presented without insisting that these are the only ones which will work. The author seems knowledgeable, has had a long practice and  includes some personal experiences to illustrate his ideas"
books,11 of 11,4.0,Forty blend shapes...,"Brilliant concepts and discussion of details, but somewhat slow in painting the big picture. He never really comes out and says it, so I will. The end result is a control rig for 40 blend shapes, each painstakingly hand drawn and tuned. The state of the art doesn't allow shortcuts; I don't think it ever can or will. If you can accept that all 40 shapes are needed to model the range of human facial expression, this book is for you. Osipa makes a compelling argument that each is necessary; guides you through the modeling to make it possible; and wraps up with an elegant rig to control and manage them all. The result is a talking head, simply amazing in its range and control of nuance. Still, 40 heads per character is a huge investment. Is it worth ""Doing Right?"" Or can you continue to fake it? Buy the book; play with the rig; and find out for yourself."

books,2 of 2,5.0,Hendricks hits a homerun - must read for every teacher,"The great Dallas Theological Seminary professor Dr. Hendricks shares with others his basic principles for passing on to his students the knowledge and passion for God's Word.  Basically the book can be boiled down to one primary principle - you must have passion for what you know to transfer what you know to others.  The book was originally released as The Seven Laws of the Teacher, but has since been repackaged and re-released under this new title with a new cover and design - but the truths shared by Hendricks are timeless and powerful - and should be read by EVERY teacher!"

Then he broke my heart a few times before the end of chapter two, and after that I just read on like a man possessed. A few bits feel plotted, but I don't care. King's novels have never been about their plots. That's news to Hollywood, I think, but not to you and me."
books,,2.0,Not Bad,"I use ""The Notebook"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.

These meals CANNOT be done in 30 minutes, unless that is if you want everything half cooked. The book makes false promises and does not deliver. There are also NO PICTURES and NO INDEX and the recipes are very confusing..most of them deriving from an original Master recipe and then just changing one or two things. If you want good food and a good cook book don't buy into the hype and don't buy this book."
books,,5.0,Excellent Piece of Work,"This is perhaps one of the best comic books or books period ever written.  It is a statement of how common life can be interesting, because we can all relate to it.  The anonymous reader who initially reviewed this obviously has either not read the aforementioned work or was too dense to understand it's deeper implications.   It is unfortunate that in the comics world stories like this don't receive as much attention as &quot;superhero&quot; comics.  For a vastly underaprecciated and misunderstood medium, this is a statement of what comics can be"

The fourth in the Kenzie/Gennaro series by Lehane, this case is not ""just"" a kidnapping on their home turf.  The pair also investigates Cheese Olamon, a Scandinavian giant they knew when they were growing up--now a drug dealer with serious underworld connections, a convict and enforcer.  Amanda's mother has been involved with Olamon and may have lucked into a $200,000 payoff meant for him, within moments of Cheese's arrest and incarceration.  No one knows what happened to the money or whether it is related to the kidnapping of Amanda."
books,5 of 7,4.0,Indispensable for studying the first Critique,"Henry Allison uses his book as a companion to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason in his courses on that work at Boston University, and well he should.  The book is dense and written for the serious student or scholar  of Kant, but it is very accessible and useful to both.  Each chapter deals  with a specific problem of Kantian idealism, moving from analysis of Kant's  presentation, through the interpretations that populate the literature on  the first critique, and finishing with Allison's own defense of Kant's  argument (or, in some cases, what he takes Kant's argument to be).  Perhaps  the most important contribution Allison makes to scholarship on the  Critique with this book is his treatment of Kant's work and his idealism as  a whole, and his persistence in keeping that whole in view even while  dissecting the minutiae of Kant's arguments; the treatment of Kantian  idealism as a doctrine lends Allison's defense a plausibility importantly  lacking in such piecemeal accounts of the Critique's immense,  sophisticated, and intricate argument as the almost useless Cambridge  Companion to Kant.  The discriminating reader will find that Allison's  defense is not always on target-he sometimes disappointingly defends Kant  from himself beyond our own ability to sympathize-but Kant's Transcendental  Idealism succeeds despite this sentimentality"

Mr. Davenport has put together a well-edited survey of knowledge workers, technology-based knowledge management and management of technology workers.  It is not terriby detailed and is not a boring academic text and it does not give you lots of program suggestions and checklists and most importantly you can come away from this with  at least a few new notions of how to manage corporate and personal knowledge and perhaps a better-based perspective of managing yourself and your subordinates."

books,7 of 7,5.0,This latest Jay offering is a must-buy,"Ricky Jay is a national treasure.  He's the head curator of a continuing collection of the curious, marginal, sometimes macabre but always compelling congregation of entertainers who have slipped through the trapdoor of time's stage.  His newest masterpiece, Extraordinary Exhibitions, is a catalogue of broadsides heralding some of the strangest performers that ever graced an auditorium or a sidewalk.  You'll meet Pietro Stadelmann, a seventeenth century armless dulcimer player.  As well as the nameless 27 year-old Angolan ""Famous African Hermaphrodite"".  And a South American trio whose huge excrescences extruding from their chins gave them their stage moniker ""The Monstrous Craws"".  You can sit at the feet of Joice Heth, the 161 year-old former nursemaid of Little Georgie Washington, the marvelous showman P. T. Barnum's first client.  There's singing mice, educated fleas and a Rabbi whose demonstrations of his prodigious memory were endorsed by the Pope himself.  To paraphrase the immortal Charles Fort, you'll see a procession of the damned of showbiz.  And thanks to the wonderful Mr. Jay, they'll walk (and bark, tumble, juggle, catch bullets, arm wrestle, rope dance and eat stones) again."
books,3 of 5,4.0,A Stunning Reality,"Although many people might question whether everything in this novel is true or not, it states on the front that it is a memoir, therefore that is how I thought of it while reading.  As far as I am concerned, everything but the names and some situations (""to protect individuals"") is the truth, and since I have not been to Tehran, I would not know any different.  I found this book captivating in most every way from the detailed descriptions of the ""girls"" in the book club to the references to other novels such as The Great Gatsby.  Although I have not read all of the books Nafisi referenced in her memoir, I still understood her story and appreciated her sharing the private (or public) moments with her readers.  I was shocked when I read about some of the laws that women (and men) must obide by in Iran, and this book sparked my interest regarding the stunning ways of the country enough from the very beginning to encourage me to look even further into the culture.  Being a secondary education English major, I would suggest this book to anyone from the age of 13 on, with hopes that he or she would read it, appreciate it, and try to gain some knowledge on a very different culture than our own while recognizing the everyday freedoms we take for granted on a daily basis."

You can also teach your dog signals for the commands you want them to do, which can come in handy if you're talking on the telephone or chatting with a friend while walking your puppy. The main idea Volhar and Fisher teach you during this book is &quot;positive reinforcement&quot;, which is a really handy training method to use. If their methods can work on my stubborn, rambunctious, sly Golden Retriever puppy, this book can definetly perform miracles with YOUR dogs!!"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Simple but brilliantly concepts,"I first became interested in this title because of the positive review by Warren Buffett. There's so much hype in the investing field that you'll save hundreds of hours of wasted time and thousands of dollars in lost money by consulting a genius to separate the wheat from the chaff. It's not always an exciting, easy read but it's essential knowledge if you're investing or planning to invest in funds. Its simple concepts that take some mental work to understand. Those that make big money in individual stock investing normally invest a tremendous amount of time understanding their field AND the particular companies they're risking their money on. If you don't have the time or inclination to do this, mutual funds are one safe way to go."

(LA is a very big place. ) And  it gives nitty-gritty secrets about each (especially the free days!) that many sites don't give.  I keep it on my desktop right along with my writing references.

books,9 of 11,5.0,Incredibly comprehensive and useful.,"This is a must-have resource item for anyone who reads, and would be incredibly useful for teachers, students, booksellers, and ANYONE who comes in contact with books.  Strouf offers info on poetry, plays, journalism,  classics, contemporary fiction and nonfiction, fables, Shakespeare,  literature references, and so much more.  It's all arranged in a perfectly  easy format and style for reading straight through, or for browsing, or for  looking up specific information on just about anything that's ever been put  into a book.  This is definitely the most useful resource tool I've come  across for understanding and enjoying the written word.  There are a few  typos that are mildly distracting, but the phenomenal wealth of information  contained in this book really make it a something that you will go back to  again and again.  Buy four copies - one for yourself, one for your  reader/friend, and especially one for any student about to enter middle  school, high school, or college.  (That's three, but I guarantee that  you'll find someone else in your life who absolutely has to have this book  once they see yours!"

I have intentionally not eaten hamburgers or hot dogs made outside of the home before this book and don't intend to have anything with ground beef that I haven't ground up myself.  This book wasn't as graphic as I expected (yes, I am disappointed.)  I have heard stories about cereal factories and tomato sauce plants so I know that basically rats are everywhere and UNWRAPPED on The Food Network won't be showing you that stuff."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Insightful and practical,"Having lived 60% of my life outside the USA in various countries, I've often been surprised at how unhappy many Americans appear to be. In the poor countries where I've lived (""third world""), people generally seem happier, friendlier, more willing to share/give and less stressed--even though they have much less (material goods, that is). Those of you who have travelled, that is, actually gotten off the beaten path, the megaresorts, the disneyfied locations, to places like the Phillipines, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, etc., have probably noted the difference."

This is a great way to teach children about African tribes, and the book also pronounces each tribe so it is easier to read. The illustrations are wonderful and full of detail. This would be a great lesson in the classroom to learn about Africa. It would also be great to use each page as a poster or transparency"

From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole."

books,2 of 4,2.0,"The first hundred pages really work, but then...","The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand"

books,3 of 3,4.0,grand deception,"one of the boldest of the bold.  kudos to mr. iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists.  nambla has been put on notice.  this is work of pure satisfaction, from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero, cat.  another worthy pile of words from mr. iles, despite his ignorance regarding black people.  the dialog is downright embarrassing, but keep trying mr. iles.  if you hang out with african-americans rather than watch them on tv, perhaps you'll get 5 stars next time"
books,9 of 9,5.0,It  Really Is,"I have found the advice in this book to be invaluable.  You simply can't go wrong.  Those looking for a book with stock/mutual fund investing howtos should keep looking however.  This is a broad brush stroke at handling one's money.  Period.  If you are going to read this book, be sure to read My Vast Fortune as well.  The two tell quite a story and show that Mr Tobias is not just blowing air between his gums.  This book is eminently readable and there is just not much wrong with it.  Everything from what to do if you inherit wealth, to what type of life insurance to buy, to how to buy a car, to how to use the internet to save money on staying at a hotel are covered, as well as everything in between.  Read this and prosper"
books,7 of 7,5.0,This book pays for itself,"If you read and follow the principles in this book you will make enough money on your trades to pay for this book many times over. I have been active in the market for years (Averaging &lt;20% return a year) and I agree with this author completely having lived out the greed, fear, and mistakes he talks about.Read this book and save yourself a lot of unnecessary losses."

books,5 of 7,5.0,The Stupid Party,"This book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking. It is not very difficult to go online and read any number of Conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day. But, this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of Conservative intellectuals. Often times it is portrayed (not without some merit) that Conservatives are anti-intellectual. I have frequently heard that Liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual. But, The Conservative Mind blows a hole through all of that. Kirk examines major Conservative thinkers like: Edmund Burke, John Adams, George Canning, Benjamin Disraeli, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, and T. S Eliot (amung many many others)."

books,9 of 9,4.0,design flaw,"It seems a little presumptuous to comment on this classic, but it would be much easier to use if the section numbers were given at the top of the pages (like keywords in a dictionary). Since every reference in the index is by section number, the page numbers emphasized in the current design are extremely distracting. There is no way to find a section number except by scanning the text. I hope the publisher will read this review and change the design in a future edition"

Read The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases In A World Out Of Balance by Laurie Garrett.  A friend loaned me his copy of this book after I had read a book about the flu epidemic in the early 1900's.  This book, written in 1994, covers a number of diseases from all over the world, as well as the stories of the individuals who constantly risk their lives to combat the deadly viruses."

They ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book.

Check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read"
books,4 of 4,4.0,"""The Bone Lady""","I found this book to be very interesting and an enjoyable, light read. As a real life CSI with an interest in skeletal remains, I am very much interested in forensic related books, both fiction and non-fiction. I had skipped the first chapter, which is an autobiography, wanting to get to the meat of the anthopology cases, but found myself developing an interest in the modest, likeable author. Halfway through the book, I went back and read the first chapter."

books,16 of 20,5.0,Timeless guide to public speaking,"I regularly give public talks, and am always looking for ways to improve my speaking and organizational abilities. On a lark, I picked this up from a friend's bookshelf, and simply couldn't put it down, eventually buying my own copy. It isn't only that the author offers highly useful, practical information regarding poise, confidence, and organization, but also writes with a level of skill that is truly rare. I recommend this book not only to burgeoning and expert public speakers alike, but also to writers interested in reading truly masterful prose"
books,7 of 8,4.0,Complex and Reavealing But Not Polemical,"Far from reducing the Islamic Republic of Iran to some kind of timeless expression of Islamic culture, tradition, or identity, the author demonstrates the competing ideological influences that shaped the Islamic Republic -- not least of which were Western notions of political particpation. The author does a good job of showing how these tensions are reflected in the reform movement, and in the struggle for power currently unfolding in Iran. Thus I found the book very useful. I would only add that the author may have given insufficient attention to the power of the conservative clerics"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Hillerman is consistently good...,"I love the southwest having grown up in Salt Lake City, California, and visiting my grandparents in Mesa, Arizona. Hillerman has created his own unique genre...because there is no one who deals with Native americans and their own problems. This book especially was good because a few years ago they had many young people die from the Hantavirus (Hillerman adds the bubonic plague...but the Hantavirus is the main concern down there. With too much water, the pinion trees produce too muchand encourages the population growth of mice and rats who live under the homes of the Native Americans. When their fecal matter dries out, it aerosolizes and exposes the lungs to the virus in the fecal matter. the Center for Disease control had their hands full with that one."
books,21 of 22,5.0,Excllent,"David Eller writes with wit and passion. ""Passion"" is not a word applied by so-called mainstreamers to Atheists, since they are supposed to be feckless and ignorant.

books,30 of 32,5.0,Toss Your Skyhooks or Tiptoe Away From Dennett's Book,"In the early 90's, Dennett taught a seminar on Darwin & Philosophy - most of that college course is in this book.  With this 500-plus page persuasive treatise, Dennett examines every corner of evolutionary theory.  Some aspects of evolutionary theory are established beyond any reasonable scientific doubt - other fine points are argued within scientific circles.  Within this book all of the above are discussed in detail and Dennett takes on all arguments. In every case, Dennett leads us to conclude that, in biology, nothing makes sense outside the theory of evolution.  New discoveries may lead to shifts in the basic theory, but the hope that it will be ""refuted"" by some earthshaking breakthrough is about as likely as the hope that we will return to the idea that the sun revolves around the earth."

books,4 of 4,5.0,"A story for all fathers and sons, coaches and athletes","I'm fortunate enough to live in the Baltimore area and have heard Joe Ehrmann speak and preach. Knowing he is a thoroughly captivating speaker, I was eager to see if the book would stand up on its own.  It more than does -- Jeffrey Marx is an extremely talented and gifted author and captures not only the detail of the story, but also puts into words the emotions of his own journey.  The book takes you on a season-long journey with a high school football team and how they are taught to love one another, first and foremost.  I was extremely curious how this would be taught within the physicality of football.  This is a must read for all coaches, regardless of sport.  I have been able to discuss some of the principles in the book with my 8 year old son and 7 year old daughter and I can already see the change in their thinking and behaviors."

books,5 of 8,5.0,The Last Masterpiece,"WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of ""high art."" The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms."
books,4 of 5,4.0,An Empire or Liberty?  Depends on Your Perspective,"Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's ""American Colonies"" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do.  This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Lost in Translation,"The short novel Night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter, but because Elie Wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character.  Generally considered autobiographical, the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only God, but his humanity as the Nazi machine ravages Europe.  The novel itself deserves 10 stars."

books,2 of 2,5.0,"The Making of the American Musical, by Patricia J. Brown, Esq., Fresno, CA","I loved this book. Ever since my high school English teacher chastised me for trying to put Miller's The Crucible in the context of the McCarthy era, I have been fascinated with the social context surrounding the creation of art. Jones focuses on the political as well as social context that has given birth to the great...and the mediocre...of the American musical. First, his use of terms such as ""diversionary"" ring so true for those of us who love mindless fluff when we go to the theatre. Second, I was shocked at how little I had appreciated the contributions of African-Americans, inter alia, to the American stage prior to reading this book. But, mostly, I liked how he articulated how a writer's gestalt accounts for the end product on the stage and his description of how copy-cat musicals come into being. The book gave me the backstory to many of the original shows I had the good fortune to see on Broadway. I, for one, would love a Volume II of this book to be Jones' next foray. I especially offer this to aspiring young actors, writers, directors and songwriters as a required read before embarking on a life in musical theater. If you want to create art, you must know from whence you came"

Im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market.  Unless you have big bucks and Level II quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky. In the trading parlance, I wish I had a short position on this book at its current price, and could cover my short at the current used price! Save your money"

To take a bold step forward and reveal to the world who you really are."
books,1 of 4,5.0,Fantastic book,"This is a perfect example of edutainment at its best.  Terrfic fun while simultaneously teaching you a great deal about the key factors that determine a teams win rate.  Aside from the style and the analysis this book also does something even more valuable: It highlights a management approach that is truly based on merit, as opposed to how ""pretty"" an athelete is or how much charisma they have.  For people who believe that the USA is as close as any country to being a meritocracy - this book is a shining example of just that.  I am truly astonished and dismayed by the negative reviews I have read.  I can't wait for Lewis to write his next book."

books,4 of 5,5.0,Fields of Gold,"From page one to the last, I was drawn into not only the story, but each character.  This is a sensory exploration into the life of young, innocent woman and her will to overcome adversity.  The descriptive writing permits one to enter into each scene and become emotionally and physically enveloped.  By combining a fictional character with one of historical significance, Marie Bostwick provides readers with the desire to pursue the question 'what if?'.  This book is difficult to put down, inspirational and left me wanting more."
books,,1.0,Not Another Great Read,"I read the works of folks like Vince Flynn, Lee Child, and, I thought, Nelson DeMille, for the escape--the action--intrigue. Someting to make the plane flight go faster.  I don't read for thinly-veiled, current-events, quasi-political commentary.  (There are recognized exports available for that sort of thing.  For example, a tour-of-duty in Vietnam gives neither me, nor Nelson, ""expert"" status on the conduct of warfare.)"
books,10 of 14,5.0,Antidote Against Brainwash!,"Daniel Flynn does a great job exposing the knee-jerk, brain-dead, and all together perspective-free anti-Americanism that pervades contemporary intelligentsia.  He starts with a large series of anecdotes that followed 9-11.  They consist of mainly stories and quotes from college profs, students, and protesters who blame ""Amerika"" for the death of nearly 3,000 Americans that day."

Just a few days ago, I was sluggish, and depressed after going on Jenny Craig and failing at it.  I went on Jenny Craig at age 16 and was uncannily successful, almost 10 years later, I decided to try it again, but to no avail.

books,1 of 2,5.0,We've all been there,"Sharp,and witty while at the same time casting a warm and gentle gaze at the daily trials and tribulations of our baby-boomer generation, James Atlas captures the essence of what it means to reach that defining decade. His chapters speak to those of us whose parents are aging and whose children have left the nest; those of us who think of ourselves as successful until we face the reality of the New York real estate market as we attempt to downsize and divest ourselves of the ""suburban"" mini-estates where we raised our children. I laughed out loud,while calling out to my husband ""He's talking about us."
books,2 of 2,5.0,"Rich, fascinating, and intensely rewarding, a stunning and easy read","Fabulous, sumptuous, and superb. This is one complex, twisted, literary-type book that is also fascinating and intensely readable. I often start reading books of this genre with a sense of trepidation, because however good they are, they're also so often dense and maze-like with the vividness of the characters and plot bogged down in the author's strivings for intellectual/pyschological depth, with the result that the reader is always kept at a distance, struggling like a drowning man to feel empathy for the characters and to actually WANT to continue reading. This book is different-it flows along with an unselfconscious and almost effortless ease, establishing the characters as empathetic human people in our minds and moving the plot along without unnecessary jargon, while at the same time layering it with a rich tapestry of words, details, and emotions, so that the past and the present pictured in the novel weave together and reflect on each other. I was stunned and carried along by the ease with which one sentence flows into the next, and riveted by the characters and the passion of the world I found myself in. Once in a long while I find a book in which I can actually feel my brain expanding at the depth and stunning simplicity of the author's vision. This is one of them-read it. It's passionate and lyrical, rich and wonderful"

books,5 of 5,4.0,Excellent Read,"Nakken's book provides a clear and comprehensive description of the main aspects of the addicted person.  He discusses the stages of addiction, Society and addiction, family and addiction, and recovery.  this book is definitely a useful read for those intereste in understanding addiction and what is actually going on within the addicted individual.  However, we must always remember that people are unique and each case is individualized, thus these are generalizations and may not perfectly fit all who are addicted.  The most imporatnt thing to realize is addiction is a disease and there is treatment.  Highly recommended book"
books,8 of 19,1.0,Scaremongering and inaccurate,"This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a ""don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you"" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby."

books,,5.0,Early American historical personalities and relationships,"This book was eye opening for me to apply personalities and personal relationships between Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton and of course Adams among others. The vibrant times of enlightened thought in the formation of the country with the Declaration of Independence then in the midst of war and politics and thereafter the early years of forming the Constitution and the political infighting was very interesting. These were passionate men who lived in an incedible time. I never had seen these founding fathers as real people before this book."

books,7 of 7,5.0,dare to expose yourself,"After becoming thoroughly jaded by the 'standard social science model', and the brow beating of religion, this book was a near epiphany for myself.  The writing is crisp, witty, lucid, and provocative.  I contented myself with how he substantiated his research, albeit there is a sense of having completely arrived with a comprhensive overview of the human mind and subsequent behavior.  I'm sure there is more to be discovered and scrutinized, but the genie is out of the bottle now, and one is compelled to relentlessly and tenaciously pursue this endeavor after reading this book.  Pinker will bring you under this compulsion, if not absolutely convincingly but if only to fan the flames of inquiry.  Dare to read, dare to change, dare to think.  For some, Pinker will open up a 'Pandora's box', but he will leave you with a cautious optimism as well.  This read will stike you like Dorothy stepping into color for the first time.  This book is now permanently shelved for future reference, which is very telling, because I simply can't say that about the vast majority of material I've read to this date"
books,2 of 4,4.0,Barely Unbeatable Theory,"Freud's &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory"
books,1 of 3,2.0,Lengthy Writing,I picked up this book after seeing some good reviews about it.
books,0 of 1,5.0,Outstanding,"Simply outstanding.  McCullough brings history alive.  It's not ""history,"" it's a real story.  It may not be perfect historically, but it's pretty darn good.  And there is no such thing as ""perfect"" anyway when it comes to history.  It is perfect, however, when it comes to conveying - it's vivid, it's fully understandable, it's exciting, and it's not hyped because history at that period of time and the life and role of Adams was so exciting.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it"
books,8 of 10,5.0,Mind and heart opening genius!,"The Attractor Factor gives you much more than just a simple formula for acheiving success in your life.  Whatever you want out of life, whether it is love, wealth or fame, it requires an effort on your part and a paradigm shift in your thoughts and beliefs.  Because so many people have negative beliefs (whether they realize it or not) they ""attract"" negative manifestations into their lives.  By changing your thoughts and beliefs, your actions - and the resulting manifestations - will follow."
books,,4.0,Very Interesting,"The book was very interesting (especailly since I am currently studying criminal justice and forensic science).  I found the short stories to be very convenient in allowing me to pick up the book and put it down again with my busy schedule.  However, I must admit the numerous spelling errors did get on my nerves.  Overall the content was good and I would say the book was worth the read"
books,18 of 18,5.0,Fascinating and thought-provoking,"The Decline of the West is the magnum opus of Oswald Spengler (1880-1936), a German historian and philosopher. In it, Spengler rejects the idea that the future of the West (or indeed of any culture) is an open-ended advance from the primitive past to an ever more glorious and expansive future. Instead, cultures (including the West) experience an almost organic history of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter."

The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.

I read this book in a day and will definitely put it in my daughter's ""must read"" pile when she is ready for it.  This is one of those books that, when you read it, it forever changes your life.  Atleast it did for me...the same way TKAM changed me and has stayed with me.  I highly recommend this book"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent Book,"I was impressed by this book.  I struggle with casseroles, but long workdays necessitate the need for me to master them.  If you are familiar with Cook's Illustrated, there's nothing new here in terms of format.  I do applaud them for approaching casseroles in a new way by including one-pot meals, slow-cooker meals, skillet versions and more exotic casseroles."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Camel Urine and Dead Locusts/Stockholm Syndrome,"THe food items listed above are just a few of the treats and libations the survivors of the shipwreck of the Commerce had to eat in their lengthy forced trek across the Sahara DEsert in the 1800's. They also endured slavery, starvation, intense heat and thirst, and the strange customs of their captors. But like any good adventure/survival story, the suffering of the participants is only part of the picture. THIs book's vivid  portrayal of life in the Sahara and the communistic principles of the Bedouins that live there is riveting reading. By the end of the book one is sympathetic to both the sufferings of the captives and the shifting loyalties of their Muslim captors. Indeed, both the reader and the sailors become victims of the Stockholm Syndrome, whereby one becomes sympathetic to the plight of your captor, despite your own travails."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Presents creation of human life as a wonder granted by God,"The Amazing Beginning Of You is a straightforward introduction to the young reader about the miracles of conception, pregnancy, and birth from a Christian perspective. Color photographs reveal the incredible process of maturing from a zygote to a baby about to be born. The act of insemination (and human sexuality per se), is not explained or detailed in The Amazing Beginning Of You, which only briefly alludes to the role of the father in providing sperm. The focus is on presenting the creation of human life as a wonder granted by God. The Amazing Beginning Of You is an excellent and recommended book for Christian parents to answer the question: ""Where do babies come from?"
books,12 of 12,5.0,One of the great books on the American Revolution,"Long before there were bloggers and political pundits there were the pamphleteers.  Bernard Bailyn shows just how important pamphleteering was in getting the message out.  Take Tom Paine's Common Sense for instance.  More than 200,000 copies were distributed throughout the colonies, making it a runaway bestseller in its day.  He championed universal suffrage, the unicameral legislature and a clean break from England.  He was countered by John Adams, who, in Thoughts on Government, felt a more prudent course was in order.  Bailyn gleens from these famous pamphlets and many others and presenting a very compelling history of the American Revolution.  It was a revolution in thought as well as government, that eventually saw Adams' Federalist ideas seize the upper hand.  But, Pennsylvania initially adopted many of Paine's ideas, creating the only unicameral legislature in the United States, and extending voting rights to most men."

books,9 of 10,5.0,The Truth,"I found this book  to be one of the most life changings books I have read todate. The author gives you a really clear path that makes you focus on your life and you as a person. The insight that I have gained about myself was really freeing. I read the book through once and then I started all over again with Chapter One. I got a journal and I have begun writing, meditating on the scriptures from the book and really learning how to connect my poor eating habits to the stressful or negative events that occur in my life. I will be using this book for the next few years. This book can really be applied to any addiction that a person may be dealing with."
books,2 of 5,5.0,WONDERFUL,"THIS MAY BE MY SECOND FAVORITE BILL BRYSON BOOK BEHIND SUNBURNED COUNTRY. AS I SAID IN HIS FORUM, IT'S BEYOND BELIEF THAT HE AND HIS OVERWEIGHT FRIEND GOOD OLD KATZ WALKED AS FAR AS THEY DID IN THE WILDERNESS AND SURVIVED. IT IS A WONDERFUL, RELAXING, EDIFYING, LAUGH-RIOT OF A BOOK AS ONLY BILL CAN PROVIDE. I LOVE HIS WORK AND TRUST ME, BUY THIS, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN. EVEN READING ABOUT THE DANGERS YOU'LL FEEL LIKE IMMEDIATELY GOING FOR A HIKE SOMEWHERE. ONE WARNING, TAKE A LOT OF BILL'S HISTORY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. HE TENDS TO BEND THE FACTS A BIT FOR A LAUGH AND HIS ""HISTORY"" OF THOMAS J. JACKSON (STONEWALL) IS JUST NONSENSE, BUT VERY FUNNY. IN FACT, JACKSON WAS PROBABLY THE MOST BRILLIANT MAJOR OFFICER THE UNITED STATES EVER PRODUCED AND HE, NOT ROBERT E. LEE WAS THE STATEGIST IN THE SOUTH'S GREATEST VICTORIES. BUT I DIGRESS, BILL BRYSON IS MY HERO AND FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I'M A REPUBLICAN AND HE DETESTS REPUBLICAN'S SO YOU KNOW I FIND THIS MAN FUNNY. GO BILL"
books,4 of 6,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyable,"A latticework of tales within tales, ranging from Gothic horror, to comedy, to Arabian Night style adventures. The horror element is more pronounced at the beginning of the novel, and the loose ends are tied up rather too rapidly at the end, but the tales themselves are so well written that they carry you along by their own strengths. If you are looking for a simple linear narrative, beware. The novel skips from tale to tale, and characters within tales often tell their own stories, so it can be demanding of the reader's memory. In that sense, the structure is more akin to the time and place shifts used by some modern novelists. The reader's patience is rewarded by a work far superior than Boccaccio, and much better than anything produced by Lawrence Norfolk"
books,3 of 3,5.0,"Finally, a great guide to managing thousands of photos","One of the most difficult realities of managing thousands of digital photo images is how to label them in a consitent manner so that you can easily retrieve photos and keep track of photos that have been altered. Another important consideration is if you will be able to read the information as software and hardware changes occur. Peter Krogh makes logical suggestions and tells you why he chose to label an image in a particular manner. The DAM Book also has great suggestions on backing up photos. I have always struggled with labeling/numbering consistency, Peter Krogh makes it all very logical"
books,12 of 12,5.0,A &quot;must-read&quot; book for arthritis sufferers,"Barbara Allan's story of how she regained her health is truly inspiring.  Every time I read it, I find another bit of information that I can try or pass on to my mother who has severe osteoarthritis.  We found the chapters on exercise and diet particularly helpful to us both. Ms. Allan has provided a well-researched and clearly written book that should be read by all those suffering from severe arthritis as well as those who are experiencing some of the early symptoms.  Thank you, Barbara"
books,5 of 5,5.0,An Inspiring American Story,"John McCain's autobiography is a stirring account of perseverance and family values that is ultimately a tribute to the will of humanity to prevail. If only more fathers would give their sons the lessons that John Sr. instilled in John, our world would be a better place. If only more men had the unwavering self-confidence that John had as a POW, we could all live inspired. John McCain shows us that we can grow as people if we learn to do what's right in the end. After all, he wasn't perfect, but he learned to hold his head high and make his life as perfect as it could be with what he had. Outstanding, altogether"
books,,2.0,Nothing New,"Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of ""the road to 9/11.""  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the ""friend and enemy"" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a ""state of exemption.""  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, ""The Power of Nightmares"" or ""From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism"" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about ""the road to 9/11,"" check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel ""Mission Accomplished."
books,0 of 1,5.0,Valuable Insights,"Polk's useful analysis of Iraq history brims with insights into what is happening in Iraq today.

books,4 of 7,4.0,A Morality Play with a Double Entendre Title,"If you have not yet read The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley Under Ground (the weakest of the three first books in the series), I strongly suggest that you pursue those books before Ripley's Game.

OK, lawyers aren't interesting but Grisham sure makes them seem interesting and his book does a great job of tying together a wealthy, spoiled family to a single woman living in Brazil working as a missionary."
books,13 of 15,5.0,Before you get in trouble - read this book,This book is excellent! It tells you the ins and outs of how credit cards work and how to use them to your advantage. It explains how to use them wisely and dispells many of the myths that so many people still believe about credit. It gives you in very simple terms the ability to compare different credit offers. The easy to use tables in the back of the book help you figure out if an offer will help or hurt you in the long run and how long it will take to pay off accounts. I also took the advice of getting a credit report. So much on there from the past that didn't need to be there that wasn't helping my rating
books,2 of 2,5.0,It's all about the boom,"I taught preschool for years and now have a 6 month old.  I have read Chicka Chicka so many times that I can quote it verbatim from the first ""A"" to the last ""Boom"".  The thing about this book is how easy it is to make it exciting and fun for the listener. Anyone who teaches knows that reading to kids is almost as much about the acting as it is about the words and the pictures.  This book lends itself so easily to sign language, volume changes (BOOM BOOM!), tempo changes, humor, and body movements...if you're not willing to twist yourself ""ally-oop"" like ""O"", you may not grasp its greatness.  If you are, your listeners will be hooked on Chicka"
books,4 of 4,4.0,eye opener,"Most people with an interest in history probably  think they know quite a bit about Hitler's Germany. This book reveals quite a bit of new information and fills in the details in a picture more often described in broad brush strokes. The writing can be quite dry, and may contain too much detail (figures) for some readers but it is generally a readable yet credible book"

I can't wait for Mr. Patterson's next version of life as only Max knows it"
books,4 of 4,5.0,I Loved It,"The book was everything I expected. The story was great and the characters developed the whole way to the end. Action, suspence and a happy ending. Not all King books have a happy ending but I'm glad this one did."
books,6 of 7,2.0,I was very disappointed....,"Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of ""My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this...""  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author."
books,5 of 7,5.0,How true!!,"Reading this, you understand how John Stossel had the scales fall from his eyes and he began to question, rather than just accept. This seems to be a rare characteristic in a journalist today. Well written, you will also find yourself wanting to look a little closer to the facts of a story"

books,3 of 3,4.0,Less stress & more comtemplation,"As many people did, I received a copy of ""Simple Abundance"" as a Christmas present when it was discussed on the Oprah Show a few years ago.  That New Year, I started reading the daily entries.  For the next few years, my New Year's resolution was to daily read the appropriate daily entry.  Even though I looked forward to reading the thoughtful observations, I never seemd to make it through January without missing a day.  Last year, I saw Gail Kasper on TV talking about failed New Year's resolutions and got a copy of her ""Make A Decision To Win"" CD.  Gail Kasper's personal experience, her systematic approach and workbook have shown me how to have a less stressed-filled life.  I now find the time for reflection and am on my way, as Sarah Ban Breathnach says, ""to find the authentic life we were born to live.""  I'm ordering both products to give as a present"
books,0 of 4,1.0,Not Funny,"I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Lots of suspects,"Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone is back again in this fourth installment of Sue Grafton's alphabet series.  This time she is offered a fee to give a $25,000 cashier's check to a young man named Tony Gahan.  The check for the fee bounces and Kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her, plus the young man she is to give the cashier's check to.  Everything she finds out about her client is bad.  He is a drunk, who has killed several people in a car wreck, and appears to be a bigamist.  When he is found dead, Kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives.  This book is written in Grafton's usual breezy style, and Kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book.  I would recommend the whole series to mystery-lovers"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic book!,"I use this book as a reference guide for my high school American History and African American Studies classes. Everything in the world seems to be here including an old favorite from the 1960s, 'Puree Mongole.' This cookbook is easy to read and most recipes are simple to follow. The best part for me, as a Social Studies teacher, is the gem of the history lessons and time lines associated with all the food preparations. A real pleasure and a book that is priceless if you like the history of American cuisine"

books,15 of 15,5.0,The absolute champion of motivational books!!!,"After graduating from college I questioned my education.  I guess I wasn't happy with the path that I chose.  Too bad that I realized that right after I graduated, however just by chance I read Michael Gerber's The E Myth Revisited.  The book completely geared me towards a different goal.  Instead of going into education I decided to pursue the idea of starting my own business.  That's when I decided to research books about success and what it takes.  I stumbled upon Think and Grow Rich, I read all the reviews on Amazon.com, and instead of buying the book I decided to rent a copy from the library.  I took few days to read it.  Right after I finished reading it, I decided to purchase my own copy.  It was possibly the most important decision I've made in my life.  I'd like to claim that the book changed my life, in addition I read several other books written by Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, Jeff Keller and many more.  However, I found that Think and Grow Rich served as a template to everyone else's work. Napoleon Hill presented his discoveries quite clearly, and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone's life.  Ever since then, I've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of St. Louis.  I'm proud to say that I couldn't have done it without the help of Napoleon Hill and his book Think and Grow Rich.  This book was not only written to get rich, but also to change people in a positive way.  Whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete, this book will definitely help you achieve any goals.  Like Napoleon Hill said, ""Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve,"" these are the words to live by!  This book should be your starting point towards life's riches, you can then follow up by reading Napoleon Hill's other books, as well as books written by other authors on the same topic"

books,3 of 3,5.0,A Great Place To Start,"To start off, I am the author of the book so take the ""star review"" for what it is.  I just wanted to give you a little more depth to what this book is about in case you are looking at purchasing it.  First I will tell you that I've had over 12 years experience of not only performing improv and owning a troupe, but I've been very lucky to teach improv to people of all ages and walks of life.  I will be up front with my statement that no ONE person can teach you everything about improv.  I learned from many people and took what I liked to form my style and beliefs. It is that style that is in my book and I encourage you to look at several books if you are really serious about it."

books,1 of 2,4.0,Good but predictable,"This was of course a good read, as most all of the 'In Death' books are.  I very much liked the two mysteries that Eve had to solve (the murders and the missing person).  So glad Mavis finally had her baby.  Not a lot of character development...when will something different happen to Eve and Roarke? We need a bit of a toss up with them.  I am a loyal fan and will wait eagerly for the next one"
books,10 of 18,5.0,Hate Is Indeed The Right Word,"There is so much anti-American sentiment worldwide that one is not surprised to find that these strident deniers of all worthwhile things traditionally American are often of the homegrown variety.  In WHY THE LEFT HATES AMERICA, Daniel J. Flynn takes the Left to task as he analyzes who they are, why they think the way they do, and what the Right can say to refute the Left's most egregious charges.  Flynn places current vitriolic hatred of America within an historical context.  He notes that those who shout the loudest are often the same ones who in the mid 1960s stormed the ivy citadels of Columbia University in their protest against the Vietnam War.  Those bearded radicals upset far more than the placid decorum of a few harried college administrators.  Over the next few decades they became the new generation of administrators and teachers.  They wrote books revamping history, taught a brand of history that focused only on America's acknowledged blighted past and carefully overlooked an unacknowledged glory filled record of achievement.  Flynn notes that the trend toward anti-American thought began with the early Communist converts of this country in the mid 1920s. It was not difficult for these converts to attract the leaders of a series of oppressed minorities to their cause: W. E. B.  DuBois, Paul Robeson, and Lincoln Steffens. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the race toward finishing the job begun by DuBois, Robeson, and Steffens accelerated.  I seem to recall that it was only then that I began to read about a new source of blame America first; the Frankfurt School of Max Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, and Georg Lukacs revamped their then debunked Critical Theory to criticize American culture from top to bottom.  Flynn does a thorough job of connecting the ideological dots between the early Communists, the later neo-Communists, and the born again Critical Theorists, all of whom made it clear that in the contest between literal truth and inflexible ideology it must be the latter that had to triumph.  In fact, a central tenet of Flynn's book is that nearly all of those who shout out that the United States is to blame for all of the world's real and imagined ills share the common belief that any rumor or discredited theory that vindicates their core beliefs must be accepted as literal truth, regardless of hard evidence to the contrary.  The reverse is also true; any proven fact that contradicts their core beliefs is either conveniently ignored or-what can only be seen as a colossal gall-that such evidence is admitted to be true but still does not discredit those beliefs."
books,2 of 6,5.0,Great Marxist parody of US History,"This was absolutely the funniest parody I have ever read. The eager repetition of ""The Supremem Court interpreted the 14th Amendment to give civil rights to Corporations"" as the SINGLE WORST argument to ever come forth from that body was one of the funniest lietmotif's in this hysterical parody of US History told from the standpoint of an over-the-top Marxist. Worse than cowboys were BUSINESSMEN!! Eugene Debs and WEB Dubois were the ONLY white americans who were not evil!"

books,8 of 9,5.0,Great Reference for Pet Dog Families,"""Paws to Consider"" is an invaluable reference for the average pet dog owner who's looking to expand the family. The breed descriptions are concise and direct, and for my money, right on point most of the time. As a professional dog trainer and canine rescue volunteer, I see far too many dogs selected for their looks, or perhaps what a similar dog appeared to be on television or the movies. In the past, most folks only had the ""breed books"" to use as a reference when trying to make a selection; unfortunately, most breed books are not going to be too forthcoming about a breed's drawbacks as a family pet (when most of those characteristics were specifically put there as the breed was developed, for a specific purpose!) Thanks to Brian and Sarah for putting the real deal out there and providing a road map for the average family pet owner when navigating the windy road of breed selection!"

It just amazes me the chemistry between Luke and Roxanne.  Everytime I read it I can't get over the excitement and the smile it brings to me as they barb back and forth.  It's just an amazing story over the course of growing up together and how it all develops.  Roxanne is smart and sassy and Luke is just too cool.  This romantic duo shines and no one else compares to them yet for me.  My very favorite romance
books,13 of 13,5.0,What a time it was and what a fine book to bring it alive for us once again,"What an exciting and most interesting book!  Carol Oja takes us back to a transitional period in the cultural history of New York City (and America); the 1920s.  It isn't that book doesn't talk about anything outside of those years, but that the stuff before leads into that decade and the stuff after discusses how it flowed from those times.  Probably the best place to start reading this book is the fascinating Appendix that lists the programs of Modern Music Societies in New York from 1920-31.  It gives you a flavor for the decade and the material the book is going to cover."
books,1 of 14,1.0,Bloody Awful,"When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey."
books,1 of 1,4.0,"Fine Overview of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, But Rambles, Instead of Electrifies","Geologist turned journalist Simon Winchester is carving out his own fine niche in popular science writing, of which ""A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906"" is a very good example. However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books ""Krakatoa"" and ""The Map That Changed The World"". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (""From Plate to Shining Plate""), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his ""Annals of the Former World"".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name. However, if you are interested in a sprawling, occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake, then ""A Crack in the Edge of the World"" may indeed be of interest to you, the potential customer and reader"

books,9 of 9,5.0,Better than previous editions,"Outside of a few typos, I found the 2005 edition of NFT Chicago to be more useful than past ones (which were also useful). The main thing is, there's a lot more maps. Instead of just having central Chicago covered, it goes all the way to the city's borders, so it's great when I have to go way south or way west, or other areas I don't venture in very much. Also, it seems like thier arts listings are more comprehensive, and there's a huge new section about what to do with kids (although it seems to be targeted to the nanny-set). Still, it's an invaluable refernce to have in your car, or to hand off to guests if you have to leave them to thier own devices"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Leave the Penguin in the Antarctic,"In its 1,201 pages, this book expresses maybe 25,000 opinions. And its unavoidable omissions silently state uncountable thousands more. So even a near-dilettante like myself will have no trouble carping over some of them. But when it takes a position significantly outside the consensus, it usually says so up front. And you won't have to waste any mental energy deciding how much of an adjustment to make for Penguin's notorious ""Britannia rules the audio-waves"" bias. But most decisively for me, it's simply a great deal more enjoyable to peruse. Part of that is the cleaner layout, but mostly it's the writing - concise, informative, and frank."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Windy City,"Only one other city is so steaped in architecture history than Chicago and this guide does a commendable job of highlighting the most important Chicago buildings, the synopsis on each building is susinct, the only qualm I have is that there are not more pictures, I also wish the authors had ventured more into the suburbs and commented on some of the great houses in Lake Forest and Highland Park, but that omission does not mar the overall enjoyment of this scholarly guide.  If you are interested in architecture at all, I recommend you pick up this book, Chicago is so steaped in architecture history and this is a good guide to the best examples."
books,7 of 21,1.0,GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY INSTEAD!,"I sure am glad I did not waste my money on this book. The author had very few good things to say about any of the breeds. This book had so little information on my breed of choice, though it was seen on the cover, that it was a total waste of my time. It almost seemed as though the book was written to turn people off to getting any type of dog at all! Lots of negatives about the breeds, not alot of positives. Alot of generalizations"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Warning to Those in Love with Unbridled Power and Vulnerable to Anything New,Edmund Burke (1729-1797)wrote REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE in 1789 which was four years before the rise of the fanatical Jacobins and the execution (murder)of Louis XVI.  This book was not only well written but very prophetic on the tragic events that were part of the French Revolution.  Burke showed historical insight and warned both the British and the French what was going to happen.
books,1 of 2,5.0,terrific romantic fantasy,"In 1215 in the Kingdom of Lochalyn, Thorgir murders his brother the king, kills his nephews except the youngest prince Rhys, and when his sister in law Queen Caitrin refuses to cooperate, he slays her too; none are buried properly.  He completes his dastardly coup by having a surgeon insure that Rhys would never have whelps and he would qualify as a singer with the Virgins of the Goddess."
books,17 of 47,5.0,Wonderful stuff,"Remember what happened to Tom Paine ?  Crucial to the Revolution. Discovered corruption in Congress.  Was hounded out of the country.  They were wise to be worried.  And so was the South. There is a stronger case for States Rights today than ever before.  The European Union offers a model of a federation of sovereign states whose central government only controls common interests and doesn't interfere in direct taxation or local law, but by importing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (itself based on Paine's Rights of Man) into law it gives certain guarantees which have hardly been mentioned in the US (prisoners' rights for instance).  Equally the Canadian constitution is a good model for a modern constitution (it includes the rights of women!).  These guys could see the problems.  How do we get our 'representatives' to see the problem ?  By turning the US Constitution into a kind of holy document, we actually work against the ideas of the people who first conceived it.  This book is an excellent one to give those 'constitutionalists' who would rather not think for themselves"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Brilliant!,It's a crime novel. It's human drama. It's gritty eloquent and literary. There are few other writers to whom to compare Lehane.

I was really touched by the theme of inner strength and hidden strength.  The devolopment of the characters has grace and beauty to it.  The idea that beauty is not on the outside, but on the inside is an important theme in literature.  I would recommend this book to any person who wants to think about the meaning of life and the values we place on beauty and accomplishment in the world"
books,8 of 9,4.0,A good read but not very comprehensive,"The author is definately very qualified to write this book. He generally keeps the reader engrossed as he creates the backdrop and context for each of the fairs. Unfortunately, he doesnt go very in depth into any particular fair, and the reader is left craving more photos. The author frequently boasts about his extensive collection of memorabilia, but too little is shown. Its enjoyable for a quick read, but if you are interested in more in depth knowledge and imagery, you should investigate one of the more comprehensive books"
books,11 of 19,1.0,Ruined my life.,"I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Covers the Gamut Without Seeming Formulaic,"""Life Guard"" satisfied my desire to be entertained as well as to stimulate my intellect.  This novel really does cover the gamut:  exhilarating action, stunning twists, genuine love, beautiful settings, ethical dilemmas, desire for riches, mysterious murders, detective investigations, false accusations, and self vindication.  Yet somehow, it emerges as neither contrived nor unbelievable."
books,15 of 16,2.0,extended autobiography,"90% of this book is about Kim and her husband and how they got to where they are. There is very little information on how to actually go about investing. She's a good cheerleader, not so good on passing along good advice"
books,9 of 11,4.0,"""I had never encountered anything so hard, for which I was so ill prepared.""","Returning to the US after living in England for twenty years, Bill Bryson becomes intrigued with the idea of the hiking the Appalachian Trail, a portion of which is in his New Hampshire backyard.  The 2100-mile trail from Georgia to Mt. Katahdin in Maine winds through virgin forest and scenes of incredible natural beauty and provide an unparalleled opportunity to be alone and reflective."

books,1 of 1,5.0,"An outstanding, artistic celebration of the canine","Elliott Erwitt loves to take photos of dogs - all kinds of dogs doing all kinds of things - and Woof is a reflection of his passion for the animal, providing black and white shots of dogs in or near water, on land, on display, at play, and more. An outstanding, artistic celebration of the canine which dog and art lovers will find a satisfying blend of diverse images"

books,2 of 3,2.0,Infuriatingly narrow focus,"Vicky Oliver is a woman, lives in New York, and works in the advertising industry. Nothing wrong with any of that, except that she tends to forget that not everyone is exactly like her. The result of this is that if, like me, you are a man, live in South Carolina, and borrowed this book from your local library in order to prepare for an interview for an administrative position with the state Highway Patrol, much of the book might as well have been written in Chinese. Good for urban professional women seeking executive positions, but of limited use to anyone else"
books,1 of 48,1.0,The ultimate in selfishness,"So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic."
books,,4.0,Adult fairytale,"This is a fine piece of work by a talented author.  In essence it is a fairy tale for adults, written with some of the best prose I have ever read- smooth and flowing.  However, read Gaiman at your own risk.  His topics, sensibilities and ""shock value"" vary a great deal from book to book.  His books illustrate why some authors need to use pen names, so you can tell one type of writing from another"
books,1 of 1,5.0,So orginal it's hilarious!,"&quot;Why not write a cartoon book that doesn't bother with a main character and where each joke is totally different from the next?!&quot; That must have been similar to what Gary asked himself when starting to write his hilarious comic books. Every joke is truly different from the next one! And every joke is refreshingly original! Each joke comes from a thoughtful, clever and of course playful mind"
books,74 of 74,4.0,"When Marriage Gives You Heartburn, Make Blueberry Pies","If I had it to do over again, I would have made a different kind of pie. The pie I threw at Mark made a terrific mess, but a blueberry pie would have been even better, since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer.......so Rachel Samstat muses on her marriage to Mark Feldman."
books,63 of 68,5.0,"God Bless the Christian Atheist, Oriana Fallaci","Oriana Fallaci is no longer among the living. We will have to do without her unrelenting opposition to Islamic nihilism.  She died in the United States.  Her fellow Europeans essentially expelled her from the continent.  They made Fallaci's final years a living hell.  As an ex-Catholic, I am more then a little irritated by the Roman Church's capitulation to the radical Muslims.  Fallaci described herself as a Christian atheist and was more of a defender of the ""true faith"" than its own hierarchy!  ""This Catholic Church without which the Islamization of Europe, the degeneration of Europe into Eurabia, could have never have developed. This Catholic Church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted,"" added the author."
books,,5.0,A Great Read,"Of my 3 favorite books, this is one of them.  Made in Japan is part autobiography, history, economics, Japanese culture and business all rolled in to one.  The writing style is one of the most comprehensible I've ever read.  Very interesting, insightful, and informative.  Akio Morita is a very cool guy, and he's lead an interesting life.  If you like business, economics, or Japanese culture, this book is definitely worth the read"
books,1 of 5,2.0,Not so Tasty,"I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer"
books,2 of 3,5.0,"Wow Elizabeth, Just Wow","Elizabeth I CEO was a wonderful reading that inspired me a lot. My wife and I kept fighting on who gets to to have the book first, it is one of those books that you hate to leave unfinished. The lessons of Elizabeths leadership are compelling and quite inapiring."
books,3 of 6,2.0,Jennifer Weiner [...] - except not as good !,"This is the story of Alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he's had an affair with for months. This story was so disappointing: it's like Dunn took the same ideas as Jennifer Weiner's Good In Bed, i.e. being dumped, religion, pregnancy, friends, etc, but the end result is disappointing. The heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an Evangelical Christian (who cares?), how she slept with few men, etc. This story is not realistic, it's not that funny, and the heroin is disappointing. If you want the real thing, read Jennifer Weiner, but not Dunn, sorry"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A non-scholarly review.,"I really have the feeling that I am not knowledgable enough about the period in question in the Thucydides to provide any kind of reasonable context for the work. Instead, this review will focus on some reading tips and reactions aimed at the more generalist reader who may be attempting to get through the text."
books,1 of 4,4.0,Fun insightful read,"As a big March Madness fan, I couldnt help but check this book out from my local library. I love college basketball and especially the ""Big Dance"". This book is a great look behind the scenes at the Final Four and is full of valuable insight and interesting side stories."
books,2 of 2,5.0,The Best Book I Read in 2005,"And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many."
books,2 of 2,4.0,It's been a while since I picked up a Jack Reacher novel...,"and I'm glad that I did.  I read the Killing Floor many years ago and was not impressed.  It wasn't bad, but Child did not belong in the same league with many of the other author's in the genre that I enjoyed. 3 stars would be a generous rating for that first novel. First being the operative word. Boy, has Child's writing improved.  Full of terrific twists, One Shot is a great page turner with a very well thought out plot.  I plan to read the whole series.  Highly recommended"
books,4 of 5,4.0,People-power will bring us much more than blogs,"Beginning with the tremendous impact that blogging has wrought on top-down institutions such as government and big media, Reynolds uses the ""Army of Davids"" metaphor repeatedly to advance his theory that loose, decentralized networks of individuals will be the diriving force behind a multitude of amazing changes taking place over the next 30-50 years. When I say ""amazing"", there's not much hyperbole there- the colonization of space (seriously!) is one such dramatic change that Reynolds hopes will be come about thanks to the power of the individual bypassing the beaurocracy of a government."
books,29 of 31,5.0,Remember the Audience,"It is not difficult to dismiss Daniel Dennett's latest work, Breaking the Spell, as an under-researched and unscholarly polemic containing many assertions that are dubious and unproven at best.  Dennett, of course, would agree.  The book says from page one that it is not intended to be a scholarly work, nor is it intended to offer definitive proof as to the evolutionary origin of religion.  If this were what the book were trying to offer, then perhaps the ranting and raving about Dennett's lack of scholarship and his unverified claims would be more to the point.  As it stands, though, Breaking the Spell succeeds in getting its intended message across, and it does so in a manner that would not frighten off its intended audience--the average lay theist."
books,,5.0,YGBK Defined,"Young obviously was teasing us with the YGBK acronym -- daring us to read on and figure it out.  Later in the book, in one of his YGBK descriptions, he ends it with the statement &quot;you gotta be kidding.&quot"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Wow.,This is undoubtedly the strangest book I've read in a long time.
books,0 of 8,4.0,MARLON BRANDO,I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK AS IT WAS A PRESENT TO MY MOTHER.  I HEARD GOOD REVIEWS ABOUT IT ON THE WBAI RADIO HERE IN NEW YORK
books,3 of 6,4.0,Enlightening!,"A book by one of the most eminent writers on the psychology of death and dying, this volume goes through what the dying have to say to doctors, nurses, clergy and their own families. Other than the introductory chapters on the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, this volume is devoted to the interviews given by severely ill and dying patients to a class of medical and pastoral care professionals and those studying to fill these roles. The course was a collaboration between the medical school and college for the clergy; thus there is a strong Christian element. First, this grated on me a bit because of its exclusivity, but I soon realised that patients who chose to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and a chaplain would probably do so because of an already existing faith, which put things in perspective."
books,,5.0,Lewis's best,"To my mind, this is the best of Michael Lewis's work.  His style and observations show the humor and zing that have become his hallmark, and his writing is at top form.  Next examines the changes wrought by the Internet from the perspective of several entrepreneurs who have exploited its potential, mainly in the form of vignettes.  There is no beginning, middle or end, so if you're looking for a story with a plot line, this is likely not going to appeal to you.  The lack of story line is, however, what I found compelling - the theme of the book is, ""There's this 1800-pound bull out there that everyone is studying and avoiding, and here are a few folks who have ventured out and ridden the bull and had great rides.""  This is pretty much quintessential Michael Lewis - he finds an individual, or an event, or an industry that has fomented a paradigm shift (a deliberate choice of words here, since Moneyball dealt with the emergence of SABRmetrics, whose acolytes all seem to have read ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"")."
books,,4.0,book of the dead,"The final chapter to the ""war"" between brothers, a page turner which does lead to somewhat of a anti climax. I expected a more elaborate ending after such a build up during the three novels. But nevertheless a good ending to the series"
books,8 of 8,5.0,True Heroism,"'Faith of My Fathers' is the story of three men - the grandfather and father of John McCain, who created a legacy of a life in service for McCain (the third man) to follow.  It is their legacies that led the young John McCain to the Naval Academy and to a career in the Navy.  Yet the legacy of these two men is wrapped up in morals, values and patriotism - exactly what makes John McCain the great leader that he is."
books,1 of 1,5.0,An Achievement,"Three childhood friends from a Boston working class neighborhood, who lost their innocence through a tragic shared occurrence, are forced together again as adults when one of their daughters is murdered.  Each is wrapped tightly into the investigation, but each must also unwrap themselves in order come to terms with this latest tragedy and its conclusion."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Speaks to the heart, without annoying fluffiness.","Most of the time, How To Write books are either reeeeally touchy feely, or completely technical. I get annoyed about books like that because writing is a combination of both. So I wasn't convinced I'd much care for this book, which leans toward the touchy feely. I was NOT expecting to find touchy-feely with a hint of tough love."
books,0 of 6,5.0,The Italian Way,Secured Packaging.  Prompt.  I would do business with them again
books,3 of 3,5.0,Enough whining about the plot,"Suttree is an extremely challenging book.  I picked it up, read the first thirty or so pages, then put it down for two years before I finally dedicated myself to reading the whole thing.  The narrative occurs in elliptic little episodes, with no particular overarching plot.  Many reviewers here have cited this as a flaw, but McCarthy is breaking the ordinary traditions of narrative here for a reason - a life does not progress in neat order, nor do most people live to see some golden denouement that makes sense of all their previous decisions.  Suttree the character lives without this happy sense of order, and McCarthy has no desire to provide it to the reader.  As in life, some things happen, some more things happen, and then the story ends.  In the hands of a less skillful writer this could have been an appalling mess, but McCarthy's incredible gifts make it at once satisfying and heartbreakingly incomplete"
books,11 of 12,5.0,The sky wasn't the limit for me after I read this book,"I bought this book in 1990.  I carried it around in my purse for over a year reading and re-reading it.  It helped launch me in the career of my dreams.  Whenever I felt afraid, I would read this book.  Whenever I felt I wouldn't make it, I read this book.  I will give my daughter a copy when she graduates high school.  Dr. Dyer shares personal experiences and practical examples to help guide you.  He has been ahead on the road of happy transformation and he shares insights that are rock solid.  If I was stranded on a desert island, I'd take this book.  I have the audio cassette version as well, and am buying the CD version, too"
books,1 of 1,4.0,talisman,"I liked this book.  I like all of Kings books, some better than others and some I will read over and over and over.  This one is the Prequel to black house...I like this one better but they are both good and I would read them together if you haven't read either of them.."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Artemis good or bad,My son and I really enjoyed the book.  It has alot of twists in the plot that keep you hanging on every word.  I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a good suspense story with alot of fun attached.
books,4 of 4,4.0,One side of the story,"Let's be clear what we're buying here: an authoritative text on how to deploy character, crescendo, climax and theme in the idiom of the dramatic novel. Frey is covering the big picture, how skilled writers nurture the evolution of tensions through the work as a whole. His references to the classic canon of American fiction reinforce the message that these techniques are the essence of drama, and not just the stock in trade of pulp fiction."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Cafi Cohen Instills Confidence,"This is the second book I have read from Cafi Cohen. I find her writing straightforward, exciting, and relaxing at the same time."
books,13 of 13,5.0,"Man's best friend, forgotten...","This is a collection of photographs of dogs from various shelters, each with a short description of their situation. These dogs are the unlucky and unwanted, sometimes abondoned by their ""best friend"", and some are picked up as strays. The photos capture the character of these dogs, and some have such sad looks. It is heartbreaking to read that some of these dogs in this book were euthanized, sometimes simply due to the lack of space in shelters. In those cases, these photos are the only remaining evidence of their short existance. Recommended for anyone who loves dogs. A percentage of proceeds from sales go to shelters."
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Modern Classic....you'll read it like the meters running....,"Bonfire of the Vanities has long been hailed as one the greatest (the greatest?) American novels of the 1980's, and its accolades bear little use repeating. Nevertheless, a new look at this classic novel provides ample proof that while many aspects of society have changed in the nearly two decades since Bonfire was published, a great many other have, sadly, not.  Just add Starbucks, the Internet, and cellular phones; you'll find that the world described by this novel is very much alive in Gotham today."
books,5 of 5,5.0,Not the Lincoln you learned about in school,"A lost love he mourned for his whole life, an extremely difficult wife, endless attempts to undermine his authority, constant personal sorrow - who knew?  This book helped me understand and admire Lincoln the man, versus Lincoln the President.  They are both likable characters"
books,5 of 13,5.0,The best introduction to true and dedicated investment ever.,"This book is not meant to teach you about investing schemes as much as to validate the old known fact that equity markets beat anything else as an investing vehicle. The book is dedicated to illustrate to readers  the ultimate message ""patience is the vertue"". Great outline/charts to illustarte stocks advantage against any investment mechanism in the long run. The author also advised readers to implement a definsive style approach by investing in index funds to take advantage of the low managemenr fee and to mimic the broader market which he found to reflect around 12% in the past 200 years."
books,3 of 5,5.0,This is now my FAVORITE BOOK!,"I've read alot of books, Harry Potter Series, THe Hobbit, LOTR, Series of unfortunate events, Flyte & Magik, His Golden Materials...the list goes on.  I LOVE the Circle series, and The Will of the Empress is it's best addition yet.  I can't wait for more additions to the Circle reforged.  This book shows more of the characters personalities and how they are growing up.  How they thought they lost one another at childhood only to find a stonger bond.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes magic, Comedy, friendship and adventure"
books,,4.0,A thought-provoking book,"A very interesting probe into a practice that is not too far from home. Any parent can identify with the pain of having a child with health problems, and the moral dilemna of having to choose one child over another is full of anguish. Well written and enjoyed by all I have shared this with"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Read this book if you are serious about becoming a  real estate investor.,"I first learned of Dolf De Roos a few years ago from reading one of his first books that was released through the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series. I have read every one of his books and find his comments about real estate to be ""right on the money"". He shows you why real estate is the best place to invest and also how you can increase your profits by looking for unique situations. Very valid advice and a very good read. I highly recommend this book."
books,5 of 9,5.0,Practical To The Point,Douglas Stone demonstrates great awareness of the subject matter. He states the principles and then illustrates them with powerful examples. He made me think of my own approach in difficult conversations. The person who buys this book will not regret the purchase
books,,5.0,THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY,"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER, AND I READ 2 A MONT"
books,1 of 5,2.0,"In the end, did they have in common besides ABC news?","In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of ""how much do they have in common beides ABC?""  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever."
books,29 of 63,2.0,No healthy recipes here,"Many of the recipes use an abundance of heavy cream, half and half, whole milk or butter. I'm sure these dishes taste good, but people I cook for don't need to eat such rich food."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Approv,"With all the new, revised, and up to date versions of the Bible avaiable I was happy to find an edition still around that all christians can relate to.  I have 4 different editions of the Bible and the newer editions leave something to be desired.  The only problem I have with it is that the type is small."
books,7 of 15,4.0,"Excellent review of the decline of community, but somewhat blinded to the causes","Professor Putnam has written a superb review of the decliine of community in the United States through the end of the 20th Century. He points to television, urban and suburban sprawl, generational change and changing work habits as being the major causes of the collapse of the American community."
books,4 of 4,4.0,My review of the whole series,"I won't take the time to review each TPB of this series separately because really it's a continuous story that I think should be taken as a whole. The invisibles is very entertaining and highly thought provoking. Being that I've never read anything else by Morrison I don't know if he believes in the ideas expressed in spiritual science fiction style books, or whether this whole series was his type of satire. But it's a clever series, and worth it for fans of comic books, liberal politics, spirituality, conspiracy, punk rock, science fiction, and literature alike."
books,4 of 6,5.0,Excelente trabajo,"Un libro que se lee sin mayor dificultad gracias al lenguaje sencillo pero preciso, y en esto radica la magia del autor que de ese modo nos motiva a continuar. Libre de tecnicismos antropolgicos o histricos esta obra es  recomendable para todo aquel que desee enterarse sobre Mxico con una  visin clara, veraz y hasta divertida"

books,2 of 2,4.0,Brought comfort to me when I felt no one would understand,"Yes, much of the book was spent explaining how difficult it was for Brooke to become pregnant.  Perhaps it was explained to demonstrate how badly she and her husband wanted a child, only to have Brooke feel the complete opposite once her daughter was born.  I read this book while suffering from PPD.  Brooke's words were my words, she was speaking FOR me, when I could not articulate my thoughts, and was afraid of myself.  I finally had faith that I would not be ""the excepton"" and that even I could overcome PPD.  Also good reading is ""Conquering Postpartum Depression"" by Dr. Ron Rosenberg.  He's a dedicated doctor"
books,4 of 5,5.0,Buy this Book........,"A few weeks ago my digital camera quit working at a very bad time. I had to break out my twenty year old 35mm film camera and use it. I was stunned at the quality that my old Yaschica had over my digital camera. So I bought this wonderful book and never looked back. It is filled with great tips that are easy to understand. Tips on how to use differant lenses, filters and film. Not to mention great flash tips that almost eliminate red eye. My wife and friends are amazed at the quality of some of the pictures that I have taken. Plus digital pictures won't last but a few years stored on disk and a negative is almost forever. So if you want your memories to last a lifetime break out the old 35mm film camera and BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"

books,2 of 3,5.0,Fantastic for parents-to-be!,"We have this and the ""bible"" of maternity books, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting.""  But we may have well just thrown the other one away.  This book is great.  Each weeks there is information on how your baby is developing.  Many weeks have illustrations depicting what the baby might look like.  Info on the size and development of the baby and what changes are happening to the mother's body.  There are plenty of facts on things like nutrition and warning signs and symptions of disease.  And my wife's personal favorite was the ""Dad Tip"" each week.  It really is a well written book.  It doesn't overload you on information but keeps you aware of the mother's changing body and the development of the baby. A must have for any mother or father out there"
books,5 of 6,4.0,A Damn Good Book,"How to Write a Damn Good Novel is a very good book on the subject.  It is all inclusive, well written, and to the point.  The outline permits the reader to understand how to proceed and, because of a few very fine examples, to feel that it is possible.  Something I learned from this book that is not necessarily in others is the idea of developing a compelling premise before engaging in the long process of writing a novel.  The book is brief and could rank above the many books trying to help the writer with too many words"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Delightful Recollection,"The beauty of this book is that you get to know Bennett Cerf as the scholarly, brillant, and excellent businessman who met the most amazing and well known writers of the 20th century.

Everyone who I know that read this book fell in love with the characters especially the hereo in this book. You can't help but cry when reading it I am a Nicholas Sparks fan from all of his books. This is one of my favorite and would recommend anyone who has ever had a bet that was as close as a family member read this book you will fall in love

books,3 of 4,5.0,For every business executive,"This book has so many great accounting best practices it should serve as a goal for every company.  It is an invaluable reference guide to anyone who is just starting a business, or needing to improve the efficiency of their accounting functions."
books,,5.0,All the world is a romantic comedy.,I recently re-read AS YOU LIKE IT prior to attending The Colorado Shakespeare Festival's performance of this play under the summer stars here in Boulder. Shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this romantic comedy in 1599 and published it in the First Folio in 1623.
books,1 of 1,5.0,Escape to Paradise!,"This is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts. Setting is her specialty. She really knows how to take the reader with her on every adventure. You really come to care about these characters, and it's great to escape with them to the sunny ocean setting and go deep-sea diving for the very first time in your life! This one earned its 5 stars!"

books,6 of 7,4.0,Good Starter Book,"If you're just starting out in stocks and investing.  This is a good book.  It tells you to know your stocks, to do your homework when you buy stocks and how to pick good stocks.  It gives you some good places to start and it also gives you some history on Peter Lynch."
books,4 of 5,5.0,a book that can change your life,"This book is a radical wisdom teaching. The premise is simple - that the only reality is to be found in the present moment, but the realization of this changes the way we look at and react with the world. I've read the book twice: once to understand what he's talking about, and again to see how to apply it. I have given it to several friends. The best thing about the book is the question-and-answer format, which deals with most of the problems that come up. I also liked the references to Buddhism and Christianity. The book is especially valuable for people who deal with depression and/or anxiety. A lot of the reviews of this book are negative; as Tolle points out, the ego has a lot invested in its survival"
books,4 of 6,4.0,"no classic, but pretty fun",You should read this book if:
books,7 of 26,1.0,Nut case,"Type Cooper's name into Google and learn about what a nut job he really was.  He allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun.  A court issued an arrest warrant.  When two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them.  They returned fire, killing him"
books,66 of 74,4.0,From Physics to Econophysics,"I actually learned a lot math and physics from finance AFTER I earned my PhD in physics and started working as a senior analyst at a Houston based energy firm (NOT ENRON), and Hull's wonderful book got me started in econophysics, or econometrics as it is often called."
books,2 of 6,5.0,Author Crush,"My first Michael Ruhlman book was ""Making of a Chef"" It was simply amazing. He wrote in such an accessible way that I wrote him a gushing email (something I had never done) which he was gracious enough to answer. I have since read all of his other books, including Boy's Themselves and the French Laundry Cookbook. He has become one of my favorite authors and this latest book is one of his best. If you haven't read them, I strongly suggest you read Making, and Soul of a chef first. Altough it isn't necessary to take the journey in the order it was written, it is more enjoyable."

books,2 of 5,5.0,THIS BOOK IS THE PREGNANCY BIBLE!,"Ok, so there might be some parts that are negative, but really- how cool is it to tell your husband, partner, whatever that ""This week the ears will be growing and the baby will be able to start to hear things"" or ""The baby is now the size of a peanut- look at the scaled drawing in the book of what our baby looks like!""  I think that this is a great book.  Always take things with a grain of salt, but this book rocks.  I buy it for all my friends that are having babies.  Very informative, and the pics are really cool.  I thought this was the BEST book, way better that ""what to expect when you are expecting""  yuck!  :"
books,1 of 4,5.0,"I'm ba-a-a-ck, Herr Koontz!","HELLO, PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL HORROR NOVELIST !  You are about to get the shock of your life when you learn that I, the ""preposterously over-educated"" (thank you very much, Dean, I appreciated that one) Mark Ahriman is NOT DEAD, NEVER DIED, AND WOULDN'T THINK OF DYING  before running my evil nemesis and his first-and-last-born sons into the grave for writing horrible reviews OF MY WELL-RECEIVED AND 78-WEEKS-ON-THE-BESTSELLER-LIST ""How To Love Yourself."" Though seemingly wasted by the gun-toting billionaire twit and Keanu-phobe, I, like Skeet, Dusty's half-brother (who I thought I'd finished off on the beach), was wearing a Kevlar vest.  As if the Great Ahriman could be erased as easily as that.  Neither by White-Out nor the nib of a No. 2 pencil, with which, I am certain, you, Herr Koontz are admirably supplied.  No, no, no, dear novelist-to-the- middle-brow.  I have also decided to stick around to help you overcome being second-place to that New England bumpkin (you-know-who) whose stupid, working-class creations have always sold more copies than the yearly mass consumption of toilet paper, and whose formulaic, soporiphic stories seem always to be being made into films and TV mini-series.  I know you pretend to call  him ""friend,"" dear writer, but we both know you've been seething for years over the inequity: that a low-life potato-eater from Maine is the  No. 1 horror writer in America, and not  you - the word-smith  we all know  you to be.  Here's a  ""test"" haiku for the Amazon site of his latest book.  I'll program him to fail.  ""I'll never be as good as Koontz/I'm crushed under the weight of his indomitable prose. God help me!""  or something like that.  Let me know what you think.  As I dawdle here under the awning of La Junquette Riche, my favorite French boite, downing a chocolate croissante and a YooHoo, I can't help wondering why  these imbecilic reviewers didn't notice that ""False Memory"" is  screamingly funny?  ""It 's hard to be a sadist in a world of self-mutilators"" - well, that one sure cracked me up, and as you know, I'm usually the one DOING the crack-up.  Anyway, as I always say: DOWN WITH THE TOFU POLICE, UP WITH HOMICIDAL SNOBBERY, and ONWARD FOREVER WITH GREAT WRITING...starting with ""How To Love Yourself,"" of course.  Don't count me out - we need a sequel!"
books,1 of 5,4.0,Very good book,Overall very interesting and nice historical book even though the POV's shift rather awkwardly and seem disjointed at times.  The book also provides a good narration of the competition between the Cuban and American meteorological services.
books,,5.0,Incredibly fascinating!,"This book is so interesting on so many different levels. It talks about people who are autistic and the way their brains work differently from non-autistic people and it talks about the similarities in the ways that autistic people and animals brains work and process information. Written by an autistic woman who fills the text with lots of first hand experience she really helped me to understand animals on a whole new level. I'm not much of a reader of non-fiction, but this book is so interesting. You'll learn a lot. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying something new. Very good and worth the money"
books,,5.0,A Great Buy,"When I first bought the book, I didn't think it could be just as good as the outlander series, since I adore them and it hadn't any of those character. The John Grey book amazed me with its mystery, alway had me on the edge of my seat... I devoured it in 2 days, I couldn't put it down."
books,15 of 16,4.0,Very enjoyable but you have to concentrate,"This is a monster of a book packed full of insight into the plays of William Shakespeare. Another reviewer has criticized the way Professor Gerber tackles each play, but I think she pitches her analyses pretty spot on. As she describes a play she will stop and detour into some aspect of the cultural mores of the England of Shakespeare's day and come back. I find ( as a layman ) that is exactly what I wanted. I wasn't looking for Heavy Textual Criticism that might only be understandable to other Eng Lit Professors. This is an excellent book for the layman - if you are prepared to concentrate and forgive Professor Gerber when she does occasionally throw in a semantics term that you have never heard of - USUALLY she explains them. But not always."

books,,4.0,//////////////,"""`E' is for Evidence"" is the fifth in a series of Sue Grafton's mystery novels about the loner ex-cop private detective Kinsey Millhone.  In this episode, Kinsey is framed for insurance fraud along with her high school friend's brother, Lance Wood.  As she tries to clear her name, she gets caught up in the Wood family politics and we get to see a softer side of Kinsey than she would probably care to show.  Grafton does a thorough job of developing her characters along with providing enough detail to allow the reader to feel as though he or she is actually in Santa Teresa, California.  The twists and turns that this story takes will keep you guessing until the end"
books,,4.0,A Good Read...,"The Talisman chronicles the adventure of a twelve year old boy named Jack Sawyer. The young hero sets out from the East Coast of the USA in a bid to save his mother, who is dying from cancer. Jack needs to find the mystical artifact known only as the 'The Talisman'."
books,7 of 12,5.0,Wonderful Reading for any Age!,"The Brothers' Grimm wrote beautiful fairy tales, and they can be enjoyed by all ages.  I think I enjoyed them most when I read them to my own children, but I have read them again since, and enjoyed them again.  I read this collective edition in order to get all of them at one go, so to speak.  The Brothers' Grimm were not writers by profession.  They were scientific philologists, but decided to make up a collection of folktales.  They spent thirteen years gathering the tales from various sources, and then put them down in writing in order to preserve them.  Everyone knows these tales, but to name a few - The Frog Prince, Rumplestiltskin, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.  These tales have endured and been loved for many years, and Disney has made some very memorable animated movies out of quite a few of them.  Read them for your enjoyment, and to recapture  a little of your lost youth"
books,,5.0,Read it non-stop,"My brother picked this book up in an airport on the way to Mexico with my family. He was literally laughing out loud for days and relayed sotries to me and my dad. I decided when he finished it, I'd give it a go, though I was unsure about some of the author's views on women. But let me say in short that I, as a 22 year old female, LOVED THE HECK outta this book."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Prose with a unique flavor,"Other reviews have given the outline of the narrative, but a good way to convey the strength and variety of the writing - not always cynical, as some suggest - is to follow the example of the reviewer who quoted the first line as a touchstone. (Sell the apples by offering a free bite.)  In that respect, here are a few more snippets -"

books,0 of 2,2.0,Only Because I Paid for It.,I more or less forced myself to read the entire book because there were some great anecdotes and also several nodes of connectivity where someone famous first got their start working with some of the other persons mentioned in its pages.
books,3 of 4,5.0,Great Book!!,"As a new Sharepoint Administrator, this book has been a valuable tool during the implementation process of my site. Bill does a great job of explaining some of the more difficult to understand features in language that is easy for even beginners such as myself to follow. If your task is to implement a new Sharepoint site, this book will be your best friend"
books,4 of 6,5.0,A monument of religious demographics for Christians,"David Barrett and Todd Johnson at the World Evangelization Research Center in Richmond, Virginia have just completed the 2nd edition of the World Christian Encyclopedia. This 2,400 page, 2-volume reference set tells the status of Christianity and of evangelization in great detail for every country, people, language, city, and province in the world -- together with a trove of other information, statistics, and resources for the decision-makers in the world of missions. A companion CD, the World Christian Database, is planned to follow. This particular work, when complete, will help facilitate the analysis now missing from this monumental enterprise, a truly impressive work of religious, especially Christian, demographics. There is really nothing like it in terms of sheer raw data"

books,4 of 5,5.0,Terrific!,"Michael Boone, a thirty-something painter who has gone out of fashion, is desperate to have his newest work noticed and to reestablish himself as a success. Michael is also the reluctant caregiver to his mildly autistic brother Hugh, who has a disabled yet perceptive view of his frustrated brother. In THEFT: A LOVE STORY, these Boone brothers narrate a story of thwarted talent, desperate ambition, fraternal responsibility, and loutish dependence, which becomes a mystery of theft and love when they meet Marlene Leibovitz, a beautiful art authenticator who may know something about a valuable stolen painting. The question that this fascinating novel poses is: How far will Michael Boone, who is angry at the art establishment, go to achieve artistic and emotional success? Where does he draw the line?"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Simultaneously hilarious and insightful,"Michael Lewis has an almost unique talent for providing one with an intuitive feel for a subject while simultaneously making you laugh out loud.  I think I learned more about Wall Street from ""Liar's Poker"" than all the great serious tomes I've read, while at the same time enjoying it as pure farce, and yet I was left with an increased respect for the people and institutions.  How is that even possible?"
books,11 of 24,4.0,"Popular book, completely unjustified conclusion","I give this book a high rating because of its influence in the field.  It is the first case study of laboratory science ever published, and is often quoted in anthropology, sociology, and philosophy of science.  The book's conclusion is social constructivist in nature, to a very extreme degree.  Scientific facts are not discovered, they are constructed through social processes.  The actual study was done by Latour, a French philosopher, and the method was to assume strangeness.  That is, Latour pretended he didn't know anything about what the scientists were doing and tried to make up (construct) an account.  The usual problems with relativism plague Latour and Woolgar's brand of social constructivism, most notably issues with reflexivity.  If scientific accounts are constructed and do not have to do with the phenomena, why should we think that Laboratory Life tells us anything about the phenomena of laboratory science?  Their answer is that we shouldn't.  The only question in evaluating texts is, &quot;are you convinced?&quot;  If not, fine.  Come up with a better (more persuasive) account.  People who think that science, philosophy, and academe in general should have something to do with the real world will be horribly frustrated by this conclusion.  But everyone should be frustrated by the fact that the conclusion just doesn't follow from the data Latour gathered.  It seems to come entirely from prior convictions of the authors.  I recommend reading the book, however, because of its popularity and because it is a fantastic exemplar of a bad relativist and constructivist argument.  Get the revised edition, which has a postscript and extra references.  For a chuckle, look up some of the reviews (cited in the 2nd ed. references) from scientific journals.  They are mostly cheerful recognitions of the book's subject matter (laboratory science) without any reference to--or argument with--the strong anti-realist claims.  It makes you wonder if these people acctually read the book"

books,,5.0,Burke Just Gets Better,"One of the best writers of environment and character descriptions, Burke just gets better and better to the point that I can smell the air after a rain storm in New Iberia thanks to the way he puts it. Colors in his landscapes come to life in my mind's eye as though I were there."
books,25 of 109,1.0,Agitprop from the master himself,"Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Classic leadership text,"Heifetz' definition of leadership revolves around the concept of influence rather than subordination or coercion.  Using contrast to sharpen his own definition of leadership, he wrote that there is an important difference between imagining that a leader influences a community to follow her vision and influencing a community to face its problems."

books,16 of 19,5.0,You have to know what you have before you can fix it,"This book is primarily for dogs aggressive on leash, same dogs off leash are fine with most, if not all, other dogs. It is only one of 28 catagories of aggression or combination thereof. The benefit to getting this booklet is that 1) you can determine if this is really the problem before you invest in a lot of more expensive books that deal with all manner of aggression. AND 2) You should be working with a trainer on ANY kind of aggression issue. This booklet will help you to know what type of methods are likely to be effective and you will have something to refer to as you are working with the trainer - I would not work with anyone who is not familiar and endorses at least some of McConnell's positive training recommendations."
books,42 of 43,5.0,"Jerry Dorsman is a professional, and his book can help you!","I've worked with Jerry Dorsman closely, and I wanted to share with you my personal high regards for Jerry Dorsman and his new book &quot;How to Quit Drugs for Good&quot;.  I was fortunate enough to see Jerry apply many of  the methods he details in his book with real people in real settings.   Jerry is not a one-track thinker and is aware that different strokes work  for different folks.  The purpose of his book is to highlight the whole  spectrum of treatments available for addictions so that the reader can  better select a treatment more suitable to their unique needs.  It is a  comprehensive manual that goes into detail about all drugs, their effects,  and effective treatments and therapies available.  One would do very well  in selecting this book to help themselves or as a manual in helping others  in the field of addictions treatment.  I found his first book &quot;How to  Quit Drinking Without AA&quot; an essential tool in my own counseling  experiences.  It was so incredibly useful from a concrete treatment  perspective that I referenced it in my own treatment plan development.  I  saw great results, and I stand by that.  That's all I needed to see. Now I  recommend all his books, because he cuts right to the chase without all the  fluff.  When you're in trouble, you don't want to waste time.  You want to  know what to do and how as soon as you can.  This book is not the cure, but  it's the best stepping stone to the cure only you can provide.  Trust me on  this"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Helps a lot,"I am a 17 year gay guy from ohio and let me say, this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I felt and feel like I AM the character of Russell in the book, I've gone through so many of the things he has. I even cried after reading the sequel after this one because it made me look at my own situation and how hard it is to be gay and love someone who might never talk to you again if they knew. I feel like this book deserves several awards, it certainly had a touch to me"
books,4 of 4,4.0,Warning! Noemata are attached!,"Moran's way-path through phenomenology is truly phenomenal!  I say that it is a way-path and not a work because it is not an end in itself, but truly the beginning of an ever continuing/renewing end.  It has been extremely helpful as I work my way through phenomenology."

Barbara has done an excellent job of combining personal experience, reviewing the scientific literature and inspiring the reader, to produce a life-changing book. She goes through extraordinary lengths to find answers to the disease that once haunted her and  comes up a winner. And you can get the benefit of her vast experiences and research for the cost of a book."
books,5 of 6,5.0,Judith Viorst comes up with another great Alexander story,"""Alexander And The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" is an absolute classic of children's literature, even if I have heard Judith Viorst's story done way too often at speech tournaments. The idea of feeling so mad or sad that you want to move to Australia remains one of the great punch lines. In ""Alexander's Not (Do You Hear Me? I Mean It!) Going to Move"" she comes up with a story almost as good. Alexander might talk about moving to Australia, but when his mom and dad tell him that the family is moving to a new home a thousand miles away he decides that he is not going to move. He is not even going to pack."
books,3 of 3,4.0,Exciting audio w sound effects,"I listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away, it is a find!  Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers.  I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book.  I also liked that the story was partly done in first person.  The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world....."
books,1 of 3,4.0,Packed With Knowledge!,"Monica Langley follows Sandford Weill, a shy Jewish boy from Brooklyn, through his youthful struggles against adversity, his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success. Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We recommended Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative"

books,,5.0,"the ""ultimate"" edition for superheroes.","I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better, with panels as evocative as the prose. The hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces (even if a bit heavy to handle.....). But if you are looking for extra material (as the new edition of Mythology) you could be disappointed"
books,5 of 7,5.0,Masterful survey of American colonial history,"Traditionally, coverage of ""colonial America"" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage.  Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants."

For both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others."
books,0 of 17,1.0,AHHH VERY boring,This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book?
books,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent read for those aspiring in the arts,"I knew absolutely nothing about Elia Kazan prior to reading this book. He does a superb job of reconstructing his life from his early years learning theatre stage craft at Yale all the way through to his final years (he was 78 when he completed the book). He is seemingly forthwright about many of the tough decisions he faced throughout his career from the House of UnAmerican Activities revealing of many of his old 'comrades', which he does a decent job of articulating why he did whatthat, even if on the surface it seems lecherous."

I'm no longer a pro shooter but I do need a handle on effective archiving schemes for my images. Peter does an excellent job of explaining his system that allows users to archive, organize and FIND your images. Well though out system that makes sense. While I'm no longer a working Pro shooter, I still have associations with pro's I went to photo school with (years before digital) or folks I work with and I recommend they pick up this book and read it cover to cover."

books,1 of 1,4.0,Great Info,"Overall this was a really good book.  Like any business book, you need to apply what you read, rather than just read it for the advice to work, and everything in this book will work.  The only reason for this not receiving 5 stars was the name dropping began to get a little old, at least for me.  I understand that it drives the point home about what someone who came from humble beginnings can accomplish through networking, but not everyone wants to hear every famous person the author is friends with.  And Ariana Huffington is the last person I would be bragging I had over for dinner"

I'm such a dunce, I didn't see until too late that, on the title page, clearly marked, it reads, ""A special publication of the Library of America.""  No wonder it's so America-centric, but I picked up the book and opened it by happenstance to Penelope Gilliatt's scintillating review of Fassbinder's Petra Von Kant, and naturally I took the book to be more international in scope than it actually is.  In what universe do people think of Gilliatt as a US writer?  It doesn't really matter because what remains deserves four stars."
books,,4.0,Not Bad At All!,"I just finished this book, and thought, ""I could see where someone would say it was boring.""  But I just loved the story, loved the history of Sarah tracking down her great-grandmother, loved the details of the house (and was very jealous of such a nice house!), and all in all, this was one of the better of Danielle Steel's recent works.  Yes, there was some repetition, but not as bad as ""Impossible.""  I would say if you've been hesitating to pick up a Danielle Steel book lately, as I have, this one might actually be enjoyable!!  Is she on her way back?  I know we all hope so as we know she is capable of great work, that's why we stay her fans"

books,1 of 2,5.0,Interesting!,A lot of good factual information written in a readable fashion.  I want my family to read this book.  Anyone who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area should read this!  I've already ordered another copy as a gift
books,2 of 2,4.0,HAHAHA,"This book is a final middle finger to all those who can't see it for what it is. A last footnote to an incredible body of work dedicated to breaking the rules. I thinks its rather entertaining. Way to go old man, I get it"
books,11 of 11,4.0,"Odd Premise, Great Book","D IS FOR DEADBEAT is an odd story - Kinsey is hired to give $ 25,000 to a fifteen-year-old. Should be simple, right? Not with Sue Grafton writing the book!!  When Kinsey's retainer check bounces things really start to get interesting!! Next Kinsey finds the deadbeat who wrote the check, he was dead. Now she has to find out who killed him in order to get paid!"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Partial recipe for resonant leadership,"A good framework for Servant Leadership style. Authors drive the point home by hammering three concepts into reader's mind: mindfulness, hope, and compassion. However the book fall short on emphasizing the power of ""serving others,"" which I believe is a vital ingredient for resonant leaders. Many useful real life examples"
books,7 of 7,4.0,Compelling- All politics aside,"I usually stay away from bios of politicians, especially reads on living politicians who frequently write to exonerate/excuse/justify/blame etc... This book is a great read sice McCain's political life is purposely avoided. Sen McCain, obviously and justifiably proud of his heritage, spends a good deal of time delving into his family tree. Coupled with naval and military history, this potion of the book is interesting, though I felt a little too detailed. His war time experiences are horrific and inspiring. The bravado I expected to accompany his experiences was not there. He is a man who had a job to do and he did it. He suffered greatly, and he explained his weaknesses. He is straighforward and shows a personal and vulnerable side not shown in his political discussions. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to appreciate true hardships the power of the human spirit to shine"

books,3 of 10,4.0,"A bible, that's limited in scope.","Although John Hull's book ""Options, futures, and other derivatives"" is considered by many to be the bible for understanding derivatives , I think this book took the same shortcut that many books on this topic have taken. That is, they've focused on options where the underlying asset are stocks, exclusively. I suppose Hull's reason was to simplify an already complex topic. Yet, as a recent graduate with a degree in economics, I was hoping to find more information on options with commodities future contracts as the underlying asset. The book is fairly easy to follow. the dialogue is interesting without being boring. However, if your interested in a beginning book about derivatives, look somewhere else. If your interested in a book about derivatives that offers strategies, some useful math, and bases most of the discussion around stocks, this book might just be for you."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent,This book is excellent and teaches various psychological methods to influence people.  It makes a lot of references to NLP and cognitive psychology.  Very helpful in the real world.  Well written by a knowledgeable professional
books,0 of 1,2.0,Outdated---Ancient History,"Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic"
books,1 of 5,5.0,"Chefs, Pop Culture and Very Well Done!","Mr. Ruhlman gives us another perfectly plated culinary tome with his entertaining look inside the world of the celebrity chef phenomenon in America.  With his usual quirky humor he examines all sides of the 'Pop Culture of Cooking' and what forces make or break chefs in becoming, not just household names, but brands unto themselves."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Carolina Moon - A Very Good Story,"Young 8-year old Hope Lavelle is out on a nighttime adventure to meet her very best friend, 8-year old, Tory Bodeen, a victum of neglect and abuse by both her mother and father.  Hope has every comfort of life and is the daughter of a successful southern family with a twin sister, Faith and an older brother, Cade (Kincade).  Sneaking out to meet Tory, Hope is murdered.  The story moves ahead 18 years and picks up w/Tory as an adult dealing with the ghosts of her past and present.  ""Carolina Moon"" is a very well-written story and will keep you fascinated until the very conclusion.  Supporting players such as Iris, Cecil (Tory's grandma and significant other) as well as Wade (her cousin), add amazing color to the plot.  Personalities are described so well you can almost see these people and feel for each in their dealings with life's turmoil as well as joy.   I would definitely recommend this book to all, especially Nora lovers!  It has murder, mystery, romance, and comedy.  What more could you ask for in a book"
books,1 of 2,4.0,"Good plot, smelly hero","There is nothing essentially wrong with the plot and its suspense: sniper gets caught for multiple murder; the case seems watertight, then isn't, then gets solved by the hero from outside, the solution involving some inside dirt."
books,5 of 6,5.0,Great book - Bad translation,"This book is a must read for anyone interested in expanding their awareness in life. I am Russian, so read this book in its original language and just for kicks in English. This translation by Richard Pevear is pretty bad, as well as the one by Mirra Ginsberg. This one is choppy and not well written, and the one by Mirra just doesn't do the original work justice. It's not poetic at all. The best translation is with the red and black cover with a profile of a cat."
books,1 of 5,4.0,God is in heaven,"Staub has an interesting way of interlacing biblical tradition from both the Old and New Testaments with actions and pronouncements of the principal characters. In fact, one might evn, after reading this book, conclude that the Star Wars series was nothing but a long-running morality play which parallels the major morals and ethical values of much of the civilized world. Certain to provoke thoughtful reflection"
books,3 of 4,2.0,What a disappointment after Friendship Cake.,"This book really fell flat.  Lynne Hinton's first book Friendship Cake what such a good read.  I was sincerely disappointed in her second work.  She had a good beginning, but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant, and a little dull.  There was some hope of a good plot, but something was definitly missing.  Try again Lynne, you have talent.  Maybe try a sequel to Friendship Cake.  The characters that you developed in that book are really good"

Mr. Clancy always kept me on the edge and he is able to put in alot of great info and he knows soo much about alot of what he writes in his boo
books,2 of 2,4.0,Congo,"This was another great novel by Michael Crichton. This book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members, then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language. The gorilla will help them out in the end... They will find some other stuff that they didn't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Even for non-Maya users...,"I knew before purchasing that this book was centered around Maya, and understandably so, as it is the industry standard.  However, as a trueSpace user I found this book to be very useful.  We can't exactly set up rigs and controls the way Jason does in Maya, but the theories and other ideas presented in the book hold true no matter what application you are using."

books,,5.0,Even kids have their off days,"Kids can certainly relate to all the bad things that happen to Alexander and they understand the importance of each. From getting gum in his hair to a cavity to not even getting the pair of tennis shoes he really wanted, children can commiserate with his woes from their own experiences. This book is a great reminder that even though as an adult we may think it isn't a big deal, to a kid it's a major bummer. (And of course, tomorrow is another day, so things may not be so bad afterall."
books,13 of 13,5.0,"Still Here: Embracing Aging, Changing, and Dying- A Book Rev","When I picked up the book ""Still Here"" from a roadside bookstall at MG Road, Bangalore, I was attracted by the title and the face on the front cover that looked very Western and yet carried a Hindu name, Ram Dass.  The title raised certain questions in my mind.  Why still here?  Where was the author before?"

books,3 of 3,5.0,Fields of Gold,"As a native Oklahoman, I found this to be a great book.  It portrayed small town life very well.    It was obvious Mrs. Bostwick did her research.   Her portrayal of the hot summers was particularly accurate. The characters were real, with flaws and strengths that made them easy to relate to. The book was so engaging, I finished it in two days; because I wanted to see how it turned out.   I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes Dorthy Garlock, Jan Karon or Philip Gulley.   As a matter of fact,  I liked it so well, that I'm buying a copy for a friend's birthday."
books,,4.0,A thought-provoking book,"A very interesting probe into a practice that is not too far from home. Any parent can identify with the pain of having a child with health problems, and the moral dilemna of having to choose one child over another is full of anguish. Well written and enjoyed by all I have shared this with"
books,8 of 12,4.0,"authorised corporate bio, but a truly excellent one","This is a great bio of a great company.  Though it is somewhat dated, this book will set the standard for every deep inquiry into how McDonald's operates.  It is simply a remarkable story."
books,0 of 9,5.0,It's a hard subject to get right,"Seems like an easy enough subject.  But so many books like this are just fluffy ideas for employers to rah rah, and lie, to the employees.  Said to say it's true."
books,11 of 14,1.0,Dangerous,"Zweig made his reputation as a market timer, and 2/3 of this book presents a detailed market timing model that incorporates both ""money indicators"" (e.g. prime rate, fed funds rate, consumer debt) and a basic momentum indicator.  The model is relatively simple and the method is clearly explained.  According to Zweig's data, the system produced remarkable results up through the final revision of this book (in 1996)."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Ingenious ways to measure probability,"""Against the Gods; The remarkable story of risk,"" is a world-class history of ingenious ways to measure probability.  Author Peter L. Bernstein approaches the subject of risk/uncertainty with patience and unfolds a stirring tale of how civilization dicovered ways to improve the understanding of probability."
books,0 of 1,2.0,"Good, but weak for Hillerman","I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up."
books,5 of 5,5.0,5 stars is not enough....,"As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse I found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person.  This book will stick with me a long time and I hope even though it is long, readers will give it the chance it deserves. I thought this work by Mr. Iles to be very insightful."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Typical Heinlein; a good one to start with.,"Farmer In The Sky is one of 14 ""juvenile"" science fiction novels written by Robert A. Heinlein (Stranger In A Strange Land, The Puppet Masters, etc.) between 1947 (Rocket Ship Galileo) and 1962 (Podkayne Of Mars).  It is not one of the author's best works, but probably the most typical - that is, the best single example of his work, fitting, in more ways than one, right in the middle.  Heinlein's juvenile novels are all exceptionally well-written, as entertaining and enlightening for adults as for teenagers, but appropriate for kids to read.  Each novel (with a couple exceptions) deals with space exploration in settings that expand on the previous novels - first, the moon, and later on, the stars."
books,,4.0,Good read if visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam,This book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by Anne Frank. I read the book in high school and then recently read it after my husband and I visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. It was so interesting to read the book after having visited the real. I would almost recommend reading it before and after visiting the site
books,1 of 1,5.0,Gorgeous prose,"Generally I like my books fast and plot-driven, with minimal description and at least quasi-linear plots lines. While Invisible Cities is none of those things, I would rate it among my favorite books. The prose is incredible, rich, almost erotic. At times I felt my heart beating faster as I read it. This is a book to linger inside of, to re-read often, to keep by your bedside to read snatches of before you go to sleep."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Beauty at its literary best!,"Mishima's Spring Snow is a rare jewel of a work! The passion, tragedy and intensity of this novel left me wanting to pursue the entire 'Sea of Fertility' series.  I will shortly be reading 'Runaway Horses' which follows it, but have been forewarned not to expect anything quite on the scale of 'Spring Snow.'  Luckily, this doesn't concern me, Mishima's writing style is visual, entrancing and magnetic.  He takes hold of your imagination, curiosity and emotions from the very first chapter, and you just can't stop till the final page. I myself was dreading reaching the final page of Spring Snow, as I knew that to read such a glorious book again may not come for a long while."
books,4 of 6,5.0,An excellent book for pregnant couples,My wife and I receieved this book as a gift when we announced her pregnancy.  It is by far our favorite pregnancy book.  The week-by-week format is perfect for following along with your progress and also makes it nice to read together.  There are even helpful hints for dads along the way.
books,13 of 13,5.0,"A ""Must Read""","Soulcraft is a must read for any individual seeking meaning to their life through soul-connection. The book is unpretentious, easy to read, yet profound. Bill takes us on a journey of his and various other individuals' lives. At the same time, he offers us practical tools to engage in our own soul journey. Soulcraft will make many of us want to go on a Vision Quest to encounter our deepest fears with the intention of reconnecting to our Soul and living our Divine purpose."
books,4 of 5,5.0,a  book to read as a youngster or an oldster,"I first read this book at about age 12.  That period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man's best friend, so I was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup, took his dog, and drove around the United States. It didn't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an ""old guy"".  He shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill.  You want to grab a sleeping bag, some grub, and hit the road.  At that time, I was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in Steinbeck's camper.  It would be a few years before I saw the movies ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath"", which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who John Steinbeck was and what he was about.  In ""Travels With Charley"" the reader doesn't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of Steinbeck's fiction.  In this book Steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man, like Andy Rooney.  Now that I'm getting kind of old myself, I find myself experiencing the changes in the world Steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book.  When he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer, you get the willies along with Steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea, manned by the very young, protecting us, yet at the same time menacing.  The first time I read his description of the waitress in the diner in Maine, so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy, I had never met that kind of person before.  Since then I have worked with many just like her.  My favorite part was when Steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in Maine.  Also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous ""top 40"" songs on the radio, last generation's castoffs as today's antiques, and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place.  Steinbeck got road-weary halfway through the book, his dog got sick, and everything seemed wrong.  He witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early '60s.  The badlands and the South creeped him out, and he couldn't wait to get back home.  Isn't that just the way a real trip works?"
books,3 of 5,4.0,A good read to a wonderful ending of a series,"I really enjoyed reading about Seth and his life. This book added so much humor to make the situations a bit more fun, especially since Seth is still young. Reading about him as a man was far better than hearing about him when he was a boy. However, a wonderful ending to a series...."
books,0 of 1,5.0,The Payoff,"Portuguese Irregular Verbs is the setup and The Finer Point of Sausage Dogs is the payoff. You get to know Prof. von Iglefeld and his cronies in the first book, which helps you laugh even more reading about sausage dogs and other absurdities. Of course if you want to laugh out loud, 44 Scotland Street is the model. I had to read most of it out loud on a 1400 mile ferry trip up the coast of Alaska last summer"
books,2 of 5,5.0,Beautiful,"A work of art, Makine's use of language is stunning.  Not a quick read, I frequently had to stop and ponder many profound passages.  Literature as an art form is not dead"
books,3 of 5,5.0,The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit by Thomas Lucier,An official Library Weekly book review.
books,3 of 4,5.0,"Not a Fan of the Game, but a Fan of Kluger Now!","Let me state, for the record, I'm not a fan of baseball unless, of course, it's my husband or boys out on the field (and even then, I keep my mouth shut because I really don't know what I'm watching).  That said, I wasn't sure how I'd do with this book, but I found myself heavily engrossed in it right from the first word and loved every bit of it."
books,3 of 9,5.0,The Chef in Transition with New Reach,"It's not that obvious from the outset exactly what trip Ruhlman wants to take the reader on, nor if one wants to journey.  Beginning with story of Keller of French Laundry fame losing his shoes at his new NY/NY outing, he begins to unfold the sudden and dramatic shift of what it means to be a chef in this sudden gush of American infatuation with food and a whole new burgeoning generation of foodies.  Certainly worth the read to keep going, especially through CIA changes and exotic space age stuff done by Achatz in early chapters."
books,,5.0,"Heart, Spirit, Soul - it will change the way you think.","All of Brown's books are required reading for any one who follows the mystery of spirit. Yet, Grandfather, is my personal favorite. Stalking Wolf was a man fully in confluence with Spirit, and with his own personal vision. Brown has honored the teachings of this Apache Elder/Medicine Man/Sage, and in his verse one discovers both profound and practical advice to change the way we walk on Mother Earth."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Peek-A-Boo...I See You,"I remember when I first got into spirituality and metaphysics, I was so naive about certain things. I really thought that once a person begins to practice their True Self...their Inner Spirit...when they remember that they were a Soul with a body and not a body with a Soul...than they were automatically free from all things human; they were impervious to any thing from the sniffles to cancer to death. But the thing is, that no matter how ""advanced"" we are on the Spiritual Path, and I use that word with some hesitation, because there is no advancing on the Spiritual Path, we are already as Spiritual as we are ever going to be, the bottom line is that we are still in the world of form. This is where the words of Jesus ring so clear, ""Be in the world, but not of it..."" In other words, remember that no matter what may be going on in your world, you are still a Spiritual Being NO MATTER WHAT!"

books,2 of 9,1.0,"Ken Starr, another rightwing hack masking Bush/Cheney !!!",Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief !
books,4 of 5,5.0,Gary's got the vision!,"Gary Hoover's book is just the thing for managers, executives and entrepreneurs who want to learn Hoover's unique methods for seeing and seizing opportunities for new business in markets of all types. If you've every had a chance to hear Hoover speak during one of his many lecture engagements, then you know just how dynamic his ideas can be. Pick up this book as soon as you can and you'll be dreaming up new business ideas of your own starting with page one"
books,44 of 45,5.0,"Surprisingly Easy to Read, Heavy on Logic With Much Detail","There have been many comments on this book in the ten years since it was first published. I think what Carl Sagan said about the book is perhaps the most accurate: ""a breath of fresh air"". Contrary to many other people I thought the book by Dennett was easy to read, very well written, very straightforward, and not some sort of heavy philosophical discussion. He has lots of examples and many references to real science. It even contains pictures and many schematics. The basic point of the book is that despite any rumour or suggestions to the contrary, scientific, social, religious, or otherwise, the basic tenants of Darwin's original ideas for the evolution of the species remains sound, and it is the only viable theory of evolution. If anything, it has solidified its standing as a durable and accurate theory of evolution."
books,,5.0,Great book!,"I love this book. Dinesh writes many useful things in this book. Some things are even funny. Like his pamphlet ideas.

My 7 yr. old 2d grader loves this book but so do I as a writer and teacher. My son finds it easily understandable and it is written in such a way it is fun for him to use. As a result he is far ahead of most children his age in his writing skills.

books,9 of 11,5.0,A Old/New Fan Of The Horror Master!,"I just read this book, (in one sitting)!  A must read for fans.  This book chronicles King's work up to late last year ('98).  It almost reads like a novel itself.  I was absorbed by Beahm's willingness to focus on King's  work and not his private life (something he makes note of in the book).   You'll get a feel for where King has come from and how he's evolving.   Beahm even chronicles the movies (most of which don't do justice to the  books). My only complaint is the short stories in the collections were  sparsely reviewed.  If your looking for a &quot;biography&quot; this isn't  it!!"
books,3 of 47,1.0,shoddy thinking,"The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published"
books,28 of 29,4.0,"More entertainment, less of a serious introduction","This slender volume reads fast.  A comprehensive study of Italian culture is beyond the scope of this book.  The authors have arranged 74 brief &quot;points&quot; about daily life in Italy, alphabetically by subject, so the reader doesn't know what is coming next.  If you look at the sample pages available here, you will get a sense of the leaps: we begin with an explanation of the Italian version of April Fool's Day, followed by four paragraphs on table manners, and then we're on to &quot;attracting attention,&quot; and so on.  From the very way it's organized, we are clearly in the realm of entertainment, although the information is accurate and certainly useful.  There is a dusting of vocabulary, but it's not a course in Italian for travellers.  I found it a delightful and fascinating read"
books,2 of 14,5.0,And The Boys In The Band Played On,"The sexual revolution is over, wrote an old revolutionist named P.J. O'Rourke, and the microbes won.  This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war."
books,3 of 6,4.0,The Information Age can Help even You,"I picked up this book, after running into my ex-fiance five years after the fact. I have been struggling with gender role issues longer than I care to admit-I turned 50 this year. To my amazement, I learned some things that I can't apply to a male/female relationship at this time (i'm not in one), but is helping with the most difficult relationship I have-with my adopted mother who is my complete opposite. I learned that although she is a career woman, she still has a more traditional mindset than I. If you are a busy person, and you don't get the whole book read, the first three chapters may change your life significantly"
books,1 of 1,5.0,A Must have for Far Side Fans,"I laughed when the cartoons were new, and I am still laughing at them.  Gary Larson had a rare gift for creating humor that could border on the bizarre, but was always novel and fresh.  The cartoons are arranged by the year they were first published.  The only downside is the heft of the volumes, so they don't make easy bed time reading"

Many others have failed to teach us about debt and credit card management in a language we could relate to.  This book not only teaches but guides you along the way.  Intimidation of debt management and saving money is not a factor anymore, thanks to the author. It opened my eyes to many things I didn't know, or should already have knowledge of but could never understand. This book has encouraged me to take charge of my financial management and I now subscribe to the Debtsmart Newsletter, to keep the educational process going. I enjoyed the book tremendously and highly recommend it"
books,8 of 27,1.0,Censorship?,"""Lies Across America"" is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Disguised behind this book's apparently innocuous political correctness lies a new form of pernicious censorship.  Even though the author claims that he has no intent to rip down monuments, much of his reasoning is deeply flawed.  Instead of doing original research into the various subjects that he writes on, like a good professor should do, he summarizes a book, says it presents correct conclusions, and then says that the old thinking is wrong.  Case in point, is the chapter on the burning of Columbia, South Carolina during the Civil War.  Instead of looking at all the evidence on what happened when Sherman marched into the city in 1865, Loewen quotes two books which he seems to think draw the correct conclusions, and says that Sherman really had nothing to do with burning the city.  Thus, almost all the historical markers in Columbia are wrong, or so Loewen seems to hold.  Not the most convincing argument."

books,0 of 1,5.0,Another great book by Ms. Brockmann,"Ms. Brockmann is absolutely one of my top 3 authors. This book delivers another great combination of story lines and characters. The current and former members of Seal Team 16 are revisited and in fact pitted against each other. This book focuses on Mark Jenkins, who has only been peripherally involved in some of the other books in this series. Also, there is a new installment on the relationship between Sophia Ghafari and Lawrence Decker who were the focus of a previous book."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Last Days of Summer,This is a great book i recommened for anyone in the 8th grade or in high school.  I read this book because the cover and tittle sounded good but i read the first letter to Charlie Banks and I was hooked if you dont read the entire book you will miss it so don't just try spark notes read the book.

books,3 of 4,4.0,Excellent concept; a bit repetitive,"This book offers a great way to approach difficult conversations.  There are several templates in the book to show the reader how to do this.  However, after reading it, it does tend to repeat certain aspects of the material.  I am sure that some of that is for effect; but for someone who is capable of applying material quickly it can be somewhat boring.  I still recommend it as a read, but I do not recommend that you need to completely read the book to get the overall message"
books,2 of 2,4.0,a good fun read,"I first came across Dr. Shahi's interesting ideas on biobusiness when I heard him speak at a conference a few months ago. His presentation created a bit of a buzz. In subsequent discussions, several attendees strongly recommended this book."
books,,5.0,A Great Handbook for Lifestyle Change,"I purchased this book for my dad when he discovered his cholesterol and blood pressure were a little high.  I tried to find a lifestyle book rather than a ""recipe"" book.  This has some great recipe ideas, but is more focused on trading in bad habits for good ones.  My recently retired father can't keep his hands out of this book -- he loves it"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Excellent book,"This book hits home for me as my mom has been in a nursing home for seven years.  Ms. Macomber has hit the nail on the head as the role reversal scenes play themselves out.  I hope those who will be going through that phase of life will take notes and be prepared for it.  It's not an easy task but it a rewarding one.  Thank you, Ms. Macomber"

For debt, we call this &quot;interest&quot;, and for equity, we call it &quot;yield&quot;.  Homer's book is the superbly recorded history of this phenomenon.  Perhaps its greatest value is that when you hear or read a new theory, you can assess its validity by comparing the theory's  implications with the historical evidence"
books,,5.0,A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander),Another great book in the series! I couldn't put it down! It has a few slow spots but well worth the time in the end.
books,1 of 2,5.0,Leave Room In Your Life For The Absurd,"Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own."
books,5 of 6,4.0,"Not as good as the original, but....","still a highly readable, fact filled work on the Nazi's in power from 1933-39.  The book is not chronological; rather, Evans breaks up the chapters to deal with individual topics.  At times, this was frustrating because you may lose what else was going on at that time until 200 pages later.  On the other hand, it was also good because it allowed the reader to focus on individual topics and learn more and more about them.  The best details were the mini-biographies that Evans wrote about several key figures during this time.  These were very informative and easy to read.  Another great part was the details on the Strength Through Joy program.  This write up was very fascinating.  The last chapters on Hitler's attempts to prepare for war and acquire areas such as Austria was very well written and interesting as well.  I would have given this book 5 stars based on sheer information, but I only give it 4 because some chapters were not all that interesting and the non-chronological aspect got in the way at times.  Still, despite any negatives, the readability, research, and information is well worth the price and the time it takes to read a book this massive.  Even the most well read student of WWII and/or Nazi Germany will find some interesting information in this book."
books,11 of 12,4.0,not your usual historical perspective,"If you prefer your history to be the story of human beings, their struggles, and their triumphs, this book will disappoint. Cronon presents the history of Chicago and the midwest as the history of commodities and  trade. It's an interesting approach, and he shows the global implications  of many of his insights-- he correctly observes that much of what he  demonstrates with Chicago could also be shown with other cities as well.  Some of his insights didn't strike me as being nearly as unexpected as he  seems to think they are (the interdependence on commodities wholesalers and  their markets, for example), but most of his ideas are well-argued and  supported. Ultimately this is not so much about Chicago's history as it is  about using Chicago and the west as a case study to show how cities grow,  and how city and country are inter-related"
books,4 of 4,4.0,Happy with Purchase,"I am a huge fan of David Sedaris' writings. When I saw he had an audio CD, I was more curious than anything to buy it. The comedic timing of Sedaris is something you don't get just by reading. To hear the stories as the author intended them for you to read them is insight to the stories on another level.I also enjoyed the Q&A section of the disc, even though it is brief.  All of the tracks can be found in his books, so there is nothing really new on the CD for the devoted fans. Still, funny as anything and a great thing to listen to in the car."

This book exceeds expectations.  I recommend it to all ages.  If you like humor, a fine plot deftly woven, beautifully written prose with a philosophically rich sub plot this book is for YOU"
books,,4.0,Great for a chick-lit!,"Ok, yes, this isn't the next great American novel.  However this book is a great chick-lit to read when you're missing your best friend or if you just want to live the virtual life of someone on the NYC social scene.  Similar, yes, to The Devils Wears Prada but different enough to not have you guessing every beat of the book."
books,0 of 4,1.0,Not Funny,"I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did"
books,4 of 5,2.0,Just an Over-rated Mediocre Mystery,"At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a ""well isn't that contrite"" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight."

books,3 of 4,5.0,WOW,"I've read all the ""In Death"" books published so far and I have to say that ""Conspiracy in Death"" is my favorite.

Yahoo JD Robb (aka Nora Roberts)!"
books,4 of 6,5.0,Glorious view of imperial Japan,"For a Japanese nationalist, Yukio Mishima seems to have had an appreciation for European literature, as demonstrated in his wonderful novel ""Spring Snow,"" the first part of a tetralogy.  Taking place in Tokyo in the years following the Russo-Japanese war and just before the first world war, it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed nineteenth-century epic with an almost Tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a Stendhalian romance.  Appropriately, one of its themes is the gradual influx of Western influence on Japanese culture, which Mishima, himself loyal to the Samurai tradition, might well have resisted."
books,1 of 8,2.0,Disappointing!,"I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say."

books,4 of 5,5.0,a  book to read as a youngster or an oldster,"I first read this book at about age 12.  That period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man's best friend, so I was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup, took his dog, and drove around the United States. It didn't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an ""old guy"".  He shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill.  You want to grab a sleeping bag, some grub, and hit the road.  At that time, I was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in Steinbeck's camper.  It would be a few years before I saw the movies ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath"", which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who John Steinbeck was and what he was about.  In ""Travels With Charley"" the reader doesn't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of Steinbeck's fiction.  In this book Steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man, like Andy Rooney.  Now that I'm getting kind of old myself, I find myself experiencing the changes in the world Steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book.  When he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer, you get the willies along with Steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea, manned by the very young, protecting us, yet at the same time menacing.  The first time I read his description of the waitress in the diner in Maine, so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy, I had never met that kind of person before.  Since then I have worked with many just like her.  My favorite part was when Steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in Maine.  Also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous ""top 40"" songs on the radio, last generation's castoffs as today's antiques, and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place.  Steinbeck got road-weary halfway through the book, his dog got sick, and everything seemed wrong.  He witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early '60s.  The badlands and the South creeped him out, and he couldn't wait to get back home.  Isn't that just the way a real trip works?"
books,14 of 30,4.0,Outdated. Can better be understood as polemics with Galbraith,"This book probably should not be treated as ""capitalist manifesto"" a la Marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous Galbraith ""The Affluent Society"" (1958). Reading the book without reading Galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) style. But as a polemic with Galbraith vision of post-capitalism (post-industrial society) the book looks like an interesting historical document."
books,8 of 19,2.0,"OK, but boring","I agree with the premises of this book, but found it rather boring, and not the easiest to read. If you want to read something similar that doesn't read like a textbook, I would suggest ""Losing Faith in Faith"", ""Atheist Universe"" or ""Like Rolling Uphill."""

books,8 of 10,5.0,"Pure History, Little Insight","Sidney Homer delivers what he promised - a lengthy and extremely detailed history of interest rates.  Almost completely absent is any commentary on why interest rates have changed through history.  Any observations of cause and effect are left up to the reader to discern.  But as a pure history text, the book is readable and thorough both in breadth and depth"
books,3 of 4,4.0,Imagery that whips like lightning,"Yukio Mishima is, sadly, known best for the circumstances of his death. He committed seppuku (ritual suicide by sword) after finishing the final book of this tetralogy--The Sea of Fertility. He, along with Kawabata and Murakami, is one of the most prominent Japanese authors that actually gained attention during his life. Mishima was called a radical, a right-winger. Some think that this stigma affects his writing greatly, but hearing someone say that makes me wonder why they're reading him to begin with."
books,,5.0,Wonderful,"Grain, beef, and lumber. Chicago became what it became not only because of its location on the Great Lakes/railroad sytem, but also because of these resources. This book shows how much nature influences human efforts. It has  few personalities because the exploitation of the resources was inevitable.   This is a great book for a greater understanding of how nature drives  humanity"
books,0 of 1,4.0,The usual brilliance with a soggy end,"It's no denying Peter Carey is a brilliant writer. His flair for pin-pointing the nuances of the good old Aussie vernacular is spot-on, and his characters are always society's off-cuts, but ultimately likeable souls.  Theft: A Love Story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read. But unlike his brilliant True History of the Kelly Gang, it seems that Carey wasn't sure how to end this wonderful tale, and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning"
books,,5.0,Artemis Fowl - The Arctic Incident Pleases Both Listener And Reader,"After listening to a public library audiobook copy of the first Artemis Fowl (Artemis Fowl), my children and I were eager to see if there were other books available in the series.  We learned that our library did not have subsequent copies, so I hurried to Amazon to see what I could find.  We've now purchased and listened to ""Artemis Fowl - The Arctic Incident"" and have donated it to our public library so others may share in the story.  Not only is each book in the series wonderfully written, with fully crafted, believable characters - insofar as fairy-tale characters can be believable - but the audiobook is narrated by one of the most skillful readers I've ever heard.  Nathaniel Parker, also the narrator for the first book, is back with his fantastic portrayals of our favorite characters.  This book has all the necessary ingredients for enjoyment:  comedy, adventure, fantasy - all played out through witty and engaging dialog between easily distinguishable characters.  The author, Eoin Colfer, must have been a Monty Python fan too, because some of the lines uttered as asides by a couple of his characters could just as likely have been said by one of the Flying Circus troupe.  My family highly recommends this book, in either printed or audio form"
books,3 of 3,1.0,"The ""Four Year"" Yawn","I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words ""four years"" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Paradise!,"With the chilly season setting in here in Washington State, the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long.  I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there.  This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader."
books,1 of 5,5.0,Simply the general overview on investing in Equities,"I read everything that Jeremy writes.  He is simply the best researcher on equity investing alive today.  Every fact in the book is extremely well researched, I imagine helped out by a team of eager finance students at Wharton, the best finance school in the world.  This book gives even novice investors a very readable broad based knowledge set for investing.  It also proves that equities should be the foundation of everyones long term investment portfolio.  His other more recent book The Future for Investors is also a must read.  I have bought both of these books for everyone in my family and have told them if they want to build wealth they will read these books"
books,8 of 12,5.0,Making sense of senseless cruelty,"Those so called ""professionals"" of the cottage industry called ""childhood sexual abuse"" should be forced to read this book before lunging foward to ""save"" more kids.  The witch hunt we've seen in this nation makes Salem look like a tea party.  Beautifully written, well researched, heartbreakingly fair - the enemies of critical thought and careful observation will hate this book"
books,8 of 51,1.0,Goes against God,"I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me.  It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible.  If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge.  I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire."

Does she overplay her hand or is she merely telling it as it is?  Are Europe's leaders, especially in her native Italy, biased towards Muslim sympathies in opposition to Christian values?  An argument not likely to be considered by Muslims or their leaders, though the Muslim side should take note that: 1.  opposing and contrary views are inherent to the Western tradition, and 2. many non-Muslims in the West remain skeptical about Muslim claims to be a religion of peace, while their mullahs propagate ingorance and hateful attitudes to non-Muslims; that women are accorded merely partial human rights, depending on the degree of fundamentalist view; and that violent terrorism is an acceptable form of mediating political and social ""grievances"""

Several of  my friends, including my parents and my in-laws will be receiving their own  copy of this wonderful historical treasure.

She has introduced to me to classics, to modern day litature, and some crud books. I learned what to pick from her. I know what to read. When she introduced this book to me, I had no prior knowledge about the author, James Frey. For all I knew, it was a ""drug"" book. After my mother had finished it, She gave it to me to read. I was skeptical about it. I felt that I could not read it, because it didn't sound intresting. It was a story of a man that defines rock bottom. He wakes up on a plane, covered in body fluids, and has a hole in his cheek which he has no recollection of getting it. He is then taken to a rehababilitation facility, where he detoxs and thinks about life. He then meets love and finds himself there. It is a uplifting story."
books,1 of 1,5.0,well worth the time and thought,"Working in and with groups and, at the same time, making progress can be an incredibly complex experience.  This book, though it demands a disciplined and thoughtful effort, will make a profound difference by its use.  Having seen the principles of this work in action, groups are healthier and far more productive toward their charter.  Members discover the patience to listen and the courage to contribute to others; results that make choosing this path quite worthy."

I also spoke to a friend of mine who works in a large law firm (100+) attorneys in Milwaukee.  He told me that the attorneys in the IP department in this prestigious firm use this book as a reference.  I think that speaks quite highly of the book.  I strongly recommend it
books,8 of 8,5.0,This book is the real deal!,"For those who say this book is boring and has too many rules, I would ask: if all the 10,000 books out there full of glossy photos and little explanation were all that helpful, why did you need to buy this book in the first place? Decorating is like any other creative profession; the foundation of the ""magic"" that a good decorator can provide actually consists of basic principles that can be learned by anyone. Oh, and I think the reason some of the photos appear dated is that we are used to seeing design books incorporating the latest trends. She used photos of real homes, which, I'm sure, contained furniture that the owners had been collecting for years. That's kind of the point of this book."

books,4 of 4,5.0,FABULOUS!,"I read this to my 8 and 6 year old at bed time.  It was so enjoyable for all of us that we couldn't wait to get back to it each night.  The story does such a great job of explaining how Peter became who he is.  The kids were both crying last night when we finished it - appropriately sad that Peter, having to remain a boy forever, would miss out on the same life his aging friends would have.  I thought it was great that they both got the emotion of the goodbyes."

books,2 of 12,1.0,"Very, Very Bland","I'm not really a big of Grant Morrison's work. I find a lot of his work to be the kind of stuff I thought up and then decided does have enough depth to carry it in a story. With that said, Invisibles takes the cake when it comes to that. While it may be different, that doesn't mean it has any depth. If you're a fan of Morrison's, go do yourself a favor and read the Seven Soldiers trades or his Arkham Asylum stuff but stay away from the Invisibles"
books,6 of 12,1.0,I had a bad feeling about this!  And I was right!,"I was intrigued by the title, which supposedly links Jedi wisdom to Christianity.  Well, after 60 pages or so, I have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the difficulty in leading a Christian life.  But, I say that any religious life (be it Christian, Islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional."
books,,5.0,A must read for a sociologist/criminologist,"As a criminologist, I have a small library of books that range from sociological and crim theory to true crime and collective behavior and no book as given me more pleasure than this one.  The research is impeccable and there are so many passages that will never find their way into a textbook, so it is now my goal to utilize this work by incorporating it into my lectures.  This is a must read for anyone interested history, the impact of the industrial revolution on society and a study of the criminal mind in creating the victim-offender relationship.    Bravo to Mr. Larson."

books,,4.0,Sleeping With Fear!!,I have to say I agree with most of the other reviews.. Kay Hooper is one of a verrrry few authors I buy in hardback.. I was dissapionted in the book.. Where were the agents with their psychic abilities.. It was hard to follow where Riley was going. The ending seems a bit thrown together.. I mean her and Ash were talking one min and the next she was off in a Hummer..I like what she tried to do with the book but I think she fell short.. It seems to me Kay Hooper was not able to write the amnesia well into the story at all.. I sure hope the next book is better I think I will wait for it in paperback

This book is great!  I cant really add anymore than what others have added here, but I can say please read this book, everyone should have this information under their belts.  I would however recommend reading The Beautiful side of evil.  Like many they are unable to see the reality of satan's plans to get us off into something that can be so destructive and even move us out of God's truth.  See how this women was fooled into thinking something she was doing was from God and then how God reveals the truth to her.  Much the same about Garry's book, who by the way I have personally met.  The only difference between the 2 books is the story it tells"
books,5 of 6,4.0,"Very, very interesting","This book was someone else's bookclub selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, ""stock"" phrases, and ""hanging"" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However, I found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  I found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  I also liked Dr. Temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  Great idea! Although the book really goes all over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my ""seeking/hunting"" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Let the gay publishing boom begin!,"Geography Club by Brent Hartinger is the story of Russell Middlebrook, a gay 16 year old, who is negotiating the dog-eat-dog world of high school popularity.  He is also firmly and solidly in the closet at the beginning of this book and over the course of the novel the reader explores the pitfalls, dangers, and excitements of being a high schooler and being gay.  Hartinger locates Russell's' story in the social borderlands; he is not super popular nor is he reviled, and he is smart and snarky, but very insecure.  When rumors of a gay kid and a gay club start to swirl at Goodkind High, Russell is finally starting to feel good about himself and rise up the popularity ranks thanks to the influence of his closeted jock boyfriend.  This leaves Russell to make difficult decisions that will resonate with any reader who feels or felt like an outsider in high school."

Aside from the thesis that a profit motive can be the driver for economic growth, improving the capabilities and lives of the poorest it also shows that developing economies does not equal low technological maturity or lack of opportunities to innovate with business models, distribution channels, product development or business processes.Having grown up and worked in India in the mid 90s it was clear that this kind of thinking and business models were not actively pursued."

True, they are discursive--but wonderfully so, and ""Crack"" more than most.

My 7 year old daughter, who has loved the story of ""Peter Pan"" since she was little, was completely enthralled chosing to read over any other activity just to find out what happens next.  Each chapter leaves you hanging just enough that you can't wait to read on...and on...and on!  The descriptions are great, too.  I teach writing to third graders and there are excellent descriptive paragraphs that I would love to share with them to show them just how descriptive and creative you can be!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a wonderful adventure. The fact that it's a story about Peter Pan and the founding of Never Land is almost secondary to the action."

It's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that Bush would have won anyway. Palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up. But Palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote, and the votes that were not counted."

books,3 of 3,5.0,great book for new people to chicago,"uptown, oldtown, gold coast, north side.....sometimes it seems like Chicagoland has another name for every area.  This book is great.  Just what I needed to explore the areas of Chicago.  It's organised by areas and lists all of the different things from restaurants to  theatres to laundry mats in the area.  The maps are very clear and easy to read.  Excellent book for people who've just moved to Chicago (and aren't after the touristy things).  I think it's equally useful for people who live in the 'burbs and downtown dwellers.  Highly recommended"

The authors present a chronology of Kay Francis' life based on her diaries and other extensive research.  Kear & Rossman provide intimate details of her life in an unbiased and thoughtful manner.  The authors were able to convey their love of Kay thru the book.  We receive a glimpse into the life of a Hollywood actress in the 20s & 30s.  This book will appeal to people interested in Kay Francis and Hollywood.  I enjoyed it because it shows the individuality of Kay Francis.  Her charity work, midwestern values, sexual encounters, and career are all presented in the book.  The pictures were great and interesting."

But, there was still the element of surprise as to how everything would turn out, etc.  It seemed like a hopeless situation when I realized the perpetrator.  I listened to the audio version of this book.  I usually only listen to audio books as I walk.  However, when I got to the point of finding our who the hit and run driver was, I couldn't stop listening.  I listened to the last two cassettes non-stop all morning long.  If I had been reading it, it would have been a true page turner until I reached the end.  I recommend this story highly.  It is different than The Notebook and The Wedding, and I applaud Nicholas Sparks as a writer"

books,13 of 35,2.0,It takes an egotist to know one,"Podhoretz, the man who recently said what's the big deal about a few thousand dead G.I.'s in Iraq considering what's at stake (without having a clue that nothing is at stake), Norman disparages the artist/intellectual/egotists of the 60's/70's that don't fall in line with his ideology while today he lauds the conservative egomaniacs that have brought our country to its low level of intellectualism and turned a nation founded by intellectual deists into a Disneyworld of McReligion.  But it's all fine so long as we make the world safe for democracy.  Norman seems to think there is something hypocritical about professing social justice and being a small time celebrity, when in fact, as Freud said, the partial motivation of any ""artist"" is fame and the love of women (speaking I assume of male artists). Einstein enjoyed the limelight; everyone enjoys the limelight and everyone has his or her weaknesses.  Have you ever read Einstein's poetry?  YUK!  So to disparage the ones you don't happen to like is a bit disingenuous.  The true irony is that only an attention-seeking egotist would write a book about such trivial nonsense.  But this is all in keeping with a man who explains what writers should be writing if they only knew better, ex., he applauded James Baldwin's early career because he was on his way to being another Henry James; he condemns him when Baldwin's attention turned to racism in America.  Imagine that: a black writer distraught over racism in America.  The very idea! I think Norm's whole problem can be traced back to his youth, which he relates in his autobiography ""Making It,"" talking about taking the subway from culturally challenged Brooklyn to Manhattan, growing up as a nice Jewish boy, the son of modest working class parents, attending college, and rising among the ranks of the intellectual New York crowd. Nowadays, Norm is comparing the invasion of Iraq to the invasion of Normandy, and explains that Iraq will become democratic by using as an analogy post-WW II  Germany's quick transition to a modern democracy (of course, with the help of 2 1/2 million allied troops occupying it).  How did this guy ever have friends to begin with??"

books,10 of 11,5.0,I'VE ENJOYED THIS ONE OVER THE YEARS,"First I must admit to a certain bias here.  I travel a lot, I travel with a dog as a companion and I enjoy reading this particular author. I was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date. I can relate to this work!  That being said, this is one of those books that I have reread several times over the years, and year after year, I find that Steinbeck's observations contunue to be relevant.  This is a very easy reading book.  I do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though, that this is NOT a novel(despite what his son said)!  It is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author's eyes.  It is interpreted through the author's past expierences and how he preceives the world.  I am sure that any ten (or one hundred) people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten (or one hundred) different stories and interpretations of those stories. I shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations...others I did not.  That is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read, or better yet, talk to others, and agree or disagree, enjoy their views.  I certainly cannot fault the author's usage of language, syntax and organization.  It is all good solid Steinbeck. This is one of those books that can be read on several levels.  You can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in America, or, as I do, you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author.  As a side note:  I do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring.  I can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies, T.V. etc. of this day and age.  I might suggest though, that you give it another read in a few years.  Perhaps you will look at it differently.  I know I have expierence that with other works by different authors.  All in all, recommend this one highly."
books,12 of 12,5.0,The first book you should get,"In the delivery room when my son Mikey was born, we were told he had Down syndrome. We knew very little about the condition and were confused and frightened about the future. Our son's geneticist gave us a copy of this book and it answered almost all of our questions, including some we never thought to ask. The information in this book relieved many of our fears and showed us how to be the best parents for our son. The book starts with a forward by Ann M. Forts, a member of the Board of Directors of the National Down Syndrome Congress; the New Hampshire Developmental Disabilities Council; and the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. Ms. Forts also happens to be a person with Down syndrome. Right away, we knew this book was going to be positive! The book starts with a chapter on what is Down syndrome followed by a chapter on adjusting to your new child. Chapter 3 discusses some of the medical issues that are associated with Down syndrome. This is good information to be aware of even if you never need it. The next few chapters discuss taking care of your baby, family life, how your baby will develop, early intervention, and educating the child with Down syndrome. The last chapter covers your legal rights. Every chapter has several pages of short quotes from parents. It helped to lessen the fear and stress to read that other parents are coping. This is by far the best book for the new parent of a child with Down syndrome. Before you read anything else, you will want to read this book"

books,1 of 1,5.0,"A Must Read, even if I was mentioned in the book!","The class that Michael speaks about with the career change students was mine.  He strolls in I think on Day 2 of K-18 with Chef Theo Roe.  We were told about him coming and being an active participant in our class but mostly would stay out of the way and ask questions for an up coming project.  He hung with us for a couple of days and we all enjoyed sitting around the dinner table talking about ourselves and he enlightening us with his journey and interaction with Chef Pardus, who at the time we were not assigned but did eventially get him.  He stayed in touch with me mostly wanting updates of my CIA class clear through graduation.  I see him on tv now with the likes of Anthony Bourdain, Tom Keller and his own show.  This book, if you read the first one, goes to show how deep food cuts into the ""Soul of a Chef.""  He has written other things, pediatric surgery with his sister the surgeon, wooden boats and he always comes back to food.  He cretainly has my diagnosis of Soul of a Chef.  Thanks Michael for 1st of all putting my name in the book, but also brining to light the CIA in the time I went through. It was a wonderful time in my life and I know the others felt the same.  Good luck and buy this book if you are reading this review!  Reach of a Chef - Buy It"
books,5 of 6,4.0,Insightful.,"Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on"
books,,5.0,an interesting introduction to conservative thought but only an introduction,"I read this book to learn about conservative thought. Although not a conservative myself I was interested in learning what the other half thinks. I believe I have made a start in this but only a start. The chapters in this book are short introductions to facets of conservative thought such as opposition to big government and opposition to affirmative action except for the authors support of socio economic affirmative action. Throughout, the philosophy of conservative thinking such as the belief that traditional values should be upheld is espoused. I believe I got a good introduction to conservative thinking from this book. As an added bonus the author lists books for further reading at the end of the book. Although this book has not changed my underlying moderate philosophy it has made me think. It is interesting how people can take the same set of data and come to different conclusions about it. D'Souza thinks that the increasing gap between the rich and the poor is a sign of progress in that there are more rich people while liberals are worried about it's consequences. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn about conservative thinking."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Insights on knowing your knowledge workers,"This is a fine, occasionally frustrating book. It is frustrating for the same reason that it is so badly needed: business is just starting to figure out what it means to compete in a knowledge-based economy. Knowledge work is tremendously important, but only partially understood. This volume, which mixes practical advice with worksite studies, is a good stepping stone toward comprehending knowledge work and the people who accomplish it. Author Thomas H. Davenport is honest enough to admit what isn't known, however he delivers what is known clearly. He explains various organizational schema that are applicable, but not rigid. He provides examples, sharing personal and organizational stories that illustrate both success and failure in knowledge work. We warmly recommend this book to knowledge workers, those who manage knowledge workers and business leaders who are planning for the future."

books,8 of 9,4.0,Not exactly things that you can do in your off hours,"The ""How to"" in the title is deceptive. This isn't yet another book that advises you to conserve electricity in your home, or to donate to charities, or to volunteer at local homeless shelters. This is effectively a collection of short nonfiction stories telling about many personal accounts of social entrepreneurs: the sort of people who devote their entire lives to actually *go out there* to make changes happen, who create organizations, not people who just support organizations. These are stories about people who actually went out and helped construct solar panels to bring electricity to rural Brazil, people who actually run a street-youth safety hotline in India. These are in a very different league from things like conserving water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth. These aren't things that anybody can just do in their spare time. A lot of the cases of social entrepreneurship described in this book are things I haven't even heard of before. There are grayscale photos of the people and events. There's a lot of statistics. Both defeats and victories are described. This seems to be a college textbook, not light reading. At the back are extensive lists of reference websites."
books,,4.0,okay,"yes, the writer seems to repeat herself a lot in the story. i almost thought there were only two characters after reading the first 100 pages. but then it grew better, and even more appealing towards the last 100 pages. it is a decent novel, and i'm glad i read it. it is not as thought-provoking as the two novels of anita shreve i read, but i certainly enjoyed the reading"
books,,5.0,If you have any sort of an interest in art...,Then you will absolutely fall in love with this book. This book is full of images from a wide range of media and artists. The short bios on the artists are short but informative and don't take up much space (more room for pictures). If you're something of an artist yourself then you can certainly pull lots of ideas from this book. I definitely am glad I bought this book
books,,4.0,Nothing Earth Shaking...but a good read!,"I read this book in about 6 hours.  It is an easy, if predictable, read.  Doesn't delve into the whole AIDS topic too deeply, but it is always a thread throughout.  Ava is a likeable character, as is her sister.  The romance sub-plot is VERY predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless."
books,6 of 7,5.0,A special gift sparks changes and tragedy,"Lynne Hinton's The Things I Know Best is set in North Carolina, where a home which has housed generations of the Ivy women is affected by a special gift which sparks changes and tragedy.

books,3 of 5,5.0,"Can I get an ""Amen!""??","McDonald's is one of the great symbols of America, and most countries around the world absolutely love McDonald's.  If you want to know the history of the mega-giant corporation, this is a good starting place.  We are capitalists in America - we love making money, and that can only be considered a good thing.  McDonald's embodies much of the American spirit and American dream.  Sure, the food isn't healthy - as if that's a newflash for anyone these days.  But eating it in moderation is not harmful in any way.  Oh, and westcoaster (below) didn't actually read this book prior to reviewing it - that person just has a problem with successful business-people earning money.  If you don't have that problem, read the book and marvel at the entrepreneurial spirit.  And to Hades with the naysayers - come to think of it, I'm outta here - gotta grab a Quarter Pounder with cheese, baby"

books,3 of 3,5.0,The stuff of dreams and nightmares,"Twenty years ago the sudden appearance of a nervous looking young security guard at the door of my office nearly gave me a heart attack. It was three in the morning, the hospital's ninth floor (the non-patient biophysics department) was otherwise completely dark and empty, and I'd been laughing so hard that I hadn't heard the security guard walk up to my door. When I looked up and saw him, the shock was like a cattle prod to the solar plexus. The guard also looked sort of scared - when he'd gotten off the elevator on what was supposed to be an empty floor, he'd heard hysterical cackling coming down a dark corridor and was torn between duty and just getting back on the elevator and pretending to have heard nothing."

books,10 of 23,1.0,Grrr!,"Mars and Venus Together Forever is one of the most ridiculous, stupid books that I have ever had the gross misfortune to read.  I probably should have expected what I got, considering that Mars and Venus on a Date left me cold, but I read this one anyway because the original Mars and Venus book had SOME interesting insights and I'm a sucker for a cheap book."
books,4 of 5,5.0,An Opportunity for Profound Reflection,"I had read this book at the office (after reading the newer one Building the Bridge) and had to get my own copy. I've begun to do the exercises at the end of the chapter and find that it offers an opportunity for profound reflection on personal and workplace issues. This book has challenged me to read my own ""integrity meter"" and do the work to move in the right direction"
books,0 of 2,4.0,"A FERTILE, WELL-TILLED LAND","As China re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century, much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world. Oddly, the fascism of the Communist regime remains largely in place in the era following Mao's disastrous reign, even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge, heavily-populated, and (from a Western perspective)oftentimes strange land. Aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of Christianity in China, as well as introducing readers to the many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country. On a recent trip to China, I was highly impressed by the deep generosity, humility, resourcefulness, strength, perseverance, and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all ages. This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith. This spirit is also, I believe, one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many Chinese. Also, those who are concerned that a ""Christian China"" would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a Westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy. It seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly Chinese way"
books,19 of 22,4.0,Good but lacks mathematical rigor,I read all three of these books over a six month period. They are a fairly comprehensive study of college level physics at a beginning to intermediate level. The most through treatment is given to the subject of Electromagnetism.
books,2 of 2,5.0,Highly Recommended,"In this hectic world it is critical to have the most essential information concentrated into a fun and easy to digest form.  Everyone has opinions and advice when it comes to babies, but this book extracts the most valuable pearls of wisdom from the experts whe know best.  I just ordered copies to give as gifts to all of my friends who have young ones or are soon expecting.  Thanks to Samantha Ettus for keeping experts advice coming our way!!!"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Entertaining account of two seminal cultural figures of the '60's,"Howard Cosell and Muhammad Ali are American icons.

books,7 of 13,5.0,The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot,This was by far the most informational book I have ever read on conservatism. I learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism. Also this book is very practicle and worthwhile. No hype just fact and purpose. Anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking.
books,,5.0,A child's classic,"This, with Goodnight Moon by the same authors, is a classic children's book, and with good reason. It's a nice story with a repeating structure and pattern that children enjoy and beautiful, colorful, two-page spread pictures that catch even the eyes of my 5-week-old son"
books,0 of 3,1.0,Where's the story?,I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted.  The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc.  Very disappointed
books,6 of 7,5.0,Beautiful and inspiring,Wow! I just got it and this book is beautiful and what amazing women.  I am so excited to buy this as gifts for my friends who are in that age range but also just my female friends who are making it up in this world like some of the women in the book.  The photos are awesome and it is also inspirational to read each of their stories.  Definitely one to keep out on the coffee table for when guests come over

Billy muzzles the wolf and pulls it by horseback into Mexico to set it free.  As is the course of things, Fate eventually separates the two, and the wolf ends up in a ring baited by dogs.  Billy delivers a mercy killing in a moving scene -- as the bloodied wolf is held by the collar up against his leg, the crowd looks on.  He trades his rifle for the dead wolf's pelt -- ""I don't reckon I know exactly why"" -- and heads back to the States, where he finds his home and life have changed forever. . ."

books,,4.0,Classic Baseball Novel,"A simple, predictable, yet powerful story of an old-school pitcher, Shaara's novel is a classic baseball tale.  Billy Chapel, a future Hall-of-Famer who has just learned of his trade after 17 years with the same club, decides to hang up his cleats rather than leave the team he loves.  He is not interested in money (yes, this is an obvious work of fiction), and pitches primarily for his ""love of the game."""
books,5 of 12,5.0,Something to think about,This book is short and to the point.  Mr. Arnold states his theory and then backs it up with research. He describes the problem that is comming then he tells you what you should do
books,,5.0,"Honest, lucid, well-researched","This biography has a flow that pulls you in. I was surprised by some of the revelations, such as the complexity of internal politics he had to deal with. It gives an image of an honest, ambitious, great leader. A leader who himself is unsure of many things (such as the civil war). Recommended"
books,9 of 9,5.0,Fantastic & easy recipes! Very comfortable.,"First off, you just can't top Jacques Pepin- he just makes you comfortable about cooking no matter your skill level. I bought this book after watching his PBS ""Fast Food My Way"" series. All of the recipes are easy and quick. Many of them can be done with things you already buy most of the time and he often tells you items that can be supplemented. For example, the ""Instant Vegetable Soup"" (which is awesome) lists one defined recipe but the accompanying description tells you how it can be made into a variety of other, quick soups with things nearly always on-hand, like potatoes, onions, and cheese. The ""Tomato Tartare"" has become a weekly staple in my home- everyone loves it. ""Cilantro-Walnut Cod"", ""Egg & Tomato Gratin"", & ""Quick Tenderloin Stew"" were easy and turned out fabulously. The ""Warm Chocolate Cakes"" are the easiest I've ever made. This book isn't a mega-source of recipes but the ones that are in it are quality. I'm just an average home chef and have had a great experience with every recipe I've tried- all were easy and tasty. I only wish I could mince an onion like he does"
books,4 of 4,5.0,"Tenderly written, very moving story, superb character development, I loved it","I hardly ever cry when I read a book, but I did a couple of times when I read this one, just from the tender feelings and differences between mothers and daughters.  Not only did these families have the usual difficulties due to age disparity between young and old, but there was also the cultural differences between war-time China and the modern USA.  Sometimes it was very funny, and it was always spellbinding to me.  It made me feel closer both to Chinese people and to my mother and also my daughter, who's the same age as the daughters in this book"

books,,4.0,Where's The Actual Killer Hiding Out?,"The client came to Kinsey Millhone with an easy job she thought-deliver $25,000 to a fifteen-year-old kid. A little odd, and Kinsey wasn't sure what to make of this thing. So she takes Alvin Limardo's retainer check anyhow. It turns out that his real name is not Alvin Limardo, but John Daggett. And the check of course, is as phony as he is. John Daggett has a record as long as your arm and a reputation for sleazy deals. But he wasn't just a deadbeat. By the time Kinsey caught up with him, he was a dead body-with a whole host of people who were delighted to see him dead. There was four in particular that REALLY wanted him dead. Kinsey knew his death was no suicide-it was a plan to kill John. But which one of the four did it? Kinsey must put her detective skills to work and find out someone's secret"

books,21 of 22,5.0,Fresh Perspectives on Productivity,"In a sense, everyone must ""think for a living"" in response to questions, problems, opportunities, etc. Davenport focuses his attention on ""how to get better performance and results from knowledge workers"" and I presume to suggest that everyone involved in an organization's operations should be or helped to become  productive ""knowledge workers,"" whatever their specific duties and responsibilities may be. Those who have read any of Davenport's previous books -- notably Working Knowledge and Information Ecology co-authored with Laurence Prusak, The Attention Economy co-authored with John Beck, What's the Big Idea?, Mission Critical -- already know that Davenport is among the most perceptive and eloquent business thinkers on the subject of knowledge management. In my opinion, Thinking for a Living is his most valuable contribution to that subject thus far."

books,1 of 1,2.0,THIS ORCHID DOESN'T BLOSSOM,"After an impressive debut in ORCHID BEACH, we meet Holly Barker on her wedding day....a day that is destined to become a fateful day instead of a happy one.   Woods paints a picture of a heroine who seems more interesting in solving the bank robbery than mourning the loss of the man she supposedly wanted to spend the rest of her life with.  In a painfully dreadful narrative, Woods presents us with another variation on the extremist group of fanatics who want to make the US better by getting rid of anyone who isn't white.  Been done so many times before, that it's redundant in this tepid story.  Woods doesn't offer us anything new and the pacing is so slow, it becomes sleep inducing.  Woods also makes the mistake of having Ham, Holly's tough father, carry the weight of the book.  While Ham's an okay guy, he comes across as a Dirk Pitt or superman in this one, and it just didn't work for me.  The ending is also pretty lame, and even the inclusion of Stone Barrington, makes little narrative sense.  A real disappointment; is the third any better??"

books,38 of 40,4.0,Well written and informative,"Larry Mueller offers his unique way of speed training a bird dog, however, I do feel that his techniques are stressing to a dog - especially a sensitive dog or a young dog (say six-months).  Larry does offer some excellent ways to train your dog on the basic obedience/hunting commands, but his use of force training goes beyond my personal preference.  If you are a first-time trainer, training your own dog, this book is excellent - if you approach training with love and patience.  Remember, you are training a friend and companion, not a strickly business hunting dog"
books,8 of 13,5.0,I am enraged,"When I was eleven years old my father started to sexually abuse me. When I was fourteen my half-brother sexually abused me. I have remember the abuses every single day for 37 years - never forgetting for a moment what happened to me. Up until seven years ago I played the dutiful daughter in our ""happy little home"" until I finally got the guts to confront my father. Did he deny it - No, he admitted it. When I asked my older sister if our father (actually her step-father) had abused her she, too, said that she had remembered it everyday since the age of seven. Our father admitted to that, too. When I confronted my brother about the abuse, he admitted it too. But did I announce to the world every sick detail that happened to me. Did I cut myself off completely from my family. No - but at least I didn't have to pretend anymore that my father was this upstanding person. Now I didn't have to come up with lame excuses when I didn't go to family functions. Did it affect me - yes it did."
books,4 of 8,1.0,Total Garbage,"Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed"

books,,5.0,Definitely Worth the Read!,"This book is highly recommended by our church and all of our friends SWEAR by this method.  It is a little on the ""strict"" side, as far as scheduling goes.  We also read ""The Baby Whisperer"" (which is more relaxed- less rigid) and are planning to take what works for us from each book, as they both offer some great principles.  They both follow the same pattern routine of Eat, Activity, Sleep, then time for Mom & Dad."

Hiaasen's humor was incredible-I found myself laughing often. Even though the movie didn't cover as much ground as the book, I think the movie was much better than most people have let on.

books,4 of 6,2.0,Not really about changing the world,"This book has a great title, but somewhat lackluster content. The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world.  It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often"

It's wonderful! Easy to read, yet weighty in substance. Using biblical principles, David successfully shows a spiritually, mature integration of these principles and his faith with success and business workplace ethics.  Churches could also benefit from this refreshing viewpoint of &quot;doing business by the good book&quot; and note that this &quot;good book&quot; is just as good for religous business. I see this book being used to teach biblical ethics and for bible study and Sunday School (one lesson X 52 weeks)"
books,,4.0,A page-turning mystery read,"If you've read other Patterson mysteries and enjoyed them, you'll like this one, too.  There are no real surprises--this novel trods the well-worn mystery formula, but does so entertainingly.  Yes, there are legal bloopers, but people don't read novels like this to learn the law.  If you haven't read any Patterson, you'll probably like this if you like John Grisham, for instance.  These are plot-driven novels with not too much description or fine character development.  If you like Law & Order, you'll probably like this, too"

books,1 of 2,2.0,This book has a special place in my heart,"This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is ""deus ex machina"" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever"

And just when you think you have it all figured out, she surprises us with a twist at the very end.  As usual, you will know the characters so well that you will hate for the story to end"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Real History,"David McCullough does an outstanding job of presenting history as a living entity.  George Washington, among others, is portrayed as very human, i.e., not always knowing what to do or how to do it.  The supporting documentation is fantastic.  I wouldn't have thought that ordinary communications, e.g., letters from an ordinary soldier to his family, would still exist and be available to flesh out our understanding of events which were undoubtedly chaotic at the time.  This is not your usual history book, at least not like the history books that I read from elementary school through college."

books,,5.0,"Heartbreaking, haunting, beautiful","I must confess that I have only finished two of the short stories thus far but from the moment I read the dedication I suspected that I would not be dissapointed and have so far not.  I adored ""The Known World"" and find myself being at once drawn in and recoiling with Jones's writing:  the subject matter is often heartbreaking yet he writes with such confidence, beauty and clarity that I can't help but hunger for the next page.  I don't know that this book is for everyone (it isn't Tom Clancy or Stephen King if that is what you are looking for), but if you enjoyed ""The Known World"" or the writings of Toni Morrison, this is the book for you."

books,6 of 14,2.0,Disappointing!,"If you want to get introduced to the radical conservative concept in plain english you can probably read the book.

Actually just when you think you know what will come next, it doesn't, and a new spool unwinds.  It's quite imaginative and suspensfull.  Although I am not much into sci fi, this book is different - it will have a much wider audience.  It's well written and a quick read.  I highly recommend the book"
books,,5.0,A Great Story of an Amazing Family,As reviewed [...]
books,4 of 5,5.0,An excellent account of an American presidency,"I read this book with some skepticism at first since the initial reviews from the pundits were lukewarm. But I must admit, it is a riveting account of late 20th century American politics, and what it takes to rise to the top. Clinton's narration comes across in a natural, easygoing style, and it surprised me how deeply he thinks and feels about things that really matter. Those looking for juicy tidbits and meaningless chatter will be disappointed. This is a serious account by Clinton, about his strengths, weaknesses, and most importantly, his capacity to forgive his enemies. His early childhood experiences, especially what he learnt from his grandfather, seem to have made a major positive impact in his life. This, and how non-racist his folks were even though they poor, southern folks from the 1920s era, armed him with that all-important Teflon coating needed in politics."
books,,1.0,E-book is a disappointment.,"After reading the reviews of the book, I expected much more.  The e-book really just whets your appetite with generalities (e.g., about the internet or globalization) summarized from the full-text version.  One could get far more from a typical on-line article in Fortune, Business Week, etc.  The e-book version is 9 pages of about 14 font text, double-spaced.  I guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book.  I would still like to read the full-text version but I would advise avoiding the e-book version"
books,3 of 4,1.0,Very boring,"This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book"
books,5 of 6,4.0,Great political history of America in depression and war,"There is much to like in David Kennedy's history of the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s.  His book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period.  His examination of the New Deal is both insightful and judicious, while his description of America in the Second World War is gripping and informative.  Throughout the book Kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events, discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the American people and their government."

In my opinion, the particularly valuable chapters include:"

The book starts with Holly waking up on the morning of her wedding day. However, her day takes a sharp downturn when her fianc is murdered during a bank robbery that turned violent. Holly leads the official investigation with the aid of her friend in the FBI. The investigation leads her to a town that is not shown on any maps. The inhabitants are white supremacists who recruit Holly's dad Ham into joining their organization. Ham pretends to join this group and is quickly given a key role within it. His infiltration of the group enables the law enforcment agencies involved to learn that Ham is selected to assassinate a VIP, but no one knows whom the intended victim is. Unless they can learn the identity of the target, someone will die."

books,5 of 9,1.0,"Boring, Over-Written, and Pointless!","This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read"
books,3 of 3,5.0,"Should be considered ""must reading""","In Doing Business By The Good Book: 52 Lessons On Success Straight From The Bible, Dave Steward (Founder and CEO of World Wide Technology, a privately held, billion-dollar company headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri), draws upon his many years of personal experience and professional expertise to show his fellow Christians how they can succeed in building their business enterprise upon the solid foundation of Scripture. With the assistance of author Robert L. Shook, Steward has organized his presentation into specific chapters deftly addressing such issues as the entrepreneurial spirit and integrity, the concepts of delegation and adaption, finding a niche, providing good leadership in the service of others, building long-term relationships, taking a stand, the necessity for consistency, teamwork, risk-taking, operating a customer-driven company, handling confrontation, accountability, the role of praise and recognition, letting go and allowing God to work His will, and so much more. Doing Business By The Good Book should be considered ""must reading"" by all dedicated Christians in positions of managerial responsibility whether it be a local enterprise or an international conglomerate."
books,1 of 2,4.0,A little too much for In Death series,"As always, J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts gives a solid performance in Origin in Death.  The only negative thoughts I have on the book are that many of the events are clearly over the top with multiple clones and underground explosions.  Usually the In Death books reflect the gritty reality of 2059.  Origin in Death was much more Star Trek than Star Wars (the early years).  Otherwise, a solid writing effort from Roberts"
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Incredible Color Palette, Rich Collection of Pictures, Best Art Work Guide EVER","To call this book a chronology would be a mistake because the art work of the Genius Alex Ross is not presented in chronological order, but rather starts with the most popular characters Superman, Batman, etc., and then moves on to other work such as Justice League of America, Kingdom Come, Alan Moore, etc."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Timeless Classic,"Like many groundbreaking works, this one must be seen as important when it was written for what it said then, and important now for what it has led to. Inspired, without doubt, by the monumental Drucker study of IBM, it took case analysis a step further. Its seminal ideas are found in many contemporary studies and schools or management thinking which have taken these principles yet further."
books,5 of 15,2.0,Slow Pace and No Plot (written by a master),"Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying ""yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past.""  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it ""in the name of literature"", then that's up to you."
books,1 of 2,5.0,I thought this was dazzlingly brilliant...,"Fukuyama outlines how the ""intermediate social organizations"" of society, under the Protestant ethic, permitted the development of modern capitalist structures; whereas in low-trust societies (where you cannot depend on the corresponding person to trust you, or you to trust him), only family oriented businesses could grow, and inevitably collapsed after the second or third generation.  He links the development of these intermediate organizations--guilds, PTAs, unions, volunteer activities--to the social fabric that engendered trust.  He comments that a country can ""spend"" this hard-to-develop social capital and eventually become a rigid, non-trusting, and economically backward state.  Furthermore, Fukuyama points out that the United States probably is doing just that, in nearly all intermediate social organizations, which are now surrounded by litigious critics--the educational system, Boy Scouts, union-management conflicts, the Catholic Church (which has never trusted its parishioners to have other than the standard orthodoxy, and now has suffered enormous scandal), and so forth.  The lack of trust in our country is seen as pointing to our economic future, whether for good or bad."

books,2 of 2,5.0,"Interesting reading for bellydancers, very well-written","I enjoyed this book very much. The author was very clear about her research and the conclusions she reached. It really helps explain the cultural setting of belly dance in Egypt better than any other book I've read, and it's fascinating reading as well due to the little details she tells us about dancers living in Egypt. A must-read book for those interested in Egyptian belly dance"

Its actually fascinating to think there are really people out there like that

books,19 of 22,5.0,Destined to be regarded as a classic,"The Paleo Diet by Loren Cordain, Ph.D. is a monumental work that brilliantly explains and popularizes what may well be one of the biggest breakthroughs in scientific understanding in human history: the evolutionary hypothesis of human nutrition and lifestyle. This hypothesis does what no other diet and exercise regime does: it builds a scientific model that can be used to make predictions that can be tested and it does so upon the very foundation of biology--evolution."
books,30 of 32,5.0,Paine's common sense,"Thomas Paine's clear and concise writings make him one of the greatest political authors of his time. Basic thoughts of freedom and democracy, that seem so common place nowadays, were brought about because of Paines  &quot;radical&quot; ideas. His books Common Sense and The Rights of Man  were written not just for the political philosopher but also for the common  man. Both the aforementioned books played a big part in the American and  French Revolutions"
books,,4.0,"Not a bad book, but not great either","This is my second and probably last Lehane book.  It's not bad.  I found it to be worth finishing, so that warrants a weak 4 star rating.  But, I read this book shortly after reading George Pelecanos' latest novel, The Night Gardener, and this one suffers pretty severely in comparison.  Lehane seems to me to lack confidence in his ability to deliver a realistic, believable and still interesting story.  He reaches too far to make his characters and scenes a little cooler, a little more powerful and ultimately a little less true to life.  That's what people want, I suppose, from action thriller books.  But, I'd rather read something I can really see as realistic for crime drama.  This book is not quite that"
books,6 of 7,5.0,Vital for Historical Understanding,"Written originally in 1903 both as a gift to African Americans and a gift from an African American, ""The Souls of Black Folk"" describes through one man's (W. E. B. Du Bois) eyes the consciousness of turn-of-the-century African Americans. Using his own life as a social and psychological model, Du Bois traces the inner life of post-Emancipation and post-Reconstruction African Americans. Whether one agrees with all, most, little, or none of Du Bois' conclusions, any serious student of African American history and self-understanding can't afford to bypass this work."
books,4 of 6,5.0,Michael Ruhlman does it again!,"First let me tell you, I was not the kind of person who read chef-lifestyle books.  I picked up Mr Ruhlman's 'The Making of a Chef' at my local library a few years ago and was enthralled by the  day to day lives of CIA students described therein.  I ended up reading all of Mr Ruhlman's books, and each one pleased me more than the last.  This author's writing reminds me of Tracy Kidder, another writer who is able through his writing to make the reader visualize people performing their activities in the environment he describes.  The Reach of a Chef is a continuation of his discussions on chefs and food, and is a pleasure to read.  Something I should stress: I am from South Asia, and Mr Ruhlman's writing makes me keen to sample many kinds of cuisine he describes in his books.  He brings the knowledge of good food not only to the people of the United States, but to the whole world.  PS: After reading Mr Ruhlman's book ""The Soul of a Chef"" I happened to read ""Kitchen Confidential"".  Food books, chef books - bring 'em on, baby!"

books,4 of 5,4.0,Provides new insights,"The Brame murder/suicide was big news in this area for a long time.  I didn't really expect to learn too much new from a book.  However, I did learn a lot.  The author has done extensive investigation into the circumstances of the marriage, separation and relationships of this couple.  The book was more balanced than I would have expected too.  In general, the story has been told with all the good on the side of Crystal and all the evil on the side of David.  This book told the other side too, in case the reader wants to make up his/her own mind.  The theory at the end about how the shootings occurred was interesting and made sense to me.  Well worth reading"

books,6 of 8,5.0,Life-changing,"I'm like many of the statistical women described in the book who found themselves living well while married and then found themselves divorced and broke with little to show for years of sacrifice and hard work. It was then I discovered how dependent I had become on someone else to provide for my financial future. I call it ""marital welfare"" -- and I do agree that we are a culture of dependent creatures -- and this fact usually smacks a woman right in the face through circumstances she least expects. Part of rising above all of this has been a dawning awareness of how important it is to take the financial responsibility for my future into my own hands. Kim Kiyosaki has put into words what has already been placed in my heart -- it was the ""you're on the right track"" message that I needed to hear to further my resolve -- not just in finances but in every area where self-sufficiency needs to evolve. The good news is that I am remarried to someone who supports my financial plans, goals and dreams and shares in the excitement. This book does not give a step-by-step how-to, but what it does do is bring about a birthing process that can literally change your life because it provokes you to change how you VIEW your life. For many people, that's all it takes, and in that regard, this book has accomplished wonders"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Actually 4 1/2 stars,"Don't get me wrong this was a really good book.  And I am so close to giving it 5 stars.  It was just a little too short for me.  The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core.  The only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game.  You will fly through this book, it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it, even after that mild short coming I mentioned.  Just my opnion, I could be wrong"
books,5 of 6,5.0,AI's hardest problem...,"Whenever I read a book in translation I often wonder if it's the translator I love or hate, or the author themselves.  Literature in translation is essentially a complete re-writing of the book itself.  Consider Lewis Carroll:  How does one go about translating seemingly endless word play and words that are often made up?  Now consider the fact that Alice in Wonderland had been translated into over 50 languages.  If you could read all 50 languages, some would approximate your understanding of ""Alice"", and some would appear tangenital, or worse, dishonest to the original."
books,,5.0,"lyrical, evocative and elegant","Carole Radziwill's memoir is an exquisite description of loving relationships, family expectations, and maintaining a marriage with constant threat of terminal illness. The book is written in a no-nonsense tone-as the tragic story of her husband's recurrent cancer unfolds, Carole never resorts to hyperbole. Interconnected themes are deftly strung together like pearls. Anthony Radziwill did not want others to know of his illness, and the weight of maintaining a pretense that all was well increased with each bad check-up. His deteriorating prognosis and certain death was never openly discussed, although his cousin, John Kennedy, tried to push Carole into doing so."

books,1 of 2,1.0,Unbiblical and bad writing make for one star,"This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck."

books,2 of 2,5.0,Deep Change or Slow Death?,"In this wonderful book, Quinn challenges us to confront our own hypocrisy and make a choice between deep change or slow death -- that is to say between commitment or disengagement. It's actually not an easy choice to make. Most of us have taken the easy path and chosen not to speak out when w've known what needed to be changed. Or, we've run from a difficult work situation, leaving the problems behind for someone else to clean up, not admitting our part in the failure or taking responsibility for changing ourselves."
books,3 of 3,4.0,Kiyosaki - Does it Again!,"Kiyosaki's third book in his Rich Dad, Poor Dad series delivers again.  This book is a logical progression of RDPD and CFQ building on his principals of building wealth for the first half of the book.  Afterwards, Kiyosaki unveals what the reader has been waiting for . . . just how the rich invest.  He disclaims the book plainly for the reader looking for the next hot stock tip or get rich quick scheme.  The book delivers on it's title from a principal information standpoint, which should suit readers that realize that wealth is built up over time and based upon timeless principals and a strong foundation.  The last two phases of the book are extremely well-written.  Kiyosaki covers financial ratios, IPO offerings, taking companies public, and of course real estate principals.  He presents his information to get you thinking not to give you answers for he knows the answers will come if the action is initiated.  Another aspect of Kiyosaki that I particularly like is that he discusses his failures, which should let the masses know that riches are often found after many failures (more often it is the norm).  So if you want easy answers - don't buy this book.  If you want principals, ingredients for success in building wealth, and systematic structure on what you should be thinking in acquiring and KEEPING your wealth - this is your book!"
books,5 of 8,5.0,The Last Masterpiece,"WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of ""high art."" The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms."

Humans have been innovative for over 30,000 years, before the day of the first fire pit.  People have always utilized innovation.  But now it's is more vocally emphasized in the business realm because of ultra-competitive global market forces, and because we've reached the stage where technology enables change at a more rapid pace.  ""Innovation"" is a Mantra.  For lack of better words, creativity, adaptability, and innovation have always been vital. They've always been used by the successful: the winners; the victors. Innovation has always been mandatory. Survival: both literally and figuratively."

Luckily, I was very mistaken."
books,0 of 1,4.0,Strong debut,"Vladmir Girshkin is an unlikeable schemer who spends most of the story fleeing those whom he has defrauded or angered.  He deals with a series of bizarre girlfriends and an even less likeable mother.  Eventually moving from New York to the fictional ex-Soviet satellite republic of Stolavia, Vladmir ascends to a non-violent but powerful role within Russian organized crime.  The detailed side characters range from charmingly offbeat to intensely annoying.  Shteyngart hilariously mocks the vapid trendiness and vain sophistry of overeducated, underworked American postgraduates in Europe.  He also explores issues of national and personal identity as Vladmir moves back and forth from America to Europe.  I'm definitely interested in reading more from this author."
books,25 of 29,5.0,A Tale of How the Losers Eventually Won,"I have always been curious about the influence of Communism in Hollywood.  This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it.  It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated.  It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation.  I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful.  The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions.    Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union.  It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union.  Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors.    Finally, the Radoshes put the ""Hollywood Ten"" and the blacklist years in perspective.  They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated.   I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost.  It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed.  Who said you can't win for losing!"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Delicate brush strokes bring beauty to this restored work of art!,"It isn't embarrassing for me to admit that this wasn't my first Gabriel Allon read by Silva. Probably like a lot of others, I started somewhere in the middle. So, when I read ""The Confessor"", I had to fill in a few blanks for myself. I left some of my questions unanswered until I got to find out where it all began, and here it is... THE KILL ARTIST! I wondered if Silva would have really made it interesting for those who thought they knew about Gabriel Allon and Ari Shamron. I had some stuff to learn, and what I never knew was some life restored for me!"

Isabelle Forrester is stuck in a miserable marriage with a wealthy and obnoxious French man who treats her really bad. Bill Robinson is stuck in a life-less marriage to a wife who does not care about him. The two come together and over time fall madly in love. One night in England, together in a limousine, they give each other a breath-taking and long-lasting kiss. The kiss turns out to be a life-changing event for both of them..."
books,,5.0,For the Serious Home Chef,"This work is more of a 'textbook' than a simple 'cookbook.'  It should be approached methodically, and with a goal of mastering the details of processes, rather than just creating something tasty for dinner---while that is still certainly the outcome.  It is a masterpiece as a culinary educational tool."
books,8 of 15,1.0,"The Golden Rule works, This Book Falls Short","The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good.  John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday.  It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us.  However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book.  First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything.  I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love.  Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well.  Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track.  This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products.  Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed.  In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored.  Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better"

books,1 of 1,4.0,Historical experience as well as good story,"I had read somewhere that ""The Woman In White""  was the original mystery novel and was the classic to measure all later ones by.  After a slow start I became very engaged with the subtle clues and flowery vocabulary.  The book is a chance to experience a Victorian past that adds a special touch to an interesting story."

books,7 of 7,5.0,Don't let the small size fake you out!,This little book is GREAT!  It was one of many books that I bought when I took my first my first round with an SLR.  I really got more out of it than several of the more impressive (&amp; expensive) books that I bought!  I carried it around in my camera bag forever and referred to it many times.  Then when my daughter showed an interest in photography it is the one I picked to get her started.  If you are just starting out.. don't sweat the 5 bucks

Not for the casual dog owner, but then that's not the target market.  A wealth of material, well presented and organised, and without bias.  Now when's the one on behaviour modification coming out??!!"
books,1 of 3,4.0,When God Winks on Love,"I really enjoyed this book by SQuire Rushnell, almost as much as the first one of his that I read. Both books, which we have come to call the ""God Winks"" books, are great and a necessary item for everyone's home library"

books,7 of 8,4.0,A Hard Position From Which to Speak.  Graciously done.,"Don Stoner is pretty much damned if he does and damned if he doesn't, advocate an Old Earth Creationist position. On the one hand, he faces empirical data that demonstrates clearly the age of the universe. He actually focuses on the scientific evidence and shows quite clearly using the data obtained from quasars and pulsars and the resultant red-shifting demonstrated in the light spectrums that unless one accepts the implausable possibility that the speed of light has not always been constant, the universe is Billions of years old. He then makes a compelling argument that if Scripture is to be taken as true it cannot be at odds with the truth of the creation itself."
books,4 of 36,1.0,Wolf in Sheep Skin,"If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must ""... forgive God"" and that we must love God ""... even if He isnt perfect"". Kusher even has the will to say that ""...God would not be God..."" without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said ""...let US make man in OUR image"" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution."
books,3 of 5,2.0,"Another biography, but a different style.","As a longtime fan of Churchill, and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment, the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading. Well it was but only from the 'fan' position. The author sets out with good  intentions and early in the book he relates Churchill ways back into the  context of today's executive's environment. But, by the middle, and then  thereafter, he's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no  real relevance to application to today's leadership 'student'. At times Mr  Hayward really is squeezing the pips to show Winston as a model to follow -  I've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary hasn't  picked up on the idea. If you want to understand Churchill it's a good  read. If it's leadership you want you'll have to browse further"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Leave Room In Your Life For The Absurd,"Most of the reviews that I have written for Amazon are based on the books, the DVDs, and the CDs that I already own. I occasionally buy a new product via Amazon, but I mostly review the stuff that I already own."

books,,5.0,Gripping!,"This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. I ADORE this book.  The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating.  Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).  Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot.  It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are"
books,2 of 4,4.0,More of the same!,"The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted. This is one of those times when I wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend"
books,1 of 5,1.0,Worse thing he ever wrote!!,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Bukowski fan. Post Office is a great novel and Women is pretty damn good also, but this is just awful. If this was his first ever novel, it would never have been published. Bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then I can believe why. Pulp, is just a very bad book. The story is stupid, the plot is a mess, the characters are dumb. The only good thing about it is it's short. It's a shame to read something so bad from someone I used to love to read. Stay well away from this book, you will only be very disappointed"

books,4 of 8,5.0,Enjoyed This Book!,"When I was pregnant my first time, I carried this around everywhere!  I was hungry for knowledge and this seemed to be the only book that I could refer to more frequently than just the month-to-month!  I had wished that there was a day-to-day book, but this came very close to providing me with new information as frequently as possible.  It is a staple of the pregnancy book diet!"

books,3 of 3,5.0,Playing at Murder,"""Ripley's Game"" by Patricia Highsmith, opens with the following sentence: ""There's no such thing as a perfect murder...That's just a parlour game, trying to dream one up.""  An apt statement from Highsmith's unlikely hero Tom Ripley, but one that also sums up the novel as it begins.  The third novel in her Tom Ripley series finds Tom playing a nasty prank on an unassuming man, in which he soon finds himself involved in a grisly game of life and death."

Now look at Chapter 8.  ""Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks.""  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all"
books,8 of 9,5.0,The Mysterious Death of the Roman Empire,"Notice the title of Peter Heather's fascinating study of the final centuries of the Roman Empire.  It is a clear tribute to Gibbons, yet the ""Decline"" is intentionally missing.  Because according to Dr. Heather the Roman Empire never declined; its fall was due to external, rather then internal, forces, and the perpetrators were two:  the Huns and the Goths."

books,4 of 4,5.0,"Fascinating book on the ""Tail-end"" of the European Air war.","I often read about others that say they ""can't put the book down because it is soooooooooooooo captivating"". Well, ""Tail-end Charlies"" did that to me. What a super read. A dose of history and a dose of personal perspectives all in one. It is also an objective perspective relating to ""Butch"" Harris. Don't pass this one up."

books,2 of 2,4.0,"Simple, well done and thoughtful",This book is an easy and enjoyable read about a difficult philosophical topic.  It deals with the practical reality of the exisence of evil and ties it to a combination of random chance and people's free will.  That is the underlying thesis and deep philosophical arguments are avoided.
books,,5.0,Always Brilliant!,"Gary Larson never ceases to amaze me. I've been a religious follower of The Far Side for as long as I can remember. I love the way he looks at the lighter side of life, yet some of the comics really hit home. My favourite still is the deer with the target as a birth mark! Go Larry - you're my super hero"
books,12 of 12,5.0,When fighting and yelling don't work try this!,"This book was recommended by my son's therapist for us to read as a new way to parent.  I found the book quite interesting and it gave me some new thoughts.  We have incorporated some of the suggestions in the book and have had a lot of success with it.  I'm not sure if I could do all the responses to certain situations, but many chapters in which there were responses that we could use.  It does take an open minded parent, and those parents who are drill sgt. parents will have a tough time using this book unless they are willing to change."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"On ""Suttree""","In ""Suttree"", Cormac McCarthy doesn't so much shake the rafters of the illusory of literature as he does bore holes in its foundation. When his novel was published in 1979, you probably would have to have been a McCarthy reader to know about it - undoubtedly, there were erudite McCarthy readers making some noise over his three, previous works, but they were likely fairly small in number. As to his work, the old adage comes to mind: nothing worth having comes easily, and if you are to consider the dark themes and brittle, agrarian subject matter of his pre-Suttree work, you might be able to explain his relative obscurity. But, oh, how McCarthy takes these themes into Knoxville, Tennessee and with stunning craftsmanship, conjures up a visionary, humdinger of a novel. We have before us an astonishingly compelling and deeply personal opus that only a master storyteller could construct."
books,,4.0,"good, like facing the giants","Here goes my laymen's attempt at paraphrasing Matthew 22 vs 34 thru 3_...  Love God with all that you have in you, is the most important commandment... says Jesus, yet right along side (as on the other side of the same coin, or as two wings on a plane) is Love your neighbor as much as you love yourself...   and all of what the prophets say and all of the other commandments are built upon these 2 things that Jesus said. Labeled the Greatest Commandment...that indicates the importance of it."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Wonderful converstion starter,"I enjoyed the pictures in this book.  They show dogs of all ages in various positions.  The orientation on some pages is upright, on others, it's sideways, so you turn the book to look at the picture straight on.  It's a wonderful book to use to break the ice, or just to keep the conversation going.  The use of black-and white photos was genius - I found myself relating to the dogs as personalities.  Color photos tend to make me think of the background more than the dogs."

This puppy was my first large dog, and Kathy Santo's book gave me the confidence I needed to train her properly from day one.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a no-nonsense approach to establishing a lasting relationship with their dog"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Terrific Book,"Robert Caro is just flat out a great writer.  I marvelled at half page paragraphs in which he would paint the most intricate and vivid picture about some minor point.  Such economy and elegance.  I loved it.  Overall, his work on LBJ is just awesome."
books,12 of 12,5.0,What a hottie!,"This is one of the best biographies I have ever read. You can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work - it's a true labor of love.

So, I signed up for what I thought to be the best plan on the market, Weight Watchers.  They have that new ""whole foods"" plan.

books,4 of 4,5.0,One of my favorite books,"I know very little about psychology, but I found this book to be both informative and touching. I first heard about it when a cook at my summer camp read us ""The Last Hippie"" during an evening program. I was fascinated by the story. Finally, when I picked up a copy of the book for myself, I read through the whole thing in a day. I actually cried during one of the stories. Oliver Sacks teaches you a lot about how the human brain works without getting too clinical, and lets the humanity of the people he profiles shine through. This is a really good book"

I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.  He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.  The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.  It did have one thought that I really liked:  &quot;Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.

books,6 of 7,4.0,Good set of essays; not Wolfe's best,"Tom Wolfe pursues the idea that many Americans and Brits since World War II have been checking out of mainstream status competition in favor of pursuing status within distinct subcultures. This plays out in some interesting ways--most notably Wolfe watches Natalie Wood pursue status in a more traditional way by acquiring knowledge of art and even some Old Masters, while others play their own status game around photographing celebrities, in this case Wood herself. Essays on Hugh Hefner, California surf culture, and London mods are also worthwhile, as is a comic piece on Wolfe's misadventures with an &quot;automated hotel&quot;. Wolfe does bog down at times, however, in the minute stylistic details of the groups he covers; if you are not that interested in style in and of itself, your eyes may glaze over those passages. Still, this is a good read for anyone interested in subcultures (especially of the 1960s) and status-seeking"

books,5 of 5,4.0,The Start of an Outlander Spin Off??,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I began to read this book.  I had not really warmed to Lord John in the Outlander series, but I like Gabaldon's writing style, so thought this might be an interesting read.  For a ""short story"" by Gabaldon (less than 400 pages), this was pleasantly entertaining."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Hilarious send-up of the art world,"This is a smart, funny exploration of one of the lesser-known elements of the high-stakes art world -- the right of an artist's estate to declare a work ""authentic"" or not.  The questions of authenticity that drive the plot are also reflected in the book's narrative structure, in which the story is told through two competing voices -- one a defeated, cynical, world-weary artist and the other his slow-witted, demanding and cantakerous brother  Neither is a particularly reliable narrator, but the truth that emerges from their combined account is surprisingly sweet."
books,,4.0,Live Sedaris!,"David Sedaris is the only man I LOVE to listen to ...that voice...the perfect pacing...the droll humor...His stories are a compelling listen with a large drop of ""I need to see this man on a book tour"" thrown in.  The Carnegie Hall reading is another classic that even someone not familiar with him can fully enjoy. The audience is not as distracting as you would think and he plays to them well without a lot of big pauses for all the applause. I've given this as a gift with not a complaint!  A Good Listen"

It is a stable of any scholar's libraries. Wing has an easy to understand translation that smoothly connects the ideas of the Toa with modern physics principles and leadership strategies. The work also offers the reader a wide range of historical information about the rulers and has side by side to the text the explanations of the key Chinese calligraphy. However, what separates this work from others is the insightful commentaries of the author that reveal the underlining premise of this powerful work. Whether this is your first reading of the Tao De Ching, or you're a student of the Tao you will be impressed with this work"
books,,5.0,Grate sequel.,"You would think, after the outstanding success of Artemis Fowl, Eoin Colfer would find it hard to live up to. Not at all. Eoin Colfer seems to have a knack for turning out books that are impossible to put down, and which are capable of delighting readers of all ages. And the Arctic Incident is no exception."
books,210 of 214,5.0,The Best Pregnancy Book of the 5 we used.,"The greatest strength of this book is the week-by-week format. It outlines specific changes that are pretty close to exactly as predicted. We noticed many of the things and then read them that week, ie. phlegmyness, inability to travel more than an hour and dryness at night just to name a few.  This book is very well balanced and it tends to focuses more on the positives of pregnancy and not the possible complications. This is the 5th Edition of this book with millions of copies sold. Overall it is a great help. I definitely recommend it to all expectant couples. These authors also wrote a number of supporting or complimentary books:"
books,2 of 3,4.0,This series gets better and better with each book!,"This is the first book featuring Gabriel Allon, an Israeli agent who poses as an art restorer. The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars is that the next book in the series, The English Assassin, is even better"
books,7 of 8,4.0,4.5 stars: A highly visual aid in dealing with type,"I was inspired by some of the samples of type usage in the book from the first few pages. Ellen Lupton, the author of ""Design Culture Now"", came up with a book to fill a void where it was much needed. It is hard not to encounter useful elements in it to both, help you enhance existing designs or tackle new territory."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Beautifully written little book,"The title of my review basically tells exactly how I feel about this work. The writing (and the translation) is simply beautiful, and it's of such a length that it will take about 2 hours of your time to read. These 2 hours will not be wasted, I assure you, for you will read words written by a modern master of literature. The plot is quite simple, and often not even necessary, for the language and the writing carries this book from beginning to end. I only wish that the book were longer so that I could spend more time with a very delightful elderly man"
books,,5.0,Great Story!!!!,I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them
books,,4.0,A great book,I love this story. Echo lodge was great. It was about the last book where Anne is in Avonlea and a little girl. Very excellent book
books,6 of 8,5.0,Great Memoir,Extraordinary memoir by a gifted writer with an extremely unusual story to tell
books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Book!,"I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Endorsed by the powers and professionalism of the American Kennel Club,"More than a million copies of this reference classic's prior editions have been sold, so if this updated 20th edition THE COMPLETE DOG HANDBOOK holds a familiar ring, that's why. But the 20th edition offers even more: not only is it endorsed by the powers and professionalism of the American Kennel Club, but it packs in all 153 breeds recognized by the Club, along with standards, breed histories, and photos - including the twelve most recently recognized breeds. Lest you think this is just for pros, look at the sections advising on how to choose and train a dog, responsible breeding, canine first-aid and more. Add sections on AKC sports and a glossary of terms and you have a real winner."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Carolina Moon - A Very Good Story,"Young 8-year old Hope Lavelle is out on a nighttime adventure to meet her very best friend, 8-year old, Tory Bodeen, a victum of neglect and abuse by both her mother and father.  Hope has every comfort of life and is the daughter of a successful southern family with a twin sister, Faith and an older brother, Cade (Kincade).  Sneaking out to meet Tory, Hope is murdered.  The story moves ahead 18 years and picks up w/Tory as an adult dealing with the ghosts of her past and present.  ""Carolina Moon"" is a very well-written story and will keep you fascinated until the very conclusion.  Supporting players such as Iris, Cecil (Tory's grandma and significant other) as well as Wade (her cousin), add amazing color to the plot.  Personalities are described so well you can almost see these people and feel for each in their dealings with life's turmoil as well as joy.   I would definitely recommend this book to all, especially Nora lovers!  It has murder, mystery, romance, and comedy.  What more could you ask for in a book"
books,19 of 90,1.0,Eye candy and weak on history,"I didn't read the entire book, simply browsed it for about 20 min while my daughter shopped for books in the kids section of the bookstore.  However, it doesn't take much more than 20 min to get through it.  The book is nothing but a timeline of  miscellaneous events and grouped by presidency.  Each event is covered by no more than a couple of sentences. You might learn some trivia going through it but not much else.  It is also not a very objective view of US history - not a single ""factoid"" given for the 8 years of the Clinton presidency was positive, only negatives"
books,1 of 2,5.0,I love this damn book...,There is nothing wrong with this book. It's not too long. It's not hard to read. It's perfect. I read this book in elementary school and I haven't read a book sense that I think is better. This is my all time favorite
books,5 of 5,4.0,Forget the movie,"Many will remember the movie made of this.  My advice?  Don't.  I was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film, but, finally decided to give it a go (despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover...) This book is an example of what a meticulous, fearless and talented writer of prose can come up with in response to the world around him. While being a great 'page-turner' as far as plot goes, Wolfe manages, through a complex web of ironies and double ironies, to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place. Hands down one of the most enteratining novels that I have ever read, and definitely the best rendering of modern New York City in fiction! This paperback was so ubiquitous I waited 10 years to reluctantly read it, and only because it was one of the only books on the shelf where I was staying. Boy, was I rewarded with this compulsively readable, suspenseful, razor-sharp story. For social satire to be so fiendishly plotted is a real treat and this story will have you racing to its inexorable conclusion"
books,3 of 3,2.0,Bruner Flashes Ingenuity In A Overly Dense Form,"I read Bruner's book in one of my doctoral seminars which added a unique perspective on curriculums in early childhood education; however, journeying into the book and determining the main points of argument will challenge due to Bruner's overly dense prose."
books,,5.0,Hilarious,"The Far Side is my favorite comic, out of all. It is positively loaded with randomness that will catch you off guard. Larson's comics are the kind that makes you think about what is going on, comparing the picture to the caption, and it is hysterical. There are scizophrenic kangaroos, plane driving sheep, duck relays, and pretty much any other twisted idea out there."
books,,5.0,The epitomy of a grief manual,"Harper Neeld's book is an incredibly detailed compilation of the author's personal experiences in the sudden loss of her young husband, interviews with other widows/widowers, and discussions of phases of the grieving process.  I would rate this book highly, along with one of my favorite grief authors, thanatologist Alan Wolfelt (e.g. Understanding Your Grief books).  Harper Neeld seamlessly combines her painful, personal story with factual, helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks I have read on widowhood.  I used the introspective questions with my grief therapist, who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught."
books,1 of 1,5.0,FANTASTIC!!,Wish I had bought this book first!  Bobbi Brinker tells it like it really is and doesn't sugar coat anything.  This book was most instrumental in helping me decide to have an African Grey Congo in my life
books,28 of 28,5.0,A fabulous collection of short short stories for teachers,"&quot;Impact&quot; is a book my school has used for nearly a decade as an introduction to the short story, literary issues, and writing projects.  An excellent selection of 50 short-short stories, &quot;Impact&quot; follows  up each story with a discussion of some appropriate literary term, a  selection of questions that are actually worth answering (as a teacher, I  know how bad these usually are), and some really innovative writing topics.   The stories are all first-rate, from Shirley Jackson's &quot;Charles&quot;  to Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man at the Bridge&quot; to Arthur C. Clarke's  &quot;Who's There?&quot;  Most of the stories also hinge on some ironic  twist, allowing that most difficult and valuable of literary concepts to be  taught thoroughly.  Although a bit pricey for purchase just to read,  &quot;Impact&quot; is also an excellent collection for anybody aspiring to  write short stories.  They simply don't get much better than these"
books,3 of 4,4.0,"A light, satisfying read","I have to admit, I liked the original ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" more, but this was still a fascinating book at what motivates people to commit murder. We have a dying man, who slighted Tom Ripley, and is now fingered by Ripley and a friend to go kill some Mafia figures. Money that might not be tempting in ordinary circumstances becomes reason enough at the prospect of dying and leaving his family destitute. What I liked was that Jonathan didn't jump up to do the murder, nor have a sudden change of heart. He was sort of swept up in the whole thing. And what is interesting is that Tom comes as close to forgiving as a psychopath is capable--he did come to Jonathan's rescue more than once. A complex game, indeed, with an ending that will keep you guessing right to the end. It does leave me wondering, though, how does Tom keep getting away with murder"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Bought for a recent widow,"I bought this book in audio for a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer after 44 years of marriage.  The day it arrived, she listened to both tapes and said she could so identify with the author. She thanked me profusely for this gift and said she was going to listen to it in her car as she drove. Her husband has only been dead a month as of this writing, and neither of us expects her to ""heal"" in record time, but she found comfort in this book and made me so glad this is the one I chose to send her.  Based on her comments, I strongly recommend it to the grieving, especially widows"
books,,4.0,Too close for comfort - this one'll make you think....,"I am one of those DeMille fans that marks the launch date of his novels on my calendar, and plans all activities around being at my nearest Costco to pick up one of the first copies.  This book was well worth waiting for - with subject matter that, in this present time, was more than timely, and, not that far outside the realm of possibility.  It's scary to think that people like Bain Madox, the villain, exist, but they do, and anybody who thinks Wild Fire was some sort of wild fantasy, needs to think back to some of the crazies we've experienced so far in this life. Think about Hitler, Saddam, and that crazy little guy in North Korea.  Do we really think that America could not produce such a nut?"

books,0 of 4,5.0,Listen to this book BEFORE reading mumbo jumbo,"I wish more people could see that their humanity in the world rather than try to be God, or relentlessly seek answers when none exist. This is a brilliant discourse on the sadder parts of the human experience. Rather than try to alleviate pain by trying to find out why a tragedy happened, etc ... it is often more healing to also see the humanity of an event when no real explanation is possible. Bad things happen to good people and vice-versa. This world is complex and simple at the same time. But most of all, this book is a blessing against the current wave of New Age blame game mumbo jumbo..."
books,8 of 9,5.0,Must all literature be a mad rush to a formulaic conclusion,"Many readers of 'Waiting for Godot' obsess about the identity of Godot and whether he represents God or any other almighty being. It is unlikely that Beckett was referring to God as the man for whom the characters are waiting, as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in Beckett's theatre."
books,0 of 1,5.0,A difficult book to put down,"Wow!  I have read a few Grisham books, and I have to say that this is the best one I have read thus far.  He drags you in very quickly with Mitch, the main protagonist in the story.  He tells about this background and the sudden riches he has.  He seems to have it all:  a great job, a beautiful wife, a nice home, a great car, and living in a wonderful city.  Only one problem.  He finds out later how unsavory his employer is."
books,1 of 1,5.0,The Greed of an Era,"This book covers in depth the LBO of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era"

books,4 of 10,5.0,fantastic!,"This book is by far one of the best cookbooks I have. While many of the better recipes in the book require a good deal of planning, the reward is well worth the effort!"
books,,4.0,Delightful fable,"This is a great little book -- a fairy tale with a twist.  There is an intelligent sweetness to it.  I think it fell down a little toward the end --   I would have liked it better if the darker plots hinted at in the beginning were not so quickly disposed of about two-thirds of the way through.  Not that I would wish darker consequences on the hero and heroine, but a little more complex working out of at least one of those sub-plots would have improved the book.  Still well worth reading.  Charming."
books,8 of 8,5.0,Great book for providing comfort & education to young veg's,"This book is written in a very fun, age-appropriate style.  It highlights many of the concerns and interests of the young vegetarian.  It includes jokes, recipes, information, comebacks, and even famous vegetarians.  A great read for the young vegetarian, especially one you may be afraid of losing to peer pressure.  NOTE:  Although veganism is mentioned, the book focuses on vegetarianism, not veganism"
books,,2.0,What a disappointment!,I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.
books,6 of 21,2.0,Depressing,"I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you."
books,7 of 8,4.0,"Finally, some good basic principles for home decorating!","OK, so this book is a bit old now and I found it late.  But- the advice is timeless and very useful.  Unlike so many decorating books that are just filled with pictures of beautiful rooms in beautiful homes, this book gives you some basic principles so you can make your own stuff beautiful in your own home.  Some of the decorating that I had already done in my home I really like, and this book tells me the principle behind what I did - why I like it.  Some of the decorating I have done in my own home I don't like, and this book tells me what I can do to fix it."

Fortunately, at some point I woke up to that fact and decided to educate myself.  I took classes, read books and did everything I could to become a skilled interviewer.  Without question, one of the most helpful tools to escaping Bozoland was this book.  Although I am now a freelance business consultant and have no employees of my own, I frequently assist my clients with their own hiring processes, and in so doing I still refer extensively to Martin Yate's excellent book"
books,8 of 8,5.0,If you are looking for a book for great vegan basics- buy this book!,"I love this book! Everything I have made tastes good and I love that it doesn't use ""weird"" ingredients found in other vegan cookbooks. It's great for someone who is new to vegan cooking or someone who is cooking for non-vegan family of friends. You can feel confident that the recipes in this book will turn out well and will not scare your friends and family. This is one of my very favorite vegan cookbooks."
books,2 of 3,5.0,Common Sense to the Forefront!,"The basic premise after all the wash is done, is that those who are what the authors refer to as 'Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)' have figured out the difference between what they want and what they need; that they aren't sucked into the consumerism machine that the marketing hypnotists attempt to impose upon us; and that they understand that there's more than one way to get the things that they need, which often involves innovation, barter, and yes.... a little effort."
books,2 of 2,5.0,What a great book!,I couldn't put the book down when I first bought it.  Here it is months later and I've read it again.  The story is great!  I do wish that Nora Roberts would have continued the story maybe into a trilogy.  I would like to know more about what happens to Sophia and Ty.  Also Pillar and David-----  I highly recommend this book.  Its definitely one of her BEST

A soothing, rhythmic book that talks about pussycats, kangeroos, wild things in the forest, sailboats and engines all  getting quiet and sleepy.  My grandson saves it as the last book to read  and he falls asleep by the time we finish the little prayer at the end.  A  very special book indeed"

books,7 of 8,5.0,Renewal of Indian wars,"Margaret Coel has created an excellent series in which she brings alive the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and describes the Arapahoe customs in wonderful detail.  In this installment, Father O'Malley receives a mysterious phone call which implies that an old grudge between the Arapahoe and Shoshone Indians has been re-ignited, and that dead Indians can be found on an ancient battle ground.  When Father O'Malley goes to investigate, he discovers three dead Shoshones whose bodies have been posed to resemble positions reminiscent of old battles. Things heat up when the young Shoshone men vow to gain revenge for the murder of their friends.  Vicky Holden, the other main character in the series, has entered into a law partnership with Adam Lone Eagle, and they disagree as to the kinds of cases they should be handling.  Vicky wants to defend Frankie Montana, who is a suspect in the murders, and Adam tries to persuade her not to take Frankie as a client.  As always, author Coel creates a wonderful setting and characters, and in this book she writes another strong entry in the series."

This is not a book you can read on your flight to LV and hope to gain an advantage. This is about a system that was years in the making. I""m facinated by how successfully this system worked - to the tune of millions in winnings."
books,4 of 5,4.0,Good Treatment of a Valuable Concept,"While this book has been around for a while, it is a good treament of a valuable concept.  How we interact with our colleagues depends in many respects on how we and they see the world.  Deep Change gives a simple, yet effective framework for that understanding and builds from there.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency uses this book in one of their leadership courses, and I imagine numerous private organizations also use it"
books,1 of 5,1.0,A mishmash of unrelated ideas. A waste of time.,"I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands"
books,1 of 1,2.0,Thin characterization,"I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters."
books,8 of 11,5.0,A Tale Of Two Women,"""The Transit of Venus"" is an extraordinary piece of modern literature.  Hazzard has a special talent for combining words on a page.  This talent is truly and uniquely illustrated here.  Her similes and metaphors, her adjectives and adverbs, her incisive psychological look at the characters inner thought processes and pattern are all here beautifully put together."
books,53 of 54,5.0,Ian Myles Slater on: A Fine New Harvest Reaches the Marches,"""Lud-in-the-Mist"" was first published, to both some incomprehension and some critical success, in the 1920s. It opens with, as an epigraph, a reflection by the author's friend and sometime-collaborator, the classicist Jane Ellen Harrison, on the otherwise inexpressible longings revealed in myth. The setting is the land of Dorimare, which is certainly not England, but is something like it; just as the seaport of Lud-in-the-Mist is not exactly London in the Fog. For one thing, England never had such remarkably *interesting* neighbors as does Dorimare -- at least not across any merely geographical border. Not that the solid, and increasingly stolid, burghers of Lud have any intention of acknowledging Fairyland or its inhabitants. That nonsense was all done away with in a glorious (but not The Glorious) Revolution, by their brave, revered, but (now) embarrassingly enthusiastic, ancestors, who chased the last Duke, and the Priests, off to -- well somewhere over the border."
books,15 of 17,5.0,A Great Book!,No you won't learn from this book because it is a cookbook and like all cookbooks it gives you the recipe.  Even the advance user doesn't remember everything and this is wonderful to lookup what you do need.  You may be able to find the scripts other places but this saves time which to me is money by having them all in one place.  I have this book sitting with the JavaScript cookbook and they both get plenty of use!  They make my life easier and I think the book states what it is from the cover.  You won't learn &quot;how to &quot; from this book but I don't see anywhere on the book that says you would.  A wonderful assest
books,20 of 32,2.0,"Entertaining, but badly out-of-date","A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo"
books,3 of 3,4.0,Great for young adult students,"The book encourages students to explore their own strengths and weaknesses, and prompts them to recognize aspects of themselves in ways they probably hadn't thought before.  Most of us are quite curious about what our strengths might be, and with this book, the student's self-examination isn't a painful process.  Rather than offering a step by step list of Do's and Don'ts, the approach taken here is to help the student develop a highly individualized action plan to help them take control managing their coursework.  It's a relatively hefty book, at least compared to others I've seen in this genre, but this doesn't detract."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Good times,"For starters this book is a good read, I rarely read and I knocked it out in a day and a half. Once you start reading it you won't be able to put it down. You will talk about it with your friends and they will be clueless about what you are saying but you will not be able to stop. So eventually they will want to read it and think you are the coolest guy ever for passing this book onto them. If you like to party, drink, sleep with girls, treat others with complete disrespect, and basically live life to its fullest you will kill for this book. Have a good day and next time I see you, you better be Tucker Max drunk (yeah read it and find out what that is punk!"

books,0 of 4,2.0,Silverthorne,"I hated this book. There was no point to it cept to waste pages and time reading it. This took me the longest to read and actully like.  I never got instrested in the book and there no premise to it that made me wanna read more of it.  Its about Arutha the new prince of Korndor having to save his princess.  To me thats all you need to know.  I would really not say to read this book, but skip to A Darkness at Sethanon."
books,,5.0,What Is It to be a Color?,"No surprise that Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize.  My Name is Red is an amazing tale, told by multiple characters (and inanimate illustrations as well), and deals with love, loss, envy, hatred, and the intracacies of art and its creators.  Breathtaking prose is alive on every page due to the author's magnificent imagination.  I intend to read more of Pamuk's work, and hope it has the same effect"
books,5 of 5,5.0,One of Them and One of Us,"Most books about breast cancer are either written from the point of view of a doctor or of a patient.  This wonderful book comes from the education and experience of a doctor and from the experience of a patient.  In knowing both sides, Dr. Kaelin is able to share information in a way that I have not seen in any book before.  I am very thankful that she has provided this valuable resource for those who are just beginning the journey of dealing with breast cancer and for those, like me, who have been on this road for quite awhile.  Even after 8 yrs of being cancer-free, I have found quite a bit of very useful information in Dr. Kaelin's book.  This is a must-have book for every patient diagnosed with breast cancer"
books,,4.0,Essential for New Vegetarians,...especially young ones. I have now been a vegetarian for five years and rarely use this book any more but it was GREAT when I was first starting out. Lauren Butts was sixteen when she published this book and the recipes are all geared towards kids in that age group - both in simplicity and taste.
books,2 of 2,5.0,Worth the read,This book provides another perspective on the mind of the CEO. Worth reading
books,2 of 4,5.0,Best School Book Read,"A Separate Peace has been read by many highschoolers, including myself. Over the years I have dread every book handed to me at school, they all just dragged on. Except for A Separate Peace, which has become my all time favorite school book. The bond between two boys, named Phineas and Gene, at a boarding school in New Hampshire during WWII captured me. I ended up finishing it in four days (which is fast for me)."
books,,5.0,Maximum Ride School is Out Forever,"I purchsed this book, as well as Maximum Ride Angel Experiment. I read them both before giving them to my children to read.

books,11 of 11,5.0,Loved It!,"I have several home organization and storage books, but this is the only one that I have actually read cover to cover.  At first, when I got it, it was smaller than I was imagining and it had no pictures, so I thought I wouldn't like it.  I was wrong!  It gives ideas that make you maintain an organized house without much effort, once the initial setup of the suggested organizing ideas and techniques is in place.  This book confirmed some of the things I was already doing that worked, it gave me new ideas and it helped me refine some that I already had in place.  A quick and easy read and definitely suggested"
books,2 of 6,5.0,"Murr on ""Gravity's Rainbow""","Perhaps extreme paranoia is one way out of, or at least our only healing response to our existential loneliness. (The other way, of course, is love, but this takes a second place in Pynchon's world view.) ""They have done this to me, I am Their victim"", is perhaps a more comforting world-view, than ""I am completely irrelevant."" At least one can have some kind of fun or meaning to life in finding out who They are and why They have done it."
books,16 of 24,5.0,A Must Have ...,"Marjorie Garber's ""Shakespeare After All"" is first-rate scholarship on Shakespeare's plays.  It is a 'must have' for anyone interested in Shakespeare's works - whether the person has a casual interest or a scholarly background.  The information is conveyed in an accessible style.  I have purchased a number of copies and given this work as gifts to friends.  One should pick it up and read it"

books,1 of 1,4.0,very detailed,"This is not just a cookbook!  It is excellent for a teen,or anyone staring out as a vegetarian in a nonvegetarian society.  It gives great advice on foods, their prices and easy preparation tips. There is also great incite included throughout from experienced vegetarian teens. Almost all of the recipes can be done very quickly and the ingredients are flavorful and common."

books,,4.0,Enjoyed the book - a definite page turner.,I greatly enjoyed this book -- it is not the best one written by James Patterson but it was very good.  I would recommend it
books,4 of 7,5.0,Worth rehashing the second day.,"Nora crafted one of my all-time favorite books.  Why I picked up a paperback copy as a freshmen in high school is beyond me.  Why I finally got around to reading it at 18 is also a mystery.  Why I've reread it more times that my dogged copy can tell is no mystery meat; sadness steeped in life's tea.  In real life, I've played the part of the toddler in this tale.  Wish I could say my folks were class acts, such as the author and her former spouse, but chicken fried steak is more common in middle America than Lillian Hellman's Pot Roast. --Laurel82"
books,,4.0,Outstanding,"The others are right: it would help to read the first two novels in order to appreciate the character of Tom Ripley. This is important for this installment because this is the novel where Ripley almost has a soul -- he actually undertakes his usual nefarious activity in order to atone for his own malignant action (first a rumor, then a murder plot). The characters don't exactly deepen Highsmith's narrative, but she overcomes the problem of writing a creative mystery by bringing more and more characters into the mix -- the mysterious Reeves Minot, who appeared in Ripley Under Ground (an underrated novel, in my estimation), becomes a rather important character. And the unlucky pawn in Ripley's game, Trevanny, lends the story the closest thing to a moral center that one could hope for. Oh -- and the action scenes are relatively plentiful, and exhilirating"
books,7 of 7,5.0,I don't know how I got along without this!,"Thank God someone has finally put together a comprehensive guide of affordable things to do in LA!  As a parent I am always struggling to come up with entertaining (and inexpensive) activities to do with my kids.  This pocket guide is loaded with tons of FREE things to do in LA.  They even have info about parking, directions, stroller accessibility...  It's great!  This has become an essential item in my household."
books,1 of 1,5.0,A laugh a minute,"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. I bought this book to read on a flight from the UK to Australia and it had me laughing so loud I was quite an embarrassment! I'm not a 'chick lit' kind of girl but this was a real exception. As an author myself I really admire the talent it takes to write a book where almost every line makes you smile or laugh. Pure escapism, very charming and such good fun, and somehow it also manages to be a book which makes you take stock of what really counts in life. This should be compulsory reading for every workaholic - and certainly every lawyer. Enjoy"
books,27 of 37,4.0,How to become a more successful speaker,"As one could expect from a expert in human interaction, Dale Carnegie  wrote a clear and concise book on public speaking. The book is very  readable, with loads of &quot;practical&quot; examples, and with a  fantastic summary after each chapter. I am sure the book can be of help to  the novice as for the expert speaker alike. I gave the book 4 stars,  because in my view only mind blowing books like Carnegie's &quot;How to Win  Friends and Influence People&quot; deserve the maximum of 5 stars"
books,21 of 25,2.0,"Several important points, but de Soto oversells and is mind-numbingly repetitive","De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make ""extralegal"" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on."
books,12 of 12,5.0,Very clever smart chick lit!,"Wendy Wasserstein has won Pulitzer prizes and it shows in this book!  Of course it's ""just chick lit"" but still very well written, well thought out chick lit that's a cut above the rest in my opinion.  It's not as good as the Sex and the City series - on tv, that is - but heading in that direction!"
books,0 of 2,4.0,A interesting insight into the workings of the brain,"Interesting and insightful. However it can occasionally lack clarity, lose the thread of what is being said. Even so, this is well worth snapping up for a summer read. Especially so if you have not read this kind of stuff before"
books,2 of 5,5.0,A unique reference book,The historic quaintness of its grammar informs me and often makes me titter while reminding me of my birthright. No home should be without a copy no matter who the reader or their diction
books,3 of 3,5.0,A consummate storyteller.,Origin in Death
books,2 of 5,5.0,Exellent and well documented,"Inside Al Qaeda Global network of Terror was one of the most compelling books about Al Qaeda and the new threat of terrorism that I have ever read. The non-bias straightforward writing of Gunaratna brought to light the vastness of terrorism and its reach throughout the world. The book is very concise in the facts and the chapters are very fluid like. If you desire to learn about Al Qaeda and how complex it really is, I recommend this book. Over all an excellent read"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Judge Dee Short Stories,"Dutch diplomat Robert van Gulik wrote the Judge Dee mysteries (in English!) to introduce the West to the Chinese version of the mystery story, which arose centuries before the English detective story.  Judge Dee is an actual historical person, a magistrate of the seventh century during the T'ang dynasty, who was renown in China for his ability to solve crimes.  In Judge Dee at Work, van Gulik presents us with eight short stories each of a single case (the novels, in the Chinese tradition, involve 3 intertwined cases) that take place throughout the judge's long career (magistrates were usually moved to a new post every three years).  A table at the back of the book, places each case and all the novels within the timeline of Judge Dee's life."
books,4 of 4,4.0,"Truly ""complete""-useful to the novice & expert alike!","This is the sort of cookbook that grows with you.  If you're a novice cook, or you cook only because you have to put something on the table every night, you will find this book enlarges the number of fool-proof chicken dishes you can put on the table without much fuss.  Each chapter suggests several variations, so you can adapt to what you have on hand or what's fresh at the store.  There are also handy chapters on soup, leftovers and turkey breasts."
books,3 of 4,4.0,Learning to Accept the Insanity,"Waiting for Godot, a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes, attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with--it is a call to action. This play is packed with nonsensical dialogue. The plot does not exsist. Yet, once we realized that Waiting for Godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense--at least in subtle ways. Much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality, but, that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century. It's enigmatic, a puzzle of words, poetry, and philosophy. I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. The play is short and does not take too much commitment. Take a quiet evening and give it a shot. What are you waiting for"
books,7 of 7,5.0,Best !!!!,Greg Palast loves challenges.Bold and sarcastic. Now you can understand why emergent countries will always remain in the third world for the benefit of big corporations and corruptous politicians. Not surprising that all the info provided by Palast was never shown on the america's news.
books,4 of 6,4.0,Nothing so black... as the inferno of a human mind.,"One of the most compelling parts of the brilliant ""House of Leaves"" was Appendix II, Part E -- the ""Whalestoe Letters."""
books,44 of 54,5.0,Please don't review it if you don't understand it.,"Probably most people reading this already know of this book's reputation and influence, so I'll skip over both the chapter-by-chapter analysis and the praise (I'd end up in what Kirk would call ""overweening"" praise, anyway).  But I do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer.  The caricature to which I refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change.  In fact, the reviewer even argued that the Soviet Union could have been seen as a ""conservative"" system (an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media)."
books,,5.0,The Conservative's Bible,"Kirk's book is supposedly the bible of Conservatives. Not neo-conservatives, but Conservatives. He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth)."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Very very very funny!!,"After checking with customs in Norway, I found out that books doesn't add tax when bought abroad, and then I decided to buy this Complete set of Gary Larson's Far Side Gallery!

books,7 of 7,5.0,Souls of Black Folks,"The audio CD version of Dubois' &quot;Souls of Black Folks&quot; is horrible. The reader makes mistake after mistake. He mispronounces words, makes breaks where none were to be taken, and his reading in general is poor. He has made a vibrant and enjoyable read a boring and atrocious listening experience. I guess I'll have to find something else to listen to on those long drives. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT Purchase this rendering of &quot;Souls&quot;"
books,,2.0,No flash in this pan,"This book won't turn me off to JP, who I admire very much for his style of cooking and pleasant personality; but the book was a bit boring.  Once I gleaned the book, my usual ""How can I decide what to cook first?"" didn't hit me.  I picked up the book again with the same results -- just not enough inspiring stuff there.  I haven't looked at the book since; so I can't even say this or that recipe was lackluster.  I only remember my response to the book.  It wan't the 'fast food' concept either because everyone needs quick recipes in the cooking repertoire.  I cook a lot.  I'm not a cookbook collector; my cookbooks are stained and tattered.  I'm afraid ""Fast Food My Way"" will remain in pristine condition until I can give it to someone who will assign it more value than I can.  Each book I have on the shelf has to carry its weight or it's off to the pantry -- my culinary Siberia for cookbooks -- where this cookbook now resides.  For some reason I found JP cooking from this book on TV much more pleasurable than entertaining the idea of cooking from this cookbook."
books,,5.0,"Another Rave  Review, Not That One's Needed","With several hundred Amazon rave reviews, it seems overkill to add another, but what the heck:  ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is an outstanding piece of work by one of the best.  Connelly's ability to weave a compelling story in among the hills and bars (the drinking bars as well as the  ones before which you conduct trials) borders on magic.  The plot here is amazingly diabolical -- just when you think you know where it's going, Connelly pulls the rug away.  Haller is a wonderful character, delightfully shady and opportunistic but with a (somewhat tarnished) heart of gold. I hope Connelly keeps bringing him back.  But I hope he doesn't retire Bosch, either.  I think Connelly should turn out two books a year -- one of each guy.   I know it won't happen, but I can dream.  Thanks again, Mr. Connelly, for keeping me delightfully awake these past few nights."
books,20 of 20,4.0,Aye Yie Yie!,"I would give this book five stars if it weren't for the level of difficulty in reading it...just had to take off a star for that reason alone.  This isn't the book for the first time dog owner or casual trainer. It's a serious book for the well-versed student of dog behavior and training.  Mr. Lindsay definitely knows what he's talking about but the reader must already have a fairly good grasp of the ""concepts"" behind his explanations in order to fully understand the material.  It was a good read that I had trouble putting down, though!   If you're serious about learning the more advanced concepts and principles in dog behavior and training, the book is well laid out and informative to the max"

books,,4.0,Beyond the Strike Zone,"Most serious fans can roll off satistics about their favorite player but few realize that the numbers they cite have little to do with wins and losses. Baseball is a team sport that captures the American Spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend. Even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game. Likewise, a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the win/loss talley. In Moneyball, Michael Lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game. Like real life, this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the Sports Page. Every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics. There is the so-so pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game, or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track. Lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the LA Angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and hard-nosed business managers can profit from and enjoy."
books,2 of 4,2.0,Inconsistent,"I think I would have liked this book if I had read it when I was 14 or 15. Sweet, dreamy, simplistic. But I am much older and I was struck by the inconsistencies: The young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people; the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later - I lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest; the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel (in 1938??). Then there was the secretive, silent, and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked."
books,,5.0,A great book,I do not read a lot of book but this was a must read as soon as I started it.  John Grisham describes places and people like very few can do.  If you are anything like me the author must capture me in the first few pages or else I find something better to do.  Loved the book and felt it was worth the time it takes me to read
books,6 of 7,5.0,"Grisham, Baldacci, Tannenbaum - look out! Connelly's here!","Criminal defense attorney, Mickey Haller, is thrilled to find himself in the position of defending Louis Ross Roulet against a charge of attempted rape and aggravated sexual assault with grievous bodily injury for his alleged attack of Reggie Campeau, a hooker with a past. Roulet is what experienced attorneys call a ""franchise"" client - he's willing to be billed full schedule A top dollar legal fare, he's got the money to pay and he wants to go the distance in his own defense. But Roulet's compelling intensity and the story he tells disturbs and frightens Haller because, despite his rock solid prohibition against asking his client whether he did it or not, Haller becomes convinced of his client's innocence. He recalls his deceased father's advice to other lawyers, ""The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client."" Haller knows that mistakes could result in a lethal injection and the execution of an innocent man."

books,10 of 10,4.0,essential for move to Chicago,"This was my bible when I moved to Chicago 2 years ago.  It has both practical information (such as video stores, post offices, bus and train routes) on detailed neighborhood maps, as well as shopping and cuisine listings.  I used it, and recommend it, constantly.  It was far more helpful than any other city guide I tried, and over time, I knew the city well enough to put it away!  And THAT's when you're REALLY not a tourist anymore"
books,14 of 14,4.0,This book could save your life!,"I had already read and been persuaded by Dr. Fuhrman's main book, Eat to Live, that better health for many Americans was possible, and that Dr. Fuhrman was showing the way.  Cholesterol Protection for Life is a much shorter book, it is more tightly focused (on heart disease, rather than general health), and it has a stronger impact.  At least, it did for me.  I thought my diet had already become very healthy, but CPL showed me there was work yet to be done, and that it is worthwhile to do it."
books,3 of 3,5.0,"An invaluable, indispensable, illuminating, invigorating gem!","When I first picked up this book I was immediately reminded of the 'AMOK 4th Dispatch' catalogue. Back in 1989 the AMOK bookstore out of L.A. released a sourcebook for the extremes of information in print.  The book was an unbelievable find, a real jewel in the pre-internet age.  Virtually every author who appeared in the 'PULPS' section of that catalogue has found themselves listed in this new ROUGH GUIDE."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Gorgeous,"I loved this book.  A friend of mine, an English teacher, gave it to me to read because he enjoyed it so much.  He told me it was the journal of a dying man written to his young son, and I thought, ""I know I'm not going to like it."" I thought it was going to be depressing.  It wasn't.  It was sweet and wise and lovingly written.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his prayer times, his relationship with his wife, his love of his town, and his thoughts on death and aging.  There is a little bit of a plot--just enough--and a little mystery, which is nice.  But if you love good writing, this is a gift.  You'll be purring as you read it"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Classic Romance for People with Brains,"This is romance in the classical tradition --- intelligent, witty, mysterious, and haunting. I first read the book five years ago and have re-read it several times since. It is a pure pleasure to read for the beauty of the prose alone. Add to that the delights of some very interesting characters and descriptive passages that remain haunting long after the book is finished and you have a novel worthy of being called a ""romance""."
books,3 of 4,4.0,Definitely worthwhile,"""The DAM Book"" is a seminal work on a topic of considerable importance to the serious digital photographer, and Krogh clearly knows what he's talking about and does an excellent job of explaining without going overboard.

books,2 of 5,5.0,"Wow, what a debut!","I met this author at the Romance Writers of American national conference in Reno, where I learned she had been nominated for a Rita (think ""Oscars"" for Women's Fiction) for best first book.  She was such a delight that I had already decided to buy the book-even before she won the award.  I was certainly not disappointed.  I like characters with a lot of hubris, and I especially enjoy female protagonists who do not require a prince charming to ""fix"" their lives.   Even if they meet him.  Fun secondary characters (Bones is great!), too.  Terrific read-I highly recommend this book"
books,12 of 16,5.0,Chomsky for President,"This is the most lucid, convincing and rightfully scathing interpretation of American foreign policy I've ever read. Absolutely brilliant."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Into the endzone!,"Admittedly, I'm biased, because the 1942 Wisconsin Badgers won the first football game I ever saw. And what a way to get a kid started. It was one of those times when, briefly, it all came together: Heartland guys who hailed from small towns and cities and who played an extraordinary game of football for the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Names like Elroy Hirsh, Pat Harder, Dave Schreiner still resonate. Sadly the war put an end to this magic, and tragically some of the guys never made it back to pick up where they'd left off. Sportswriter Terry Frei, son of the late '42 Badger Jerry Frei, has done a remarkable job of reporting the drama and the triumphs of the season and the dedication and inevitable heartbreak that marked the war years. But despite the focus of this cleverly titled book, don't be fooled. This is an All-America story"

books,12 of 35,5.0,Keynes's General Theory versus the classical-neo. theory,"First,let's write down the core of the classical and/or neoclassical theory Keynes criticized in the General Theory.Let  p equal the price level,w equal the money wage,MPL equal the marginal product of labor,mpc equal the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,mpi equal the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods(capital or producer goods like machinery,equipment or factories)and mps equal the marginal propensity to save .For the classical- neoclassical theory,the economy is at an optimal state on the boundary of both the static and dynamic production possibilities frontiers if the following equilibrium condition holds for the aggregate labor market:w/p=MPL.For Keynes the condition is w/p=MPL/(mpc+mpi).neoclassical theory is a special case where mpc+mpi=1.Keynes's GT is mpc+mpi&lt;or=1[mpc+mpi is &lt;or= to mpc+mps=1].neoclassical theory is the special case of an econony always operating on the boundaries of both PPF's under resource scarcity so that there is an inverse relationship between consumption goods and investment goods.Only in this special case will classical/neoclassical theory be operational.In a statistical sense,classical/neo. theory assumes that on average the economy is on its boundary.The business cycle would consist of minor inflationary/deflationary gaps which would be self correcting through business inventory adjustment alone.None of this is operational if the economy is operating in the interior of either PPF's.Given the stability of the consumption function, Keynes came to the conclusion that the problem was insufficient long run investment due to a highly volatile and unstable mpi in the private sector.The result is an investment gap.Keynes's solution is not deficit finance but having the public sector borrow the inactive private financial funds at existing very low rates of interest to spend as a special capital account on a continuing series of infrastructure projects which will more than pay for themselves over time.If this policy is opposed then Keynes would be willing to copy the wasteful policy of the Egyptian pharaohs and build a series of pyramids over time.Although wasteful,such a policy would close the investment gap and lead back to the boundary of the static and/or dynamic production possibilities frontier.classical/neo. theory would then be operational as long as the mpi's unstable behavior was continually offset by increased public sector/public goods/infrastructure spending"
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Intense, brilliant","With fiction there is usually some distance between the reader and the action described.  After all, the reader is seated in a comfortable chair, one assumes, in pleasant surroundings.  But such is not the case with this novel.  The distance between this reader and the story disappeared almost from the beginning, and like the Wedding Guest in Coleridge's poem, I was dragged from Ohio to Mississippi in the heat of summer and forced to witness things I didn't want to see but could not avoid."

books,4 of 4,5.0,"""Take an ordinary business...""","I picked up ""Alpha Dogs"" as part of my typical random-reading program, and was amazed. Intensely interesting and packed with great ideas, ""Alpha Dogs"" is a must both for small-business owners and corporate bigwigs alike. Compiled by Donna Fenn of Inc. Magazine, the book examines eight extraordinary small companies."
books,1 of 1,5.0,A Favorite!,"This book has everything....Love, Greed, Murder.  What more can you ask for?  This book was one of the first romance novels I ever read, and I still have my original copy, that belonged to my mother.  I love to read it over and over again.  Luke and Roxy are two of my favorite characters.  Usually, the background characters tend to fade, but those in this book, Max, Mouse, Lily, and even Mike the dog are all memorable."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Imaginative and evocative!,"Hope Marie Bostwick is working on a new book, I am a big fan! Fields of Gold is such a multi-leveled story with history, drama, romance and the personal triumph of its lead character that it was enjoyable and engrossing in lots of ways"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Where intrepreting Kant on knowledge should begin,Allison's masterful and now classic work brings back the long ignored importance of the notion of intuition into Kant scholarship. Allison sees that only by beginning with intuition can the totality of Kant's epistemology be properly framed. Allison's work is a colossal advancement in the literature. (See also Allison's earlier _The Kant-Eberhard Controvery_.
books,5 of 5,5.0,Critical book for a critical time in history,"Dennett is very gentle in laying out his case, but his conclusions are earth shattering."
books,11 of 20,2.0,A Good Book But...,A highly detailed coverage of the Third Reich as it rose to and consolidated its power in Germany during the 1930 decade. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone interested in analysing events leading up to World War II.
books,8 of 9,5.0,Believing is Seeing,"I read this a few years back when I thought I had reached the 'zenith' of Spiritual development...I don't know why I felt this way, I guess I just thought I was 'pretty hot stuff' and I didn't think I needed to know anything else...very naive on my part...but this book blew open the doors to new levels of spiritual awareness...it made me realize at an even deeper level that nothing in our lives is ever by accident...EVERYTHING has a meaning and a purpose and a reason no matter what it looks like. Is this always easy to put into practice? Of course not, but like everything that requires some degree of effort, it is well worth it."
books,5 of 6,5.0,An Invaluable Resource for  Responsible  Consumers.,"The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices (CGEEC) is perhaps the most useful guidebook ever published for environmentally concerned consumers.  It's divided into two parts:  The first part (82 pages) describes the impact of typical consumer activities in terms of environmental damage and resources consumption.  The second part (pages 83-178) identifies the specific actions consumers (citizens) should take to minimize environmental impact.  Appendix A provides detailed descriptions of the research methods and statistical analysis, while appendix B is a comprehensive list and description of resources for consumers."
books,,5.0,Great!!,I recomend this book to every new mom. It explains everything that is happening and I knew what to expect before I went to my Dr's appointment. It told me things my doctor didn't.
books,,5.0,Pleasant read - sweet imaginary story,This story is exactly what it is supposed to be - a good story for KIDS. I don't seem to recall JK Rowling saying anything about it having a single thing to do with Harry Potter - she loved the book as a child. Had she said she loved Green Eggs and Ham someone would inevitably launch into why the flying Ford Anglia was based on the blue car Sam I Am drove up a tree. Give it a chance and form your own opinion
books,11 of 21,1.0,poor quality images,"I am disappointed with the quality of the images.  They are the quality of an ink jet printer set at draft quality.  Most of the images are so faded it is difficult to see at all.  I have returned this book, which is something I do once every 1000 books I order, and it is the first art book I have ever returned in my life."
books,1 of 1,5.0,I remember when this came out nearly 20 years ago,"I was a bookseller and this was one of the most eagerly sought after children's books of its time. And now that I have my own little 'Alexander' I am thrilled that it's still not only available, but doing so well."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Incrementalism leads to a long and painful death!,"Sticking to incrementalism will lead to a long and painful death for businesses. The only hope is innovation, especially in an age where you are not only competing with local players, but are engaged in open competition from those all around the world - some of which inherently possess lower cost structures. Innovation is the next frontier. Through innovation you'll be able to set your sights higher and create surprising experiences for your customers."
books,,5.0,Excellent book,"After I read the first installment, I passed it along to my 13 year old daughter. She has never been an avid reader, but she could not put that book down. I ordered this one specifically so she would continue reading over the summer. She enjoyed this one just as much. After her friends got through reading the books, I finally got it back and found this to be a very entertaining book as well. People can not believe that I would give a James Patterson book to my 13 year old. This is well suited for that age group. I highly recommend it"
books,13 of 14,5.0,Where de Soto started - a brave statement,"I love the little jibe provided within the title of Hernando de Soto's ""The Other Path.""  It's a poke at ""The Shining Path"" (Sendero Luminoso), the Maoist Peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de Soto's homeland beginning in 1980.  de Soto's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient.  To those who know de Soto's work, the solutions are well known: build a system of laws that allow one's residents to buy, sell and value property rights; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business."
books,2 of 2,5.0,"Prahalad on Innovation, Social Good and Profitability.","This is a well researched book in which Prahalad explores how disruptive innovation if harnessed properly can lead to huge profits for the corporations involved and high impact social well being. The key however is to get the ground breaking idea there is no set approach to getting the same, but he has  done a good job of explaining how the idea can be scaled."
books,6 of 28,2.0,Too Politically Correct,I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.
books,4 of 4,4.0,Very interesting conversations between friends,"To anyone who has wondered why Bono is the way he is, this book pretty much answers any questions you may have had.  He comes across as a very bright and caring person who has a sarcastic wit about him, but who can change gears and get into some fairly deep topics.  You also get to hear why charity is so important to him-the talks on charity were my favorite chapters.  All in all recommended for U2 and Bono fans"
books,4 of 5,5.0,The Big Picture,"So often, we tend to think of the near-extinction of the Bison as having been solely caused by overhunting by the fur trade.  This book shows the intensely interwoven cause and effect relationships that led to massive changes, not only for the Bison, but for the Native Americans as well.  The scope of this book is so much larger than just the destruction of the Bison - it addresses the full range of effects that Westward Expansion had on the plains.  To gain a better understanding of the ecological dynamics at play between the Bison, the indigenous tribes, the settlers and the environment - this book is a must"
books,1 of 2,4.0,sweet dude,"I really enjoy reading historical fiction. My librarian reccomended The Samurai's Garden to me and I really liked it. I didn't like it as much as some books I read on Japan but I think it is a worthwhile read. I prefer this one to Women of the Silk, also by Gail Tsukiyama"
books,,4.0,Well done action story for teens.,"""Ark Angel"" is my first go at an Alex Rider novel.  Even without reading the five preceding books, I enjoyed this one for what it is:  a spy novel for young adults.  Horowitz jumps right into the new story and explains previous plot lines enough for the reader to keep up.  There is virtually no character development or exploration; there are constant plot twists and turns.  Whether this is a positive or negative probably depends upon the reader.  If the reader is looking for a character to identify with, to journey with, to aspire to, Alex is a bit thin.  If the reader wants rollicking excitement without bogging down, this could be a good vein to mine."
books,,5.0,Great Book,"This book was on my summer reading list, and I was thinking that it"
books,15 of 16,4.0,Good read and interestingly translated.,"I have read the present classic book with great pleasure, but I nevertheless have had some feelings of not being completely satisfied with the editing. I happen to possess the complete translation of Ceasar's &quot;Gallic War&quot; published by an imprint of Harvard University Press and it occurred to me that in the present book several seemingly irrelevant passages have been left out. And this strikes me personally as somewhat irritating. Of course, when one does not know the difference one probably won't mind at all, but I thought it might be useful to people out there who are in the moment of deciding whether or not to by the present book to know that it is not the complete version, and should they wish to come into the possession of this complete one they should rather purchase Harvard's &quot;Gallic War&quot;. I am not trying to downgrade the present book, but it's just a matter of wishing to own a complete version of the work or not minding at all about such trivial things"
books,1 of 1,5.0,The title says it all!,"Anne Lamott is amazing!  Her metaphor for writing and for life may be a  little irreverent at times, but she tells it like it is.  The unexpected moments of humor delight us while opening us to her keen insights on life.  A manual on writing, a daily meditation, and a joyful read, Bird by Bird reaches us on many levels"
books,1 of 1,1.0,Be ready to fall asleep,"I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated"
books,6 of 9,2.0,More colonel and less general,"I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them"
books,6 of 7,5.0,Well worth the investment of your time and money,"If you are looking for a solid foundation of your interview process, take a look at this book. It provides helpful ideas on how to approach your job candidates. Can they do the job, are they willing and can they be managed.  It provided lots of helpful questions and processes for a successful hiring  process. I have to say, that I am not a professional recruiter just someone  that needs to hire and evaluate his new employees"

books,,5.0,We have seen walmart and it is us.,"Savagely funny and pointed, Dicker pulls no punches in his crystalization of the walmart juggernaut as it seeks to dominate a retail landscape near you."
books,,5.0,A must read for a sociologist/criminologist,"As a criminologist, I have a small library of books that range from sociological and crim theory to true crime and collective behavior and no book as given me more pleasure than this one.  The research is impeccable and there are so many passages that will never find their way into a textbook, so it is now my goal to utilize this work by incorporating it into my lectures.  This is a must read for anyone interested history, the impact of the industrial revolution on society and a study of the criminal mind in creating the victim-offender relationship.    Bravo to Mr. Larson."
books,0 of 2,2.0,"It could have been a winner, but alas not ...","At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well."
books,19 of 47,2.0,Save your money,"This is a collection of often old studies that the author has collected (I learned about the Harlow monkey experiments in college 30 yaers ago). His earth shattering conclusions include that we should strike a middle way between spirituality and materialism, and that often after people have bought something that they always wanted they are dissappointed. At the climax of the book he states that in order to be happy we need loving meaningful relationships and a job that provides us with satisfaction. What a shocka!!!!"

books,4 of 7,5.0,A lively look at American intellectual life in the fifties,"Norman Podhoretz is one of the most important American intellectuals of the Post- War period. His shift away from the Left toward a Conservative position helped mark a new period in American intellectual life. In this memoir he writes about the ' friends' of a former time, each of whom is a distinguished 'name' by themselves. Allen Ginsberg, Hannah Arendt, the Trillings, Lionel and Diana, Lillian Hellman and Norman Mailer. Podhoretz blends the personal anecodote with the ideological quarrel in explaining his estrangement from these friends. At one point he talks about how their radical indulgence in their own appetites led to a kind of moral chaos which he understood as destructive and damaging."
books,7 of 8,5.0,Not for Shakespeare Snobs,"Aside from people who just plain hate Shakespeare (and I don't get them at ALL), there are two types of Shakespeare Snobs.  1. The ones who think Shakespeare couldn't have written his plays because he wasn't born to nobility.  These people are idiots.  2. The ones who idolize Shakespeare to the point where, if they don't like one of his plays, He Obviously Couldn't Have Written It -- he is incapable of writing something they don't like.  Um... right.  Let's apply this rationale to a latter day artist: since Charlie Chaplin made ""The Gold Rush"", he obviously had nothing to do with ""A King in New York."""
books,1 of 3,5.0,Very insightful,"Another great book by Jared Diamond. He discusses the rise and fall of civilizations including: Mayans, Aztecs, Easter Islanders, Anasazi, etc. The environmental, social and cultural factors responsible for the demise of mass civilizations are discussed and integrated. This is a fascinating book that will change your view of history and ancient civilizations. Actually, it's pretty scary when JD compares the parallels between ancient civilizations that crumbled and our own contemporary civilizations. Very enlightening and stimulating material!!"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Very very good,I really liked this one because of the characters... and of course the background being about wine.. and the lifestyle of those who create it :)  I definitely recommend this one.
books,9 of 9,5.0,"Brando, Warts and All..","This is a sad and poignant memoir and a fine companion piece to Brando's autobiography. I wondered while reading it why Mr. Englund wasn't mentioned by name in the autobiography, but that is made clear toward the end of Mr. Englund's work. A few comments regarding the handful of negative reviews on this site. Brando's legacy as a great actor is not diminished in any way by some of the brutal revelations regarding his personal life. Perhaps a few sordid details could have been left out but I never got the sense that they were thrown in out of a sense of animus directed at Brando. In fact what comes through repeatedly is the author's deep affection for his subject, a mutual bond that was forged through their shared misfortune at having self-absorbed and destructive fathers. To their credit they achieved great material and artistic success in spite of the psychological burdens they both stuggled with throughout their lives."
books,2 of 11,4.0,Just like his books.....,"If you are familar with Sedaris and are looking for something new this isn't it. Though I've read most of his books I've never have heard him on public radio, probably because they don't appeal to my political bent. That being said, the only thing about the CD is you get to hear him read the short stories aloud. There isn't much insight into Sedaris himself. I find that once I read something I rarely read it again and the same goes for hearing something after I've read it. Very funny the first time. Not nearly as funny or entertaining the second time. Add to that his nasal annoying voice and, well, you get my drift."
books,,5.0,Funny and Profound,"I first noticed this book in a Hallmark store, bought it to give to someone, and read it myself first.  The photos are top quality shots mostly of animals mimicking various human emotions and situations.  They are the light side of the book.  The text is more weighty, but brief - I'd even call it profound.  Put together, they give the reader a fun, yet meaningful reading experience that makes an impact.  I've since purchased additional copies for gifts"
books,9 of 9,5.0,A great food trip through time.,"If your looking for it it's in this book and a whole lot more.  My favorite recipes from childhood like grasshopper pie and wafer cakes even that strange perfection salad is there.  There are recipes for mystery  cakes, heavenly hash, oh just tons of recipes each with a preface which  talks about the recipes history.  If you like history and you like food  this is a treasure.  There is a timeline of food happenings and section on  the international influences on the American palette"

books,,4.0,Good examination of the philosophical implications of evolution,"Daniel C Dennett is a very confrontational philosopher, much like Peter Singer; and like Singer, he is a strong atheist.  Dennett will brook nowhere for what he regards is muddled thinking about anything which hides the true nature of things, and for Dennett, natural science and the idea of evolution are the true nature of things."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Decent,"""Eragon"" was a great book, and much like a previous reviewer said, I read it rather quickly. It was action packed and suspensful. Eldest does a good of furthering the trilogy, and has a lot of action. Paolini leaves many questions unanswered, so you can expect an amazing final book in the series. However, despite the action, Eragon's training is incredibly boring, dull, tiresome, any other adjective that is synonymous to ""zzzzzzz"". The worse part is, that his training is half the book! There are a few good training sessions, but these are actually outside the training (if you haven't read the book you might not understand what I am getting out). Overall, it was still a good novel; and I really don't know why someone would even consider giving it anything lower than 3 stars"
books,10 of 10,5.0,This Mystery Flows to Excellence!,"In RIVER'S END, Nora Roberts uses a plot that has been used many times over the years: A story of Hollywood's glamour gone astray, and the young girl who survived it. But this isn't a typical plot by any means, not with Roberts' doing the writing. She guarantees many unexpected events along the way!"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Expand Your Mind,"This book is the only one of twelve editions that I have read. It is absolutely amazing. Not only does it question our common place world but it bends, strechtes and recreates you mind. I am looking to buy the book so I  can read it all and have the stories at my finger tips. I am also going to  read the next editions. Try one story, you will be hooked"

This past year I have purchased Avenue Q, Wicked,The boy from Oz, and Assasins on sheet music.  Unfortunately I am an intermediate pianist, so I often find myself player the right hand melody line and adding in as much of the left as I can.  All these new musicals have such difficult keys, and they change constantly throughout the songs."
books,1 of 1,4.0,couldn't put it down,"I never thought that I would read a book with a title like this. But after I started reading it, I just couldn't put it down! I laughed out loud a lot when reading this. I would recommed this book to any woman I know"
books,1 of 2,5.0,"Wow, I can't wait to read the rest!!","Retire Young Retire Rich is split up into four sections.  The fourth section is simply and closing speaking to those who may need help keeping the wind in their sails after aquireing the knowledge to fuel their finacial journey.  The first three sections are the real meat and potatoes of the book.  They not only include a collection of all of the advice, tactics, and tricks Kiyosaki's ""Rich Dad"" taught him over the years, but it also contains Kioysaki's testimonials- trajedy and triumph."

And there is much to come, I can tell.  Although I consider myself an intellectual, I am not qualified enough in mathematics to really understand what is being said on the subject, but hope that Hofstedter is going to open that up for me, too"
books,9 of 9,5.0,"2 years later, still my favorite cookbook","I've been vegetarian for 19 years and vegan-ish for 13 of those years.  I've got my share of veggie and vegan cookbooks, and this is the one I go to first.  The great feat of the book is that it makes simple, ordinary ingredients taste wonderful together.  Every recipe I've made has been a pleasant surprise at the end.  I like food spicy, and I always tend to question the spice measurements of most recipes, but Donna Klein's recipes seem to always get it just right.  I also like that the recipes are free of soy products and meat substitutes."
books,,4.0,A well written story that will keep you up,"I got this book unabridged on CD.  I would often listen to it while doing chores around the house or other mundane projects. My wife and I usually have our own books that we'll read together, but it was interesting how the story kind of pulled her in too, even though she wasn't listening to it to begin with. Upon discovering I had listened to some without her, my wife was like, ""what? You listened to it without me?!"" My response was, ""I didn't even think you were listening to it."" That's how hooked you can get on this story."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Forward thinking...,Out of Control is packed full of thought provoking ideas and ways of thinking.

books,,5.0,A grim look at the destiny of Europe,"A very thorough analysis of the contemporary trends in Western Europe from an American writer who lives there. Bawer starts with an indepth  description of the European social structure and the state of mind of the Europeans since WW2, that exposed them to the risk of being taken over by an intolerant but dedicated idealogy. He concludes that Western Europe, as we know and cherish, is moving towards its own destruction through a takeover by the wave of Muslim immigration. He points the main reasons in: the tolerance for the intolerant, by the multiculturalism that is dominating the dogmatic thinking of the European elites and by the pasivity of the Europeans who lost their respect for their own values and culture. Bawer backs his thesis by both statistical facts, quotes from local articles, lectures and report, as well as testimonies from private conversations he had with native Europeans."
books,3 of 3,5.0,"People love to own, but don't like to be sold!","That old cliche has never been more true than today. And that is very apparent by the review supposedly written by Lisa M.

It was so well written it made me feel like I were diving and hunting treasures myself!  And it has such a sweet, romantic storyline.  I was really sorry to see it end.  I hope there will be a sequel.  I recommend any woman to read this book, whether you like romance novels or not"
books,1 of 1,5.0,A very good book but you will need others,"This is my 3rd book on real estate investing and I must say that each is totally different, with different ideas and different strategies.  I think it's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know."
books,2 of 2,5.0,WHAT AN INCREDIBLE RIDE!!,"Wow, what a book!  In my opinion, considerably better than the movie.  Particularly the first 80 pages are very, very strong.  Crichton's technique of repeatedly shifting points of view -- from the doctor in the Costa Rican jungle, to the vacationing family, to one biologist, to another, and eventually to our heros, Sattler and Grant, and then Malcolm etc -- is tremendously effective.  Normally this would be confusing but somehow he pulls it off.  We can all smell what's coming -- dinosaurs! - and yet we want to see it!  We need to see it!"
books,33 of 34,5.0,Gets you to roll up your sleeves.,"I have always taken good notes and tested myself on anything that I have read to make the material come to life. After reading Think & Grow Rich and after reading so many positive reviews here, I decided to go out and buy this one as well. To tell you the truth, it was sort of anticlimatic. The exercises were good, but I pretty much figured that out for myself without the guide."
books,9 of 10,5.0,Another Excellent Book!,"Kay Francis fans and classic movie buffs should rejoice as Lynn Kear and John Rossman have written the perfect companion book to Scott O'Brien's excellent biography, ""I Can't Wait to be Forgotten"".  While O'Brien's book expertly focuses on Kay Francis' film and theater career, ""Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career"" delves deeply into Kay's private life."
books,41 of 44,5.0,Smith's moral theory actually inspires moral conduct itself.,"This book, the first published by Adam Smith, was very favorably received when it was first appeared in 1759.  Within a few generations, however, it was largely neglected due to various turns taken in moral philosophy.   Smith's approach is to paint the moral aspect of living in vivid colors, so  that it literally inspires virtuous conduct.  But in doing so, Smith never  preaches; instead, he illustrates the beauty of virtue even over the  practical advantages of living as though one were an &quot;Ideal  Observer&quot; or spectator. This perspective plays a large role in his  work, for according to Smith the moral perspective, and indeed conscience  itself, is largely a function of adopting the point of view of the  &quot;person principally concerned&quot; in morally relevant situations,  and subsequently sympathizing with the perspective of the various parties  involved.  Sympathy for Smith is not soft-heartednes (nor headedness), but  is instead identification with the motives and feelings of the parties  involved.  The volume includes one part devoted to an examination of the  history of ethical theory, interpreted through the lense of Smith's own  sentimentalist theory. One thing that should be noted about The Theory of  Moral Sentiments is that it goes a good way in correcting the impression  that Smith was a laissez-faire capitalist, and indeed the sentiments  expressed here make it clear that the popular conception of Smith as first  and foremost an economist concerned with automatic regulation resulting  from an &quot;invisible hand&quot; (a phrase used only twice in all of  Smith's writings, as explained by the editors in the excellent introduction  to this volume), do not mesh well with the historical facts.  He was a  professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University, and is reputed to have  declared himself most proud, not of his most (and justly) famous, The  Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, but of this book instead.   Indeed, his headstone reads, &quot;Here Lies Adam Smith, Author of The  Theory Of Moral Sentiments and of The Wealth of Nations.&quot; The book's  major shortcoming is its ultimately unsatisfying appeals to human nature at  junctures where people clearly have disagreements.  Smith's defense of  retributive justice is an example, for today we might well see ourselves as  involved in a struggle to move beyond such a conception of what constitutes  appropriate behavior, despite the natural propensity that we may have  toward it.   Despite its age, this book will inspire and challenge people  now struggling with moral dilemmas, and the comparatively confusing moral  climate of our own time.  It is good to see it in print, and it is good to  see moral philosophers and others beginning to discuss its significance  once again.  I recommend it highly"

books,1 of 2,2.0,760 Pages of Torture,"Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the ""secret"" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call ""soap opera"" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot"

books,2 of 3,2.0,Even if I didn't know this book was a farce...,"it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore"
books,,4.0,Great reading of a changed story.,I love listening to this book as Cindy Williams has an enjoyable voice and does a good job reading. The story is enjoyable as well but it is so changed from the book at times it bares little resembelence to it. I am not referring to the fact it is abridged and much is left out. I refer to the fact for example that a character that is a man in the book is a WOMAN on the tape. Such changes alter the structure of the story and make it into a DIFFERENT story than the one you expect to hear. If you have not read the book this is a moot point but if you have your in for some surprises
books,4 of 4,5.0,"No Fluff, Pro Advice for the Beginner Real Estate Investor","I first read this book three years ago and it still stands as one of the best books I have ever read on real estate investing. If you have read any amount of REI books you know that this area of publishing it is flooded with 'motivational' books that are full of fluff and short on details (Rich Dad series comes to mind). Suzanne P. Thomas's book delivers the real info that you are looking for. She offers pro insights on cashflow, down payment, selecting a property, different loans to consider, marketing, finding the best tenants, day-to-day details, etc. The focus is on single family rentals, but the info can be applied to most real estate investing situations. If you are a beginner investor this is the book you want to start with."
books,,5.0,For CREATIVE people... not linear people...,"Lee Silber has written a book with a plethora of ideas in an extrememly valuable way: from one creative person to another.  If you are looking for a book to take care of all your self promotion problems, you probably have so many issues that a book on self promotion will not help you.  But for the CREATIVE person who needs to prime the pump--this book is a goldmine.  Not all of these ideas will work for you.  Surely something will.  Sometimes the author offers simple advice (i.e., ""smile"").  However, the simple can be the most profound.  Think about it.  How many people to do you know and interact with that if they took that one piece of Silber's advice (to smile)--they would go to a whole new level of personal effectiveness!  So this is not a read for the linear folks who want to the expert to tell them how to solve all their issues.  That's called a normal book--and there are plenty of those out there.  This is an awesome book with practical ideas for CREATIVE people who will love Silber's smorgasboard style of writing.  I loved the book precisely because it's content and methods are out of the ordinary, simple, doable, and FUN!  I enjoyed this book so much that I read most of the ""creative"" series he has written as well"

books,5 of 5,5.0,Knowing the Unknown,"I first read this book in early 1994. It left a lasting impression on me. The account of Abraham Lincoln's life is remarkably written by Dale Carnegie. This is not the story about the Lincoln that we learned about in school. Lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest Presidents. Mr. Carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the White House. We can see the problems that Lincoln had while in the office of President. It would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if Lincoln had not been President because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable. For example, the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made Lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in Political Science or just wants to know more about the President. This is a very interesting book that I found hard to put down. I have read this many times and I cherish each moment that I spend reading the book"
books,41 of 80,1.0,Not recommended,"This book has been replaced with better, more accurate information, free of the far left-wing slant of ... Morris.  I suggest Prof. Uri Dan's excellent four volume set 'Israel's War of Independence' which is far more detailed and accurate than this [book]"
books,23 of 24,5.0,A 'must' For All Dog Owners,"As a lover of dogs for over 50 years, I own dozens of books about canine care and behavior, but Stanley Coren's 'How to Speak Dog' is definitely my favorite. I originally found this informative dog communication book in my local library after adopting a lovable but fearful mixed breed from my local humane society five years ago. Since then, I have bought at least six copies of this same book online, just to have on hand to give to friends and family who decide to bring a dog into their life or who don't understand the behavior of a dog already living with them. I especially like the book's detailed descriptions of a dog's specific body language (ears, eyes, mouth, tail) and what each means--as well as its guide to the messages a dog is sending when he barks or whines in a particular way. Not unlike a driver's training manual which must be read by those who wish to become licensed drivers, 'How to Speak Dog"" should be required reading for every person who decides to share his or her life with a dog."

books,6 of 18,1.0,This Man Doesn't See Patients...,"Do any of you positive reviewer even know that ""Dr."" Breggin doesn't even see patients anymore? That in nearly 2 years all he has done has traveled the country to testify in courts against psychiatrists? That is, in states which haven't yet discredited him for being biased and unscientific. I find it amazing that a man who hasn't treated a psychiatrist patient in years can write a book so skewed and wrong that it can endanged the public and still be published. What bothers me more is that people think he's correct. Modern medicine does not know the reason that the pancreas produces less insulin than normal, they only know that it does, so maybe diabetics should stop taking insulin and try to figure out if they were raised improperly by their mothers. Sound crazy? Of course, but this is the message that he's advocating. He should be ashamed of himself. He is not a real doctor and should return his diploma. Edit: 12/21/05---take about misunderstanding...Karellen's comments above are typical of those attacking something they know little about, making me wonder if Karellen believes in aliens like Tom Cruise. I said nothing about when the book was written and that is irrelevant to the point of the review which is that Breggin's opinions are so biased that he has been discredited by state courts in this country. I was trying to avoid posting websites, but since you posted one I'll post one too: http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/breggin.htm"

Having read almost every grief book out there, don't waste your money, just buy this one and learn to live again."
books,5 of 5,2.0,Writing 2 to 3 books per year equals poor quality reading,"I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns,  historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price.  Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity.  This book was fluffy & dull"
books,47 of 68,2.0,Not helpful if you are look ing for serious solutions,"This book is a collection of Q &amp; A's where Donaldson responds to people who ask her advice about their particular dog problems. Although some generalizations can be made from the problems included, it's hard to know how to generalize--i.e. whether and how a suggestion given to one owner makes sense in your own case. This means that this book is at best marginally useful for people who want and need detailed advice on how to reform their dog's behaviour. If you have a serious problem, don't look for reliable solutions in this book of anecdotes"

The book is almost 600 pages long and written in a style that requires college-level analysis to understand. My review can hardly do it justice but hopefully it might encourage you to buy it or at least to check it out of the library for a couple of weeks of interesting reading."
books,,5.0,A helpful book for writing in a business setting,"Let's face it. Most books about writing are  b o r i n g. They usually range from dry to ... dry. I've often thought of this as a case of ""physician, heal thyself."" Ryan's ridiculously long title made me wonder if his book would land squarely in the middle of that dry pile. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong: Ryan has a straightforward and practical approach to writing. In fact, he goes as far as to talk about writer's intuition, and dares to promote a straightforward writing approach, ""Plan Then Write."" This book talks about general corporate writing, but the information can be applied to other types of writing where we need to remember that every word we write, whether in team communication or in our work product, is an opportunity. This book is great for less experienced writers trying to find structure in a formless void. And it is perhaps equally valuable for experienced writers who are trying to call themselves back to the basics"

It also helps highlight some of those ""everything I need to know, I really did learn in Kindergarten"" moments.  Often I don't keep textbooks, because I know I'll never use most of them again.  This book is exactly the opposite, in that I know I will use it again, be it with relationship conflicts, time management, a reminder to detach from my identities, or anything else.  There is such a wealth of helpful information, that I fail to understand the ranting low reviews.  Apparently some people have nothing better to do with their time than bitch.  Pity, really"

Just as a sentient being is born, forms, grows, molds, progresses, digresses, deteriorates, ages, decays and dies, so it is with cultures and civilizations. In this case, a culture in its childlike creative ability solidifies into non-creative matter, stagnant, authoritarian and brittle and then dies."

Dr. Alexander Elder, has a psychiatric background what makes him extremely powerful in explaining what is actually happening with the mind and with the masses who are trading. It gave me as a novice a deep and thorough understanding of what makes the market move. He also gave me as a starting trader excellent idea's and rules on money management which is absolutely crucial. I personally have this book on my number 1 for people who want to learn trading and get a deeper understanding of their own behavior and possible dangers. Beside that lots of practical tips and strategies are given. The book is an excellent book for the beginner and the advanced trader who needs to review his own behavior"

books,9 of 9,4.0,Very Good,"This is the second volume of a 3 volume history of the Third Reich.  As with the first volume, this is a substantial work of synthesis of the enormous literature about the Third Reich.  Evans has aimed at producing a work that can be read usefully by scholars and by the general reading public.  Evans has largely succeeded by producing a massively documented and very well written book.  Evans has also made the book more accessible by avoiding a strictly chronological approach.  He covers a series of topics related to the social and economic history of the Reich and concludes with foreign policy and the outbreak of war.  Reflecting his prior research interests, the sections on the social history and structure of the Third Reich are excellent.  The final section, covering foreign policy and diplomacy, is less thorough, though this is a twice told tale.  Several unifying features emerge.  One is the Nazi intent to reshape German, indeed European, society along the lines envisioned by their peculiar Social Darwinist ideals.  The second is the success of the Nazi state in 'coordinating' almost all the institutions of German life with their ideology.  A third is the primacy of Hitler's decisions.  A final is the obsessive goal of an aggressive war to conquer Eastern Europe, which often distorted other Nazi social and economic policies.  On completion, this trilogy will be a standard reference work for this period."
books,8 of 8,5.0,"No winners, just different degrees of loss","I've read many of Grisham's novels, and this remains my favourite.  It addresses complex issues and does not attempt to gloss them over.

books,9 of 9,5.0,Amazing!,"I would reccomend this book to anyone who is or knows an addict. It provides clear information on the topics of addiction, addictive logic, stages of addiction, the Addict, recovery, and how to help. It clarifies a compicated topic into language anyone can understand and gives one a true sense of just what ANY addiction- drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, food- is really all about. It explains all the elements of addiction thouroughly and is a must have for an addict or family member."
books,4 of 9,4.0,Elegantly written yet dated,"First, I would compliment Jim Paris' intelligent review.  Mr. Paris leaves  me little to add.  What Mr. Barzini did not foresee was the radical changes  the last forty years would have on Italian culture.  Divorce would never be  acceptable to the Italian people, writes Barzini confidentally.  Yet only a  few years after this book came out, divorce was legalized in Italy.  Mr.  Barzini must have really be perplexed when the next level of cultural  degeneration was achieved- abortion rights.  Writing in the Italy of  circa-1960, Mr. Barzini must not have thought the concept of abortion would  ever be a part of Italian life.  Yet abortion became commonplace in Italy  within Mr. Barzini's lifetime.  He must of felt a foreigner in his own land  that he so much loved"
books,23 of 23,4.0,"generally good, although not complete","The selections in this collection match the selections featured on the RENT - selections album. Unfortunately, this means that many of the best songs in the full score are cut out (including: Light my Candle, La Vie Boheme... I Should Tell You, etc.), because they involve sung dialogue rather than &quot;liftable&quot; songs (songs that work out of context). Another drawback is that in general, songs written for a rock band (featuring extensive guitar) do not transcribe well to solo piano (guitar chords are included in this book, though). With this in mind, however, there is still a lot of good things about this collection. Larson's great ballad-esque songs, like &quot;I'll cover you,&quot; &quot;Your eyes,&quot; &quot;Without You,&quot; and &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; work very well as piano/vocal. Other, more rock-sounding songs such as &quot;Rent,&quot; &quot;Out tonight,&quot; and &quot;What you own&quot; are still doable. As written they may sound a little awkward, but people who have had experience playing rock piano may find that with a little fiddling with the written notes a decent version can be produced. Even if you don't have experience playing rock piano, if you have more experience playing other Broadway music you can still learn a lot from working with these songs and trying out different things. Other songs included are: &quot;Take me or Leave me,&quot; &quot;Another Day,&quot; &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;Santa Fe.&quot; &quot;Take me&quot; didn't transcribe well (esp. the vocal line) due to the bluesy pitches of the song, but the main riff and the chords are accurate. &quot;Another day&quot; contains both the rock elements and the balladesque elements, but the rock elements do not require many changes.&quot;Halloween&quot; transcribes faithfully and works well; &quot;Santa Fe&quot; is transcribed well, but since much of it is spoken it is also a little odd. Overall this book is well done. The songs are all faithful in spirit to the album, although at times a pitch is written differently from the orig. broadway cast recording. The song where this is most apparent is in &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; where it appears that the two soloists' lines were mostly improvised. Although I usually prefer for a song's accompaniment to reflect the actual full score, in the case of these songs such accompaniment is repetitive and adding the vocal line (which is actually a very standard practice for vocal selections) was very welcome. RENT has become a part of the modern musical theater canon, and so this book has become necessary for any Broadway-lover's sheet music collection"

books,12 of 15,5.0,A great book for beginners in investing!,I thought this book was great for my first book on investing.  My husband and I are getting ready to invest in our first property and I wanted to be a part of our investments so I am starting with educating myself.  This book was really inspirational and motivating which helps when taking a risk.  It shows that anyone can invest no matter what income you have to start with.  I would highly suggest reading this book if investing is something your thinking of doing.  I hope you enjoy!
books,1 of 1,5.0,25th Anniversary Edition is the Best!!!!!!!,"Over the 25 years of my sales career, I have purchased many copies of 'How To Master The Art of Selling' Some I have given away, others literally fell apart from constant rereading, highlighting and so on."
books,4 of 6,5.0,A book of books.,"Nafisi's memoir, ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"", takes its readers deep into the life of a woman living under the ever increasing repression of the Iranian regime.  She is an academic whose love of books drives her to use them as lenses through which to view the horrifying events that surround her. Each of the book's four sections takes the works of a different author and uses them to illuminate aspects of the oppressive Islamic regime under which she lives. The book presents a startlingly vivid picture of day to day life in Iran as suffered by a woman who, though very intelligent, is unsure of whether her allegiances lie with her government or with the west. Though Nafisi explains the political events surrounding the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war, she does so not from the view of the history that's been written, but from the view of a citizen living in the times, providing an essential shift in perspective."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Great for newcomers and suburbanites.,"This helpful guide includes lots and lots of maps for tons of neighborhoods, as well as other useful information. Recommended for people relocating to Chicago, suburbanites who have reasons to come into the city every once in a while, or locals who just want to get to know other parts of the city better."

books,,4.0,Magic is not all that can be deceptive,"It is difficult to find books in this genre that have a new flare to them. Usually the story lines are similiar as well as the characters. This had some of that, but the magical part of it, made for a new twist to the average story line."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent  Post Corps History of the Explorers,"The book contains outstanding personal histories of every individual that left a record after their return to St. Louis. Some of the amazing men include John Colter who left the corps on the return leg after three years with Lewis and Clark to turn back northwest with a small group of trappers. Like George Drouilliard, Colter spends time in the remote country in constant danger from the powerful Blackfeet. Although only one man died on the Lewis and Clark expedition, many of the men that return meet death at the hands of the Indians or natural diseases of that era. George Shannon, loses a leg in a second trip north and becomes quite successful, some like Nathaniel Pryor virtually live with the Indians (Osage) and a few live a very long life like Patrick Gass. Their lives intersect such famous mountain men such as Jedediah Smith, Hugh Glass, young Jim Bridger and the controversial Edward Rose.  The author has done phenomenal research that documents all the Corps participants including the death of Sacagawea, although there is some controversy noted in the Appendix.  Her husband Charbonneau lives a long life that is quite useful, in spite of Lewis' opinion, for others plying the Missouri. Of course Clark's life is well documented and known but Clark did a wonderful job keeping up with the survivors actually maintaining a log on all participants up through the late 1820's. Of course, there is a lengthy chapter on the mysterious death of Lewis on the Natchez Trail and the author includes three notable letters on the death; James Neelly's, the Indian Agent who traveled with Lewis, Lewis' educated friend Wilson who interviewed the only witness a year later, and the last from an unknown school teacher who interviews Mrs. Grinder one last time many years after. Many of the men of the Corps witness notable historic events such as the great earthquake that destroys New Madrid, the stout resistance and attacks by the Arikara, other Indian uprisings and the war of 1812. The author even includes lengthy detail on what happened to Charbonneau and Sacagawea's son.  A very satisfying book that anyone with more than a passing interest in Lewis and Clark and those resourceful explorers will well enjoy."

books,1 of 1,4.0,Redeemed!,"After being very disapointed in ""True Believer"" I felt this novel was much more realistic and connected better to the characters. He has redeemed himself in my opinion with this novel. A good easy read, very enjoyable."
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Very True Side of Human Nature,"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics."
books,5 of 5,5.0,Had trouble putting this one down...,"Charlie Bone is one of many of the children of the red king. His 'gift' is the ability to see a photograph and 'hear' the events that pertain to the time in which the photo was taken. The Yewbean's are ancestors of Charlie and relatives to the Red King as well. When the book opens, we read about Henry Yewbean, who is tricked and sent into the future with a marble sized ball called the 'Time Twister'. When there, he meets Charlie Bone, a descendant of his from the Henry's future. The story is about Charlie helping Henry escape from Bloor's Academy, which is an academy for gifted students, run by Henry's cousin, Ezekiel, where Charlie is a student and Henry is stuck there because of Ezekiel's plot to kill him. After many mistakes and misadventures, Charlie and Cook, along with several of Charlie's friends and his uncle, Paton, help Henry escape and return to his little brother, who is now in his 90s, because he is unable to return to his own time, for reasons explained in the book. With lots of twists and turns, this book definitely will keep the reader turning pages. Great for children, teens, and even adults. All in all, a pretty good story"

books,4 of 8,2.0,The Crossing - Back and forth to Mexico,"The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all."
books,2 of 4,4.0,Palestine since 1945,"Some reviews of Shlaim's ""Iron Wall"" suggest incorrectly that it explains the roots of Arab-Jewish conflict over Palestine. In fact the book offers only a 27-page ""prologue,"" insightful and well written but largely based on secondary and tertiary sources and far too limited in scope. So far the best work on this topic remains the somewhat formal and pedantic first 129 pages of Kimmerling's and Migdal's ""Palestinian People."" Shlaim's book provides notably concise summaries, so effective that the first one or two pages of each chapter provide enough information for a first reading of the book"
books,4 of 10,5.0,My favorite cookbook of the year!,This cookbook is simply devine.  Suzanne is right on the tip of what American cooking should be about right now. Her food is modern without being pretentious. I love her little comments and tips before each recipe.  I can't wait to try some of the recipes.
books,0 of 5,1.0,Peter Smith hardcover WARNING!!!,"If you're considering buying the Peter Smith ""edition"" of this book, note that it is NOT a new ""edition"" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book"

books,,4.0,A thougth provoking one,"A book which has been conceptualized well and organized well.  The author brought up some good experiences to justify his points.  The experiences are a well mix of good and bad.  It has been very well described on how one can steer clear even when there is enough obstruction.  Particularly, the chapters where he described how Intel has evolved to a microprocessor company from a memory company; how the RISC/CISC confusion resolved; are superb.  The author also nicely explained his inidividual take on how to intercept the right message from the noise."
books,5 of 15,5.0,"Helpful, and innovative",Buying Scott's book can help anyone. A wise choice and well thought out and written
books,12 of 13,5.0,A toolbox and tutorial for the working Perl programmer,"This book is for experienced working Perl programmers - most likely system administrators but not necessarily - that need working solutions to real problems you'll most likely find in the workplace. There are a few diversions into such ""cute"" ideas as building animations in Perl, but most of these hacks are for the working programmer who is looking for ways to automate processes, build interfaces that don't get in the way of developers, and thoroughly test and simulate code. Amazon does not show the table of contents so I review this book in the context of the table of contents."
books,4 of 5,5.0,A great reference,"This book is well presented, reads well and is an elegant and useful tool for anyone who has anything to do with type. As a professional designer, I enjoyed reviewing what I knew and found a number of things that were helpful in my everyday work. I count this among my favorite references"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent Summary of Important Thinking,"In many ways this audio CD is better than the book it is based on. Goleman's writing style can be stodgy, but his audio presentation is very good and it is great to hear the author emphasising the lessons that he thinks are important. Buy this if you use EI in business"
books,1 of 2,5.0,Good read for the open minded person,"I thought this book was a good read. I don't totally agree with all of Chomsky's views, but getting an semi-alternative view was good. I think he does press a little too much by accusing the US and Israel of being terrorist. We (the US) didn't specifically target civilians by hitting the towers, but I think the book sheds light on that we were involved in activities that killed many innocent people, not that we wanted people dead but to maintain control. I can't agree that with Chomsky that we shouldn't have played a role in Afghanistan during the 80's. It was a good way to indirectly hurt the Soviet Union. But our previous administrations foreign policies failed to protect us with what happened on 9-11. If something remotely similiar happens again, then the Bush administration has failed. The book is good to read if you are open-minded and not-biased against or for the US, Israel, or who ever. Chomsky makes the US look bad so if you the American thats refuses to accept our wrongdoing don't read it. If you are anti-Bush and whatever, reading it might fuel your bias. If you are more moderate then its a great book to give you some things to think about but don't take everything to seriously but seriously don't outright deny any possiblities"
books,7 of 7,4.0,Good read,"This book is a good read.  Two others that were better for me from a walking program perspective are:  ""The 90-Day Fitness Walking Program"" by Mark Fenton (GREAT walking program for the couch potato beginner - starts w/ 10 minutes a day and gradually works up to 30 minutes a day - also not an information overload for a beginner) and ""Walking Magazine The Complete Guide To Walking: for Health, Fitness, and Weight Loss"" by Mark Fenton (this is the one i'm using now - great walking program schedule and tons of very good info on keeping variety in your fitness routine).  If you can afford them, get all three. (I also like ""The Sprited Walker"" by who I forget, for motivation.)  If not, start w/ the ""The 90-Day Fitness Walking Program"" by Mark Fenton and maybe this Prevention one to get you additionally fired up"
books,2 of 19,5.0,The Right Time to Publish a Comprehensive Book on Atheism,"Dawkins did a great job of presenting the current scientific position of atheism. The book can guide the debates between believers and nonbelievers.  It is nice to hear Dawkins say that his mind is open if God's existence is proven.  His book is thus timely because my  scientific proof of God's existence did arrive at Internet book stores this summer. (Search on ""The First Scientific Proof of God."") A am waiting for reviews of this proof. A scientific proof of God's existence was possible earlier because the `scientific method' was found during the Renaissance. However, at that time, Science and Theology were becoming two distinct fields of thought."
books,,5.0,Praise for Diana Gabaldon,"This is the last book in a wonderful series by Diana Gabaldon.  It is simply great.  She has a very engaging way of writing that puts you in the book and lets you experience what is happening as if you are there.  It is obvious to me that she thoroughly researches her book's time frames as they refer not only to people, but to their way of living and to the sciences available.  I am not a history buff, but I have learned more (and enjoyed it) reading her books than I have learned from any other source to date!"

books,8 of 9,5.0,One of the best treatments of the Indochina war,"If I were stranded on a desert island with only one book to read about the Vietnam War, Sheehan's ""A Bright And Shining Lie"" would undoubtedly be it.   The book is not a linear history of the Vietnam War but instead tells the tale from one of its most important players and critics, John Paul Vann, who served as an in different capacities from the ""advisory"" period under Kennedy in 1962 to just after the 1972 North Vienamese Easter offensive, when he was killed in a helicopter crash."

books,,2.0,The House is Not a Home Run,"The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this"
books,,5.0,Wonderful Story,Faith is a beautiful older woman that puts up with her husband's coldness in their marriage just because she doesn't realize what he's doing to her. She has two daughter's Ellie and Zoe whom mean the world to her. It's not until she decides to go back to law school that her husband begins to treat her worst by the minute. Both of her daughters are no longer at home and it's not until she meets up with a childhood friend Brad that she begins to see what she could have. Coming back from a trip a day early she finds out that her husband has been unfaithful to her and she finds hope for her future in the childhood friend named Brad whom happens to be married. Faith and Brad get closer as time goes by and the rest is a fairytale come true. In my opinion this book was one of  D.S.'s best
books,2 of 3,4.0,Good addition to the series....,This is the 3rd book in this most excellent series. First of all I would like to say that this book splits it's time between following Prince Arutha on his quest for Silverhorn and Pug and his search for answers about the danger they face. As with the other books in the series the story grips you and the action is plenty. I would say that Arutha's quest for Silverthorn is almost like a side quest in terms of the whole plot. It does help to introduce new aspects of the plot and it also has young Jimmy the Hand in the spotlight. I like how his character is developing. I also hope that his relationship with the &quot;Upright Man&quot; is further explored in later books. The one main gripe I have is how easy this books' main bad-guy was dispatched. You are made to believe that he is much more powerfull then he turns out to be. Everything is always wrapped up in a neat package at the end. Would not be so bad to see a good guy get his head kicked in (Lyam????)from time to time. Having said that I ordered the 4th book in the series within hours of finishing this
books,6 of 6,2.0,Half of the book is blank reserved for notes!,"Pages 38 to 97 -- half the book -- is just blank space for notes, which you could just as well write in a 10-cent, 70-page notebook spiral. The beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms, with some bulletted questions here and there"
books,3 of 3,5.0,Absolutely terrific work!,"This is the first book by kindred that i've read.  i knew of him mostly as a columnist for the sporting news who seemed to dislike everyone and everything, especially anything new or unusual.  but i have always been fascinated by both cosell and ali, and was willing to give this a shot.....thankfully.  this is one of the best sports books of recent years: cosell and ali as individuals and their relationship (which in reality took place almost fully onscreen) is covered in full, but the author also shows these incredibly complex characters, warts and all, as they maneuver through their respective careers."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Delicious Nostalgia for American Cooks,"This book is a treasury of true American cooking, with the recipes our mothers and grandmothers loved,and that make fond memories for us. Some are still favorites for family and entertaining (Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Stroganoff Casserole), others beg to be rediscovered (Imagine! Coca-Cola Salad), all provide fascinating reading, with their accompanying histories, orginal ads and illustrations. &quot;American Century&quot; has rapidly become one of my favorite cookbooks, both for browsing and for adding to my collection of recipes that please and amaze"

If you beleive or dont beleive in love, this book is a great book to read.  it opens your eyes to a whole new world and things you never thought were even possible.  i read this book in 1 1/2 days and i loved it.

I imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript, but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers"

It doesn't work like that. Even at his best he was miserable, suicidal. The answer is God. Plain and simple. He is the only thing that Tolstoy discovered would lead him to a more peaceful,satisfying life. This was a great book"

books,,5.0,Not for the faint of heart,"Since this is one of many previous reviews, I will be brief. This is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever read. But not the easiest one. The first time I read it I felt overwhelmed and undereducated, until I saw a another book written as a companion to the novel. It helped a lot with the unfamiliar cultural references, of which there are many. And I felt better. I read it a second time, on a couple of flights back and forth across the Pacific (perfect place - you're captive, with few distractions). And it took a few more hours than that to finish. In the end, if you can read no other novel, or if you are going to be isolated on an island with no chance of escape, and can take a book to read, take this one. You won't regret it"
books,39 of 39,5.0,The Best Available Reference in English,"This book's low average rating is, unfortunately, a reflection not of its quality, but of the error of a previous reviewer whose mistake was to expect the book to be a basic grammar rather than a reference grammar for more advanced students. Put simply, there is no better Latin reference grammar available in English. If there is, I am not aware of it. This is the only Latin grammar that rivals Smyth's Greek Grammar in its depth and clarity. That said, students should note that this is a thorough descriptive reference grammar, not a grammar meant to teach Latin or to provide the intermediate student with a basic reference. Those seeking a simpler reference more suitable to the intermediate level may benefit from Bennet's grammar of the same title"
books,1 of 4,5.0,Mobius strip,"This is the beginning of the posthumous work of Mishima.  You will follow the lives of four people who got reincarnated in different time and in different place with Honda.  His flowing and elegant style hits the highest and psychological descriptions, that even characters did not realized themselves so well, are so elaborated and sometimes scare us.  It seems like weaving beautiful tapestry and you can feel the person of genius and bliss for enjoying the output of the genius.  But you may lost at the end like this story and come back to this story again and again"

books,6 of 7,5.0,great book and perfect chance to reevaluate your life!,"OK--I loved the book and agreed with the basic premise that Americans sure need to take a good look at their lifestyles---the whole materialistic overconsumption thing is really disgusting once you recognize it-I have read several books with this similar theme(Kalle Laasen, Naomi Klein,Travels of a t-shirt in a global society, etc) and the more I read the more ""stuff"" I eliminate from my life- I do not think that all the kids are as bad as some of those out there think- and not everyone is so pathetic and greedy as the book points out--it is just better imagery to paint a portrait of an America that has lost itself in a self-centered materialistic mire- I have 4 kids who do not get everything they want--they do chores--they learn to behave and show respect and they work hard. I know so many parents just like me and there are many very close neighbors in my neighborhood and others in my town. There are block parties, people help eachother out (not only after disasters either) and life goes on--no--we do not live in some imaginary Eutopia--we live 0n the East Coast- we work jobs and save money for our childrens college etc-- I say all this because although I agree with the book that American culture as a whole is going down the tubes,I think there are many people who are living in America that are resisting this cultural downfall--I do wish that this book could be required reading in schools !!! Sometimes it is difficult to get my teenagers to understand my rantings!! It is worth the effort and if each of my kids and all those other great kids out there can recongnize the   games advertisers play and can resist the temptations toward overconsumption that is pushed on them-then they will lead us into a fine future. Lets encourage the ""counter-materialistic-culture"" and pass the reading along!!"

The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core.  The only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game.

His viewpoint incorporates modern scholarship and sensibilities and avoids the traditional oatmeal that America is always right and good, but not in a particularly accusatory or condemning way. For example, it exposes Jackson, Sherman, and others for their mistreatment of the Indians but doesn't actually condemn them. It explains Washington and Jefferson's ownership of slaves without apologizing for them."
books,13 of 14,5.0,The great Classic of Oxford Ordinary Language Philosophy,"In a sense, this book is a mirror to the problems covered in Wittgenstein's &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;--albeit with tighter arguments and far less meandering than Wittgenstein's groundbreaking work (this was published three years before Wittgenstein's posthumous PI). Both men were dedicated to freeing philosophy from what Ryle terms &quot;category errors&quot;--misapplications of the ordinary referential scope of a given term (&quot;mind&quot; as a  concept which must necessarily oppose &quot;substance&quot; for instance--this duality forces us to ascribe and essentialize qualities to the incorporeal along the same lines as that of substance, by giving it attributes on the linguistic model of physical objects) These misapplications have led philosophers into vast problems which, by their very nature as linguistic misuses, are unsolvable (but not dis-solvable). Parts of it will provoke cries of &quot;behaviorism!&quot;, but Ryle included a chapter near the end distancing his stance from Skinner et al. (how well he manages in this is debatable!) Brilliant, straightforward, and elegant, this is one the best works of 20th-century philosophy"
books,2 of 5,5.0,One of the most influencial books I've read this year.,"Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased. I found myself taking extra time and care in reading ""And The Band Played On"" just to let the information sink in."
books,3 of 4,4.0,Get's Better,Now the story picks up and get's interesting again. The characters that you have grown to know and care about are in a safe house. This book is quicker to read and the story moves at a fast pace. You can't put it down because you want to see what happens next
books,,2.0,Doesn't live up to the hype,"As a stand-alone story (not a ""prequel""), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing!"
books,4 of 4,5.0,"Beautiful book, beautiful meals","Gorgeous, four-color book stuffed with easy, delicious recipes. Every time I cook one of these deceptively simple dishes, I can't believe that I made anything so delicious! Or that it came out so perfectly! Thank you, Jacques"
books,4 of 5,5.0,Tacoma Confidential - Balanced Writing,"Mr. LaRosa has done a very good job of laying out the information, in a balanced manner, concerning a tragic incident that had a very convoluted and contentious history.  He also rightly raises important questions that remain in the aftermath and deserve to be asked.  This book is well-written and its reading moves quickly"

books,48 of 49,5.0,Jean Donaldson understands dogs!,"I love Dogs are from Neptune and Culture Clash, both by Jean Donaldson.  This expert trainer is also a thoughtful and engaging writer. By really moving into and explaining the mind of the dog, Donaldson goes beyond a training how-to.  Instead, she gives me, as the trainer of my own dogs, the tools I need to figure out how to solve my own training problems.  It has caused me to think about my dogs and how I train in a whole new way.  If I wasn't training my dogs, I'd still read these books because they make me laugh (a lot)"

books,1 of 1,4.0,bone detective review,"This book is a great, fun to read biography on Diane France. It would be a very good book to read if you are intrested in science. It is very well written and it explains Diane France's life, her career, and what a forensic anthropologist is."
books,5 of 12,1.0,Cotton Candy Dragons,"This book has several problems which keep me from recommending it to anyone. It book presents most, if not all, dragons as wise and helpful to humans. It is we humans (especially Christians) who make dragons into evil monsters. Many of the ""facts"" about dragons presented are sugar-coated, if not outright wrong. I have to wonder how wise this is if you are planning to go summoning otherworldly entities in ritual. For example, Fafnir is supposeldey the ""Ruler of Dragons of the South"", roughly analogous to the guardian of the watchtowers of the south. There is also a description of Fafnir's mythology, which describes how Fafnir is slain by the Germanic hero Sigurd. Fafnir, while dying, warns Sigurd that Sigurd's treacherous ""friend"" Regin is about to kill him. However, any other book of Germanic or European mythology will tell you a more complete version of the story: Fafnir and Regin were human brothers, who killed their father for his hoard of treasure, among it the cursed ring Andvarinaut. Fafnir then took all of the treasure for himself, changing himself into a dragon to protect his twice stolen hoard. Not exactly the sugar 'n' spice version of dragons presented in this book, and somthing to seriously consider before you invite him to be invoved with your rituals. Come to think of it, many of the ""dragons"" presented here are not. Many are simply large serpents or other mythical beings labelled as dragons. The illustration of ""The Goddess Tiamat"" clearly has a [...], and is called in Mesopotamian Mythology books an Imdugud, or Lion-eagle."
books,0 of 5,4.0,"Okay, but too short","Didn't know what to expect.  Thought it might be difficult reading for some reason.  Turns out it was pretty easy.  I guess it just gives you a lot to think about instead of looking up words and things like that.  I think it could have been a 4.5-5 star book if the story would have been expanded upon to at least 500pp, or at least long enough to develop the characters"
books,7 of 8,4.0,Building AJAX and PHP skills with Packt: Recommended,"The book is good, the topic is right, and pretty much everyone is thrilling to learn how to benefit from AJAX -- even if this means you're going to use a lot of JavaScript, which you thought it was not necessary, since you know PHP, a powerful language, right?"

books,0 of 12,1.0,The little white horse,"Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one"
books,4 of 9,2.0,Good enough to make you wish it were better.,"I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. (""Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!"") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are ""right-o, jolly-good"" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK"

books,2 of 4,5.0,'The meaning of life is within us ',"The starting point of this work always fascinated me. Here is a great genius of mankind, recognized throughout the world as an immortal creator of Literature. He is the father of a large family and has a wife he has loved and who has loved him. He has great wealth .In other words here is a person who seems to have almost everything most human beings strive for in their lives and do not attain in any way close to the level at which he has attained them. And yet it all turns meaningless to him, and he in despair asks the question of whether there is anything to truly live for, what can give life true meaning. For he too senses that Death will take him and all his worlds, and their meaning away."

books,3 of 4,5.0,In the melting pot,"At first, I thought that Smith was mining the same ground as Andrea Levy's SMALL ISLAND: examining the lives of immigrants in postwar London and tracing the routes that had brought them there. But while Smith does not quite have Levy's intensity, she spreads her net wider, dealing with several different cultures (Bengali, Jamaican, Jewish intellectual, and British working-class) over a span of three generations, only the first of which coincides with Levy's. Eventually it becomes clear that her main focus is on the youngest generation (presumably her own), and she chronicles the troubled nineties with sharp observation, vivid and often colloquially profane language, and considerable humor. I felt that the narrative lost coherence and the plotting became less plausible as the number of characters increased, though it may just be that I had less time to read. But Smith's central theme --- the difficulty of maintaining cultural identity in a strange land --- is extremely well addressed and chillingly relevant"
books,2 of 3,2.0,Not up to par...,"This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard"
books,34 of 37,4.0,"Enjoyed it, skeptically",I was one of the new American Spectator subscribers David Brock writes about who were influenced by Rush Limbaugh and Mr. Brock's earlier writings. I devoured anything anti-Clinton that was written during the early 90s and I was convinced that the sitting President was an immoral villain who deserved the castigation he received from the honorable Republicans who relentlessly pursued him.
books,,4.0,Not Connelly's best,"Back from retirement, Detective Harry Bosch is still haunted by the kidnap and disappearance of Marie Gesto from 1993.  Now serial killer Raynard Waits is willing to lead police to Marie's grave as part of a plea bargain ensuring he will not receive the death penalty.  When Waits escapes during the outing and the tape filming the event is obviously doctored, Harry suspects politics and career advancement are involved and that, perhaps, Waits hadn't killed Marie after all but only been told how to find her grave."
books,3 of 8,1.0,Utter disappointment,"Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining."

books,2 of 2,5.0,Amazing!!,"This was a really, REALLY good book--and a TRUE STORY.  Beware, though, the first 50 pages are SLOW.  Don't worry if you can't keep the characters straight.  You will keep the main ones straight shortly enough. Perservere the slow beginning, and the story is well, well worth it."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Candid and insightful reflections.,Tolstoy's honesty at his own selfish motives and his dissapointment with the true value of his accompleshments is wonderfully refreshing.   His writing is so personal and open that I don't think anyone can walk away from this unmoved.  I was dissapointed that he rejects the concept of a personal active God in the conclusion of his search
books,8 of 9,5.0,Must all literature be a mad rush to a formulaic conclusion,"Many readers of 'Waiting for Godot' obsess about the identity of Godot and whether he represents God or any other almighty being. It is unlikely that Beckett was referring to God as the man for whom the characters are waiting, as religion is only ever mockingly referred to in Beckett's theatre."
books,11 of 34,2.0,boring,"Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations"
books,1 of 3,5.0,Excellent overview,"For one who does not know the details of the history of Iraq, this book provides an excellent overview. Dr. Polk does a good job of explaining rather briefly the panorama of the people who evolved into today's Iraq. Everyone should read this book along with others about Iraq history. I look forward to reading the _How to Get Out of Iraq_ co-authored by Dr. Polk"

If you ever wanted to know the conservative (or classic liberal) point of view on the topics of the day (social security, welfare, minimum wage, etc.), but did not feel like trudging through ""The Wealth of Nations"", this is the book for you.  Whether you agree or disagree with the arguments, they are proposed in easily accessible language."

books,4 of 18,1.0,wretched writing,"An poorly written portrayal of life on Oahu involving a 17 year old gay, conflicted surfer and his neurotic, obsessive 16 year old hopeful friend (?), this book drags us into the terminally boring life of teenage Oahu.  Full of shallow character development, cliches, plus narrative and dialogue that is painful, this book deserves the bottom of the the gay adolescent book pile.  For those teenagers that resonate with this book and its characters, take a very hard look in the mirror.  If this is life, God, any God, help us all."

Sure he does it outside the guidelines, and with great vigor, but that's what makes him a rare treat. An enthralling story, with very satisfying thrills and outcomes."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Hilarious Childhood and Teenage Disasters,"This is one of the funniest books ever written. Jean Shepherd recounts his early years in a steelmill and oil refinery town in northern Indiana. The time is the late 1930's to 1940's. There is a sensible mother, a good-hearted father with an incredible vocabulary of cuss words, and a younger brother with an amazing ability to whine. We begin with the arrival next door of the Bumpus family, slovenly hillbillies with a million dogs that send our hero's father into explosions of outrage. We go through disaster after disaster until we reach the ultimate when our hero takes Wanda Hickey to the high school prom. I laughed so hard that I difficulty reading. Shepherd's mastery of description of small-town America in the 1940's is a pleasure to read, and it never stops being outrageously funny"

books,10 of 10,4.0,Good Cold Fun,"I enjoyed reading the Rifles quite a bit.  That being said, it was not quite up to par with the Ice Shirt.  The plight of the native people of Northern Canada (it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves) is not something one usually reads about.  While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the ""great white explorers"" and have little to do with those living there.   I enjoy how Vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters, leaving them to become real humans.  I will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment"

books,10 of 13,5.0,"Fascinating, useful, and well-written!","... This is a great history of social entrepreneurs, military leaders, and other great strategists who figured out how to get what they wanted.  Great short chapters on Joan of Arc, Patton, Alice Paul and the suffragists, Japan, and even Picasso and Matisse.  Turned out for me to be an excellent source of fun cocktail party chatter.  But it is a very very good and unusual kind of self-help book.  Yes, the book is NOT about military strategy, but is is about strategy in personal life.   I thought it was better than a ton of other popular history or self help books.  It helped me understand how to be more successful at figuring out how to get what I want.  On the cover General Wesley Clark calls this a ""very important book"" and I agree"

books,1 of 2,5.0,Great!,"Although fiction, this book, as well as others in this series, follows the predictions in the Bible.  It is a very feasible scenario of what is to come.  I greatly enjoyed reading the whole series.  I am an avid reader, reading up to eight hours a day.  When I start a good book I can rarely put it down before finishing it.  I certainly recommend this whole series to everyone, religious or not!  You just might learn something"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Pleasure to Read,"If you read for pleasure, then this book is for you.  A page turner in which you may ignore your favorite television show just so you may read the hysterical and brazen letters between the boy and his chosen recipient (the White House, a major league baseball player, etc). The book illustrates the development of father/son relationship between the boy and the baseball player. Charlie Banks, the Gentile baseball player, demonstrates true love for the boy by assisting him to prepare for his Bar Mitzvah.  While reading this book, one could envision a movie depicting this wonderful story"

books,1 of 2,4.0,All brides should read this book,"I wish this book had been available when I was 30 years younger as it might have helped me avoid some serious life errors. I would have even been happy if this book was available when my daughter married 8 years ago.  However, even though the gems of wisdom came too late for us, I recommend that all brides and wives read this book if they want to learn to improve their life, being supportive of their husband yet never giving up their right to be treated well.  Robin McGraw strikes just the right balance of compassion and determination.  It is instructional without being ""preachy"" - though best for Christians the wisdom could apply to women of any or no formal religious faith.  It would be a good idea for young grooms to read this too (to get an insiders view from the other side).  I bought the book because of the show on Dr. Phil about the book (okay I confess I wanted to read the ""dirt"" on Dr. Phil) but it was a delight in that you got the ""dirt"" but learned that the truth was given with a heaping helping of compassion.  I don't know if I would enjoy hanging out with Dr. Phil (he is intense) but I think I would love Robin.  She admits to what she did wrong and tells women how they can find their voice to make the best life possible for themselves and their families.  If your life isn't perfect (and I've yet to find anyone whose life is) then read the book, and if you agree pass it on to your sisters (biological or otherwise).  Here's to McGraw family values!!!"

books,,1.0,"Stick to Romance, Sparky.","Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does."
books,2 of 3,5.0,Fabulous read!,"If you're interested in campaigns and politics, this is a great book to pick up! Although it may seem thick, the pages somehow manage to fly by.

books,9 of 9,5.0,Suttree,"Absolutely exquisite. Perhaps that adjective gets overused nowadays, but here it is appropriate - perhaps even not strong enough of a term. ""Suttree"" is a must must must-read. It is such a profound indictment of the human race that it could be used as evidence against us if we are ever sued by space aliens. When viewed in terms of ""Blood Meridian"" and all of C McC's pre-Natl Book Award works, his range as an author is revealed and is humbling. The man is our greatest living novelist. I am grateful to him for having offered this work to the world."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Help....,Since my original language is German it was a great help to have this book now that my daughter is a student in an American school. Although I understand the basics of English grammar this book showed me steps on how to teach my daughter English grammar without making it too complicated. It also helped me refresh my grammar. I have also recommended this book to my daughters 1st Grade teacher as an ideal companion for any parent whose kids are starting to write stories of their own.
books,,5.0,The best Mccarthy novel to read first,"A lot has already been said about this novel, so I'll address my review to those unfamiliar with Mccarthy's work.  If you've never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start.  The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous.  If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling ""Blood Meridian."""

I have used this series to teach English as a second language and I have seen it start a non speaker"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Some True Grit Behind the Vapid Glitz,"Although far from Bukowski's best, this is a revealing send-up of what happens when brutal honesty (Buk) interacts with the California entertainment industry. A roman a clef about the making of the independent film Barfly based on Bukowski's life and some of his earlier stories,the book shows Bukowski finally gaining some recognition and acceptance near the end of his career. The movie stars Faye Dunnaway and Hollywood badboy Mickey Rourke who does a good job slurring and walking about with hemorrhoids. Yet it appears from the text that Bukowski would have preferred Sean Penn, who was originally cast in the part, to play him in the film--Penn had more heart. As always with Bukowski, there are real emotions, honest appraisals, and bone-cutting prose--not compromise, pandering, mediocrity, and unfortunately often successful attempts by MSG-dazed writers to pluck the heart strings and collect the cash.In all his books, Bukowski's presence is perhaps the most palpable of any author behind his fictional protagonist. This is, one might argue (and Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe did, in the Paradox of the Actor), the diametric opposite of actors, whose abilities lie in taking on the personae of others, and consequently losing their own identity in the process. The story is that when Bukowski, although much older, first encountered Arnold Schwazenegger in Hollywood, he had to be restrained from attempting to fight him just for being such an obvious phony. Far from his most testosterone-crazed, drunken bull self here,he does not seduce but does manage as if for old time's sake to pull onto his lap the pretty co-star during a wine-drenched film party. Even and especially when confronted with (and making some money off of) L.A.s billion-dollar dream machine, Bukowski (as alter ego Henry Chinaski) preserves his uncompromising heart and unwavering eye in the face of the ugly truth. A welcome tonic to Hollywood's treacle"
books,,4.0,"It's the Far Side, but...","Okay, it's a collection of Far Side comics, which is what I want, so it's awesome for that reason.  BUT, the actual final product in book form is a little disappointing.  First, all the comics are black and white.  Yeah, it's not about the art and you don't miss much without color, but come on, would a little color kill anyone (especially ones that were originally color)?  Second, it's pretty thin on strips, with 4 to a page most of the time (a good amount) sometimes 2 on a page, and even occassionally one comic on a single page!  It looks pretty silly with just one giant comic on a page."

books,1 of 2,2.0,what happened?,"This is one of the ONLY books by Nora Roberts I can actually say I didnt like. It was SO dissapointing I got mad everytime I looked at it. This books is about Oliva and Noah... THE END. That is practically what it is. It started off when they were both younger, them meeting when they were older and them meeting YET AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE. I guessed the story RIGHT from the beginning, and I hardly could ever do that before in any of Nora Robert's books. I hate to say it, but I DONT reccomend this book. It was really waste of time. What happened to the quality work of Ms. Roberts"
books,14 of 15,5.0,Inside Out,"This is the last weight-loss book you will ever need!  Thin Again teaches the reader how to deal with the inner causes of over-eating first.  I have never read anything like it!  It's not man-made psychological principles that will make permanent changes.  It's the application of Scripture and the healing ministry of the Holy Spirit.  Thin Again is a gentle, non-threatening, non-judgmental treatment of the problem of obesity and food-addiction.  I have read volumes on these subjects, but this one changed my life, and I am encouraged for my future as a much thinner person"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Romantic,"This book is magnificent. I found myself so encrossed in the story. I am just amazed at how Nora Roberts can make you feel. The romantic scenes with Margo and Josh were so powerful. The passion, desire and love between the two of them was so strong. You could only wish you had that type of love in a lifetime. Bravo Nora you are magnificent"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Great book,This book helps to keep your chin up.   Sometimes in sales it can be discouraging.   You can only take so many `no's.  This is a useful tool to help you get on top and stay there.    Ziglar is an incredible teacher.
books,3 of 4,4.0,Like discovering a long lost Bronte,"Based on 20 pages of an unfinished Charlotte Bronte manuscript, you forget that it was written in 2004 and are quickly enjoying what feels like a long lost Bronte! Ms. Boylan takes into consideration Charlotte's growing concern (at the time of her death) with children born into extreme poverty and deprivation. The plot involves a search for the true roots of an orphan (Emma) and introduces the readers as well as her main characters to London's back streets. Of course there are all the undying and unfulfilled loves as well as the unlikely coincidences that make for a great period novel"
books,3 of 5,5.0,Pretty Good Book!,"I enjoyed this book very much. I'm surprised that this one wasn't made into a TV-Movie (i.e. Once in a Lifetime, The Ring, No Greater Love, Fine Things), but I still liked it. Deanna was very realistic. She was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart, and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter, Pilar, who died as a result of a motorcycle accident. She met Ben Thompson and found fullfillment with him; Marc-Edouard was already having an affair with a woman named Chantal. I thought that he was a jerk for doing that to Deanna. But when it was all said and done and when I finished reading the book, Deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was Ben's. At last she could have a happy life with someone. Keep up the good work, Danielle!"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Like a guilty little trip to the corner Mickey D's,"Eric Schlosser's ""Fast Food Nation"" is a thorough if somewhat slanted analysis of the fast food industry.  The author hooks the reader early with sweeping invectives against the titans of fast food.  Before you can say ""Supersize Me,"" you've learned that Ray Kroc and his cronies are responsible for the homogenization of global culture, the spread of E. coli and other deadly pathogens, the obesity of America's children, and the exploitation of the unskilled masses.  Take a deep breath - that's just the intro."
books,1 of 2,4.0,Unflinchingly Honest,"I had mixed feelings about this book. I admire Brooke Shields for writing it. Yes, she has a lot of advantages most women who suffer PPD don't. But the feelings she describes are valid. She doesn't flinch from discussing thoughts of suicide or her visions of seeing her baby injured. These are shameful feelings for anyone and when you are in the public eye admitting you have had them is inviting an attack. I think it was a brave thing to do."
books,0 of 1,4.0,You try living on the edge of survival in an alien culture..,It's an engaging first-hand account from an anthropologist who went to live with an Inuit family.  She gives a very candid account of her own difficulties in adapting to their culture
books,19 of 19,5.0,Belongs on every low-carbers book shelf,"Once you've fallen off the low carb wagon, getting back on track can seem a daunting task. This book offers a sensible, gradual plan for easing back into the low carb life. It worked to get me successfully into a struggle-free induction when induction was always a major challenge before. The information about hidden carbs, artifical sweeteners, and other challenges low carbers face regularly is also a great asset. I've only tried a few of the included recipes so far, but they've all been very good."
books,1 of 1,2.0,round up the usual suspects,"Rollins' book is an unfortunate combination of the generic and the pretentious.  There's nothing wrong with a generic thriller, as other reviews have pointed out.  But if the author wishes to float a seemingly serious argument about evolution v intelligent design, it would behoove him to provide a moderately sturdy frame. The material from quantum physics does hark back to Jurassic Park, while the Nazi involvement moves us into the neighborhood of The Boys from Brazil or The Assassini.  Even the surprise ending - evident from about 200 pages away - is lifted straight from The Genesis Code by John Case.  But those conspiracy theory classics (well, Case's isn't a classic, but it's a good read) are anchored by well-developed characters and minimal dependency on the crutch of coincidence."
books,1 of 2,2.0,Boring but Good,"The information presented in this book is amazing.  The economics of baseball are hardly talked about.  There are some things that go on behind the scenes that most of us don't know about.  It was fascinating to find out about this, but it got to be too much for me to handle.  I ended up being bored with it in the end and that is why I gave it two stars.  I also disagree with some of Zimbalist's theories on how to reform baseball.  He is not open to any other ways, and I should know since I met him once for a seminar"
books,2 of 4,2.0,Terrible for the Teenagers,"as a 14 year old girl spending my entire summer reading this book was possibly the worst thing my teacher could have done to me. i can definately see how some older people could somehow get into it but its really just not that good in my perspective, to me the symbolism made no sense i didnt understand what they were saying most of the time and i'm an honor roll student with straight A's in english. i really deeply and truly do not suggest this book to anyone that is a teenager because it will bore you to death. it did me. pips character was too boring estella was too much of a brat miss havisham was too shrill, the ONLY good part of this book was herbert. he was the only one i liked. my mother loved this book and is now driving me insane with how much she is into it. yes, this book has given Dickens a bad name in my mind although he may not be a bad writer. i can usually somewhat get into english literature but this was just about all i could bear.in a nutshell...its definately a college read."

books,6 of 7,5.0,Splendid Catalog of Furturistic Technologies!,"As a process futurist, Joel Barker is a very familiar name.  His earlier book titled ""Paradigms,"" introduced the word paradigm to a wider audience in the business arena. I highly recommend that book to anyone intereted in understanding the nuances of paradigmic change in organizations."

books,0 of 1,5.0,LOVED it!,"I didn't read this book for the ""truth, or the lie"", but just TO READ IT! It was an amazing story, whether or not it's true was irrevelant in my eyes. James Frey is an amazing author. Putting all the ""drama"" aside about everything that went on, I really and truly enjoyed this book"

books,1 of 5,1.0,Elitist and Arrogant: :Part 2,"R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is "" ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex."" !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as ""... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman.""  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: ""Bigotry for me but not for thee."" BYTW, his earlier book, ""Lost Continent"" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff."
books,1 of 2,4.0,A delightful read,"La Capital tells an absorbing story by following the twists and turns of the history of Mexico City. The writing style is clear yet the author also gives a comprehensive history of the Mexican capital. Of special note are  the many anecdotes which provide much of the human interest for the reader.  My favourite was the story of Irma Serrena &quot;La Tigresa&quot;, a  presidential mistress"
books,1 of 9,1.0,I take some exception to the reviews....,"Well first off, I did not like the book nor the movie, both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art.     On the other hand, I take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here, as some sound very anti-american in their reviews.  We being good Americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not.   We do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the American experience for that.  If you do not understand this, TNEN BE QUIET ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND"
books,7 of 8,4.0,Leslie (Who liked the book) talks,"I thought this book was a very good book for kids of all ages. i'm sure you would agree with me. The book talked about everyone pacjing and getting all of thier things ready for the bid move and how Alexander was being  stubborn. This would be a good xmas present for someone planning on moving.  This book was long enough to get the message across, but not too long"
books,6 of 19,1.0,He Lacks Real Experience With Relationships!,"Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates ""escapes"" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it!"
books,8 of 8,5.0,Queen Without A Country,"Kings and queens of past times usually seem so remote, but Berengaria comes across as a genuine person that I felt I might have known. I could feel her joy and her trepidation, and sympathize with her heartbreaking rejections. The book convincingly portrays life in medieval France among those of high degree. &quot;Queen Without a Country&quot; held my interest from beginning to end"

Even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure, it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds I was embarrassing myself again."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Journey from the Land of No: A Girlhood Caught in Revolutionary Iran,"Roya Hakakian comes from a secular Jewish family who identifies with Iran. The family is integrated into Iranian life and Roya looks forward to the wonderful changes that will come with the Revolution. This is the story about the changes that came to the ordinary people of Iran. The dying of hope, the hopelessness of change. The story covers the lives of the Hakakian family, singled out for being Jewish, and the lives of the Moslem and Jewish families they know and who are their friends. This is not a happy story. It brings down to the indiviual level the failure of the Islamic Revolution in Iran."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Funniest Man Alive,"David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud & embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along. This one did not disappoint either.. FUNNY holidays tales that make the season brighter, or even out of season.. give you a healthy & hearty laugh."
books,9 of 43,1.0,Absurdity,"I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the ""extremely difficult themes"" and ""brilliant artistry"" of the play"
books,3 of 4,5.0,Underappreciated from the Land Down Under,"Shirley Hazzard is Australian by birth, but her extensive life experiences make her a wise world citizen.  After winning the USA National Book Critics' Award in 1980, this book should get more attention than it does. An amazing love triangle forms the plot, but it's the writing that takes my breath away, as well as the post WWII history on three different continents and the vividly drawn characters.  I'll admit I had trouble getting into it at first, but persistence paid off so that by the startling revelations at the end of the book, I was ready to start it again."
books,10 of 13,4.0,Society's integrity: finally someone has addressed it.,"It is about time that someone has had the courage to stand up and say what he believes about integrity in the world today.  Stephen Carter does a good job of posing questions that provoke thought upon a subject that is generally avoided because people like to fool themselves into thinking that they are living a life of integrity.  Carter points out how often, in everyday situations, people show that they have not sat down and contemplated their actions before they do something that could make them look bad later.  He shows have many people &quot;shoot first and ask questions later&quot;  rather than thinking about what is important enough to stand behind and what isn't.  A word of warning though, don't read this book unless you are prepared to look at your own life of &quot;integrity.&quot"
books,2 of 3,5.0,A blessing to read,"In this amazingly beautiful work of fiction, Robinson manages to capture the beauty, pathos, and miracles of everyday life. I walked away with two primary impressions: First, how absolutely breathtaking is the voice of Rev. John Ames.  For one squaring off against his own mortality, he has an amazingly refreshing outlook on life. Secondly, it has been a long while since I've seen quite a colorful character as Ames' grandfather: a kleptomaniac, one-eyed, vision-led prophet that fought against slavery with a Bible in one hand and a pistol in the other.  It is not a stretch to say that this book had echoes of Faulkner, Steinbeck, with as compelling a narrator as To Kill a Mockingbird."
books,2 of 6,1.0,Running with Scissors,"If you like strange stories, you will love ""Running with Scissors"" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone."
books,,5.0,"Excellent Read, Eye-Opening Vision","I found Banker to the Poor to be an excellent, enjoyable read that provided me invaluable insights into poverty in third world countries, and educated me about effective market-driven ways to allieviate poverty, empower the poor and transform poor women from victims to successful entrepreneurs.  Well worth anyone's time to read. The author's award of the Nobel Peace Prize seems very deserving."

If you are looking for a sales career or just want to reinforce what you already know, this wonderful CD is what its all about. In fact, it's a dream come ture for most.  This CD is a real look into what it takes to nurture a positive aditude about getting ahead and staying on top, not only in sales but in your life.  Thank you Zig Ziglar"
books,1 of 2,5.0,One of John Le Carre's Finest Novels,"No one has captured in evocative, mesmerizing prose the secret world of spies and diplomacy as brilliantly and as well as British author - and former spy himself - John Le Carre. In recent years he has turned his attention away from classic Cold War plots of espionage skullduggery for which he is best known in his ""George Smiley"" series of novels, to take on other, equally important, issues such as food and medical aid to developing countries. In ""The Constant Gardener"" Le Carre offers one of his most exciting novels to date, while posing some intriguing ethical questions for which there are no easy answers. These include whether the West has a moral obligation to give corrupt Third World governments substantial financial, medical and food assistance knowing that most of this aid will never reach those for which it is intended. He also raises the issue whether the Third World should serve the West as inexpensive sites for clinical trials of potential drugs which are harmful to patients who are unwilling participants in these trials, in the expectation that these drugs, once perfected, will be quite successful in curing the illnesses for which they are designed."

I would not have normally picked something like this to read for pleasure.  I found that this text is very attention grabbing, and it is extremly informational.  I would recommend this text to others"
books,2 of 3,4.0,Captain Nemo & The Nautilus,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like ""Vexed"" ""Zoophytes"" and ""Connoisseur."" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant ""Narwhal"" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure."
books,7 of 7,4.0,A Book Worth Saving For,"I first read this book in 1993. (I was out jogging one day and overheard two people discussing how it had changed their lives.I immediately bought it.) I especially like how it helps you to develop a healthy disregard for unsecured debt. Too often, we buy things on credit because we believe that we can't wait until we have the money. This book will help you to develop the proper mindset toward debt. With that essential foundation, you then address the problem of your specific debt. I especially appreciated his frequent reminder that you're not a bad person just because you owe money. I've recommended the book many times through the years"
books,5 of 5,5.0,Bard has redefined historical fiction!,"I am a huge fan of historical novels. Unfortunately I am often disappointed by writers who drone on and on about historical facts, and don't exhibit one ounce of creative talent. Rachel Bard's Queen Without A Country was captivating. I absolutely could not put it down until I read through the entire book in one sitting. For me, Bard has redefined historical fiction and I will forever use her book as a guide to judge the rest by"
books,,5.0,A Godsend!,"This book is a Godsend for folks trying to decide which is the right breed of dog for them.  Concise yet complete, and very readable.  You sit down intending to glance through your new book, and end up reading it cover-to-cover (often laughing out loud).  You now have a short list of possible breeds, and you know just what to do next, to find your dog.  Great book for dog-hunters"
books,13 of 15,5.0,Bringing Spirituality down to Reality,"As someone who has always appreciated and been intrigued by the different religions of the world and the similarities between them, I love how this book makes them all relevant to my life & how I live it.  One thing that most impresses me about this book is the author's thoroughness and conviction.  In The Power of Now, Tolle basically describes the essence of Being - what it is to be in the now, and what it isn't.  He successfully does this by addressing the major life forces that affect our ability to be present - the mind, the body, death, time, space, etc. - without straying from the heart of the book.  His knowledge, appreciation and respect for so many of the ancient spiritual teachings, from Jesus, the Bible, Zen, Buddhism, Taoism, and more, is enlightening in itself and supports his message very effectively.  Although I didn't agree with every concept in the book, I appreciate the thoughtfulness and compassion with which each is presented.  Tolle is a true spiritual teacher who has much to offer in the practice of self-discovery."

books,4 of 7,4.0,Good Review of History,"Avi Shlaim is in the school of what are called ""The New Historians"" on the Arab-Israeli conflict, along with Benny Morris who broke new ground in historical analysis with the Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem. This text by Shlaim is a great single volume overview of the history of the conflict, from 1948 and the war of independence leading all the way up to 1999. The thesis of his book is that the Zionist movement eventually adopted the political philosophy of Ze'ev Jabotinksy with his ideas on revisionist Zionism, his argument being that the Zionists must build up and Iron Wall in the Middle East to create the State of Israel, with the intention of allowing the Arabs in after they give up the fight. Essentially it's an ideology that breaks down as: the best defense is a good offense. And Shlaim makes a compelling case in his book, doing so as objectively as he can. He traces the origins of the first Arab war, the Suez War, the June 1967 war, the Yom Kippur war, and so on, leading up to the collision with the Palestinians and the still going occupation. The flaw in this text is that while Shlaim is able to draw on a wealth of primary Israeli sources (providing an excellent bibliography), he is unable to reveal Arab planning as he cites very few Arab sources. I don't pretend to know the truth about this conflict; there probably will not be an objective account on this for another 100 years for all I know. However, I think Shlaim is done an excellent job reviewing Israel's history and political policies in the Arab world, and anyone who is new to this topic should start here."
books,8 of 9,5.0,"""As one needs nothing oneself, why not live for others?"":  Olenin's epiphany","In the middle of _The Cossacks_, Dmitri Olenin, a young Russian cadet reflects joyfully, ""Happiness is to live for others. How clear it is!,"" while being mercilessly bitten by mosquitos during a deer hunt.  Despite the fact that his ""whole body [is] consumed by a consuming itch,"" Olenin revels in the beauties of bountiful nature.  It is almost as if he gives himself up to the mosquitos, whom he imagines are yelling out to each other, ""Over here, boys! Here's someone we can devour!""  Tolstoy develops the scene with such skill.  We see Olenin's joy quickly turn into confusion and mortal terror."
books,,4.0,A  journey you won't forget,"About a year ago I read ""Black House"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. I immediately knew I wanted to read ""The Talisman"", a book about the young Jack Sawyer and his early adventures in the Territories. However, there are always books I want to read and it took me until now to get to it. I must say that I did not find this book to be all that compelling in the beginning, but around the time Wolf made his appearance in the narrative I started getting hooked."

books,,2.0,A total disappointment and very depressing,"I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book."
books,1 of 2,5.0,For people who enjoyed being children,"A book that enables you to travel back in time...back to 1958, back to a time when there was Stan, Mike, Richie, Bev, Eddie, Ben and Big Bill and some others...back when some kids' main concern was avoiding Henry Bowers!"
books,7 of 7,5.0,Excellent C Tutorial,"After having unsuccessfully searched for the perfect C tutorials and also K&R C, I can confidently report that this is by far the best introductory text to the C language.  You can think of it as K&R in a truly tutorial mode.  Very complete coverage of language features and just the right amount of instructional aid without being too terse on the one hand (K&R) and without being to plodding and wordy on the other (Deitel and others).  You should find it as a thorough yet relatively quick read.  Kochan has a very nice writing style which makes the tutorial also very enjoyable and rewarding.  The example programs are short and sweet; very similar to the kinds of programs found in K&R.  There are also lots of appropriately challenging programming exercises at the end of each chapter and half the answers are available on the author's website (www.kochan-wood.com).  Another good feature is that the tutorial is arranged by subject matter so you can use it also as a user-friendly reference in addition to K&R"

books,0 of 1,5.0,A Fast Read,"Stuart Wood's Orchid Blues is a fast read ... his chapters are short, making you want to read on &amp; on.  Having only read one of Sutart's books (Orchid Blues), I am definitely going to read more of them.  You know there's violence; you know there's mystery; you know there's accuracy.  I read it so fast, I didn't even look at the back to see how it ended!  Now that's a good mystery!  And no swearing ... I am now going to read Blood Orchid.  And since Holly meets up with Stone, I will then go on to read the series of crime scenes he's involved in.  Thank you, Stuart Woods"

books,2 of 7,5.0,A must read for any Barfly fan.,"This novel by Charles Bukowski is basically the making of the movie Barfly.  All of the people are recognizable even if given not so obvious fictional names.  If you are a lover of Bukowski and a lover of Barfly the movie, this is a five star classic.  If you are a lover of either of the above----it's still a four star, well written work.  I found that this novel exceeds both Pulp and Women, his other known longer works, in both writing style and movement of plot and characters.  Theme wise it takes you to the familiar places that Bukowski often drags you to"

It's interesting to look back at at life 100 years ago and see how they used the little technology they had to fight off the enemy. This book is entertaining if you can put yourself in the era that it was written. It's not easy to understand, however. There is a lot of old English"

I don't know how anyone with a dog manages without this book
books,1 of 1,4.0,Haunting review of Hill House,"The story  ""Haunting of Hill House"" has great examples of people changing just to fit in.   Although the ""Haunting of Hill House"" fits this description perfectly with its eerie description of supernatural tales of the happenings of Hill House; there is more to it than hauntings.  The story starts out with three guests being invited to the house to monitor any out of the ordinary occurrences in Hill House.  Throughout the story the guests experience some ghostly moments.  However during this, one of the guest named Eleanor changes her ways to fit in with the guests. One example would be when Eleanor told lies about herself and her past, and when Eleanor went around the house alone having no fear.  Finally Eleanor became open and spoke out what was on her mind."
books,4 of 4,5.0,you always need to review the basics...,"If you're one of those ""Sure, I know how to cook...except I don't want to"" people, you need this book. This book gives you the basics on how long you can keep meat, how to pick good cuts, what to do with vegetables, and the essential hints on everything you need to get started. The best part of this book aren't the recipes, but rather the reference guides on the things you never quite know, like how to cook specific vegetables and how to build a soup or smoothie. Great for someone who has just moved into an apartment, or for anyone who wants to get a primer on cooking. If you are puzzled about what tools you need, fear not--it's all very simple, and there are many, many diagrams in case you freak out with too many words."

books,4 of 6,5.0,Fantastic revision of an already great book!,"I found Hargrove's book inspiring, insightful, and useful. I had read his first book - which was pivotal for me in creating my own coaching business-- and have found that he has taken this work to another level-a very compelling, as well as easy read. The two parts that I found most applicable to my own coaching clients were his step-by-step approach to coaching executives and the part on creating a ""laboratory"" that fosters collaboration within a group. I was able to bring these principles to a client who was wowed by what we were able to generate for her business. I would recommend this book to any coach, internal and external to a company, as well as to any leader who wants to create an ""impossible future."
books,,4.0,One of Clancy's best,"This is one of Tom Clancy's best Jack Ryan novels.  It is hard to put down once you get started.  The plot is intricate and interrelated without all the coincidences that mar some of Clancy's later novels.  He also has political points woven into the plot and action without the reader having to plod through page after page of pontification seen in some of his later novels.  (Even if you agree with Clancy's political views, it gets tedious in some of his books.)  The details of submarine theory, construction and warfare are interesting without getting in the way of the story.  If you have seen the movie based on this book, you will still want to read ""The Hunt for Red October"" as it is much more detailed and exciting.  As other reviewers have also mentioned, this book is much shorter than some of Clancy's more encyclopedic novels.  That makes for much crisper reading and less flipping back in the book to sort out who is who.  This was an exciting book when it was published, and even though times have changed it is still a good read"

Or as a gift to a young child whose parents you don't particularly like... This short story is, like all of Gorey, a wonderfully illustrated and twisted look at the world from a very different perspective. If you already like, or have an interest in Edward Gorey, I would recommend you skip this and just purchase Amphigorey which contains this story as well as many others"

books,13 of 14,5.0,One of the ten best books I've ever read,"I agree with Oceandweller who said he/she wished this book were still in print so he/she could send a copy to all his/her friends.  This book is terrific right from page one until the very end.  I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid.  Whatever I paid, it was worth it.  It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining.  Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends.  Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men.  ""With malice towards none and charity for all..."" these, his words, keep echoing in my mind.  Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation.  His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, ""When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion"". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to.  After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them).  This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Pure Story,The great thing about reading Gaiman's work has always been his commitment to story telling.  Whilst there undoubtably enough themes and issues in Stardust for even the most pompous literary critic to sink their teeth in to.  The main strength of this book (and indeed of most of Gaiman's work - excluding his literary collaboraitons) is its ability to fire you imagination.

books,1 of 5,2.0,"Great, perhaps, for English majors, but boring for my bookclub.","American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her"

The book flows nicely, is pleasing to the eye, and covers everything you could hope to learn about strolling gently down the path to inner peace.  I've been reading personal growth books since 1995 and this has become my new favorite.  I learned so much and have already put it into practice.  I'm sending a copy to my mother for her birthday and recommending it to all my busy friends.  Even if your life isn't busy, you can gain so much from this book.  Thanks, Joan!

books,2 of 2,4.0,Windy City,"Only one other city is so steaped in architecture history than Chicago and this guide does a commendable job of highlighting the most important Chicago buildings, the synopsis on each building is susinct, the only qualm I have is that there are not more pictures, I also wish the authors had ventured more into the suburbs and commented on some of the great houses in Lake Forest and Highland Park, but that omission does not mar the overall enjoyment of this scholarly guide.  If you are interested in architecture at all, I recommend you pick up this book, Chicago is so steaped in architecture history and this is a good guide to the best examples."
books,0 of 2,5.0,"""Well if it isn't Tom Sawyer""","A Painted House is a truely refreshing departure from the typical Grisham novel.  I do believe Twain would have been pleased.  Sp may parallels (not the least of which is the painting).  Not since The Client (another Grisham favorite) has there been such an engaging juvenile protagonist.  Like some reviews, I found it hard to imagine that Luke was a seven-year-old.  I think any other child that age would have a few more sleepless nights witnessing some of the events in the novel and keeping them secret as long as he does.  But the atmosphere painted by Grisham draws the reader right into the backwater Arkansas area in the hot, humid fields.  Humorous, touching, and above all riveting"

After giving his testimony in the first chapter, Zola devotes chapters to the Jews, Muslims, Palestinians, the government, media, education, churches, End Times and, finally, questions and answers.

The key one for me was, ""Who owns the problem?""  What a concept.  The premise is that rescuing my kids from the consequences of their actions is a lousy way to teach kids responsibility.   The section on grounding of kids was great too.  This book is making me question practically every aspect of my knee-jerk parenting responses.  Highly recommended"
books,4 of 4,5.0,An little known literary gem.,"I discovered and read &quot;Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; earlier this year.  And I cannot get it out of my head!  It's everything I ever wanted in a fantasy novel- ghosts, ghouls, occult philosophy, gypsies, romantic landscapes, murder &amp; mayhem, the Kabbalah and sex.  What more can a bibliophile want?  Treat yourself- get a copy as quickly as possible.  Though I prefer the Christine Donougher translation to Ian MacLean's.  She more successfully captures the surreal whimsy of the narrative that I feel was Potocki's intention"

books,,5.0,Great Foundation for the Novice Instructor,"I will concede Mr. Wolters critics that this book does emphasize firm discipline.  However I do not see this as a bad thing.  After all anyone who owns a dog, irregardless if they hunt, take it in public, or just keep it around the house wants a disciplined dog that they can control.  It does not teach excessive cruel punishment, just enough to let the dog know they were in the wrong.  It actually emphasizes lack of attention and apathy more for initial and minor corrections.  This book does counter the stern discipline by emphasizing the need to give affection after the rebuke.  When it is said that the book uses old ways and techniques, remember that this book was originally written in 1961.  But by no means is it outdated.  As far as training it provides a solid foundation of techniques and important commands.  What this book does not specify is timeframes on when to teach what.  This is because every dog is different.  It approaches the timeframe issue by applying the idea that when one thing is learned, move on to the next, but continue to reinforce all the previous trainings.  The important thing to consider when looking at this as well as any other book is that time is the critical factor.  Continuous daily training from an early age provides a system with which to grow.  This book establishes that framework.  With this system, you can train your dog to do anything."

books,2 of 2,1.0,title misleading,"there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was ""well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future"" it was too focused on that ...I liked ""Stranger In a Strange Land"" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page."
books,,2.0,Toxic psyachiatry is toxic for parents of the mentally ill,"I was going to assign this book to my students in my Abnormal Psychology class... The first chapter is powerful and true. However, this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children's illnesses!!!! He also attacks NAMI, the National Association of the Mentally Ill, an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover, find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life, and has truly educated more people about mental illness than Breggin has ever done himself, I am sure. The good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are, in my opinion, obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents -- attacks, I believe, that may be a result of his old-fashioned psychoanalytical training"
books,2 of 9,2.0,"Interesting story, difficult to read, see the movie?","I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new ""style"" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead"
books,5 of 6,5.0,A Masterpiece of Historical Writing,"Why should we take an interest in a war that happened four centuries before the birth of Christ? It is because this disastrous 27-year war between Athens and Sparta had a major impact on the development of the Western world. It finally ended in 404 B.C.E., and recent evidence suggests that Athens finally succumbed not to force of arms, but to typhoid. The result of the war was to put an end to hopes of Greek unification, and it was only a matter of time before the weakened Greek cities would fall victim to foreign conquest and lose the freedoms that were the vital essence of Greek civilization, and their greatest gift to the world. The triumph of Spartan oligarchy over Athenian democracy left a long shadow over the development of Western civilization."
books,7 of 8,2.0,Ok~ but I think the Keirsey Temperment Test is more accurate - and cheaper.,"This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology."

If you ever wanted to know what it is like to be a high-powered criminal attorney, this book will show you.  I am a civil attorney, myself, and this novel opened the door into the grimy other world of criminal law.  (Not that civil trial law is without its warts either.)"
books,,5.0,Pleasant and inoffensive reading for religious people,"This is a mildly entertaining and informative read. The book has been extremely controversial, mainly due to the title and the semi-divine status bestowed upon Richard Dawkins by the atheistic community. What is most interesting about the contents of this book (amply described in other reviews), is that Dawkins himself has almost nothing original to add to the science-religion debate. What are found in this book are re-hashed arguments that anyone with an interest in theology or philosophy will know well enough. How is it that someone like Dawkins comes to be known as one of the greatest thinkers of our time? I'm afraid that after reading The God Delusion I have no answer to this question."

As usual, Nevada fights the good fight, goes skinny dipping, gets her hair cut, and is finally free of her ex-husband (in a hilarious manner), while discovering the the secrets of Cumberland Island's murders"
books,0 of 15,1.0,this book sucks,"I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost"
books,9 of 9,4.0,Bay Area Psychedelic Poesie,"I have to admit to a great deal of personal bias here because I am a lifelong DeadHead.  So it stands to reason that my opinions towards Hunter  may be a bit coloured and clouded. (Pun possibly intended.)  But this is a  wonderful collection of lyrics.  Hunter is a true poet whose song lyrics  deserve to live and breathe in printed form.  I always felt there was a  poetry to rock lyrics: Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Jim Morrison, Richard Hell et  al.  Robert Hunter also deserves to be recognized on that list of Rock Poet  Laureates.  Beautiful lyrics like Box Of Rain and Ripple take on a new life  when read from the page.  It gives one the chance to see how good the use  of language actually was. Terrapin is a tour de force epic of Rock poetry  and almost everything from American Beauty and Workingmans Dead ring out as  great poetry.  While there is some average, weaker material as well, this  gives Hunter a chance to earn acknowledgment for the fine poet that he is.   The Grateful Dead would never have achieved their legendary status without  the mystical, magical lyric ability of Robert Hunter.  This book is a  treasure trove that deserves a place next to the Dylan lyric book from  62-85 and the collection of lyrics put out by Lou Reed as well"
books,18 of 24,1.0,scarier still is listening to Bill read this in his own voice,"I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst"
books,10 of 11,5.0,An intriguing installment to the Wind River series,"It is hard to believe that Margaret Coel began her Wind River Reservation series some ten years ago with THE EAGLE CATCHER, which introduced readers to Father John O'Malley and defense attorney Vicky Holden. Each subsequent novel has featured an intriguing mystery as well as a shift in the emotional but platonic relationship between O'Malley and Holden. The latest installment in this series is no exception."
books,3 of 4,5.0,"Golden Country is a ""must read""","Jennifer Gilmore's beautifully written novel transports the reader to early 20th century New York and beyond in this intricately woven story of three Jewish immigrant families. The reader is swept into this facinating, witty, descriptive and historical novel.  This is a must read.  Golden Country has a heartbeat, it's a real page turner"
books,17 of 17,5.0,A Must Read!,"Who is Tavis Smiley?  Initially Tavis' prominence in the media led me to think this guy was just a 'talking-head' - a person simply trying to find a means to move up in this world.  However, years have shown me I was wrong."
books,,2.0,Fast Fun Read,Not  a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read.
books,,4.0,"My first Grisham Book, and it was worth the Time","John Grisham has quite a reputation as being a very prolific author.  Being the best selling author the 90's means you've got quite a reputation.  So I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I picked up ""A Time to Kill.""  Needless to say it was a good book, but there are a few moments where it glares.  As it is Grisham's first book (and believe me, in some areas it shows), I'd expect a lack of substance.  Surprisingly, there's substance.  But there are times when the book really rambles on for a very long time."
books,2 of 15,5.0,Great Guide,"This is a great guide that I recommend to all of you who are looking for scholarships. Check this out thoroughly, and if you feel you're up to the total scholarship plus being paid for training that West Point offers, I recommend that you then go on to read ""West Point: Character Leadership Education..."" by Norman Thomas Remick to understand the importance of this college that is the best kept secret and the one that everyone has a good chance of getting into"
books,2 of 2,4.0,Knowledge as a Driver of Economic Growth,"This is a book that should be read by anyone interested in knowledge and its role in economic growth.  ""The Gifts of Athena: Historical Origins of the Knowledge Economy,"" is a sweeping and comprehensive account of the period from 1760 (in what Mokyr calls the ""Industrial Enlightenment"") through the Industrial Revolution beginning roughly in 1820 and then continuing through the end of the 19th century.  The book (and related expansions by Mokyr available as separate PDFs on the Internet) should be considered as the definitive reference on this topic to date.  The book contains 40 pages of references to all of the leading papers and writers on diverse technologies from mining to manufacturing to health and the household.  The scope of subject coverage, granted mostly focused on western Europe and America, is truly impressive."
books,5 of 5,5.0,The mother of all self-help books!!,"If you only buy one book about success this should be it! Zig Ziglar is a man of faith and positive vision. His philosophy is summarized in the idea that we are born to help others. Furthermore, by helping others we will be able to achieve our own goals. Zig writes in an anecdotal style that is delightful and easy to read. His writing will challenge you, make you laugh and shine the light of introspection upon your priorities. What is it you want to accomplish? Zig will show you the steps of procession that will guide you to the top and to your ultimate life goal. I could not more highly recommend this book"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Good but . . . .,Not to take anything away from my favorite author BUT I thought the book was way too long.  The story was suspenseful and descriptive but I found myself getting lost in the superfluous background. (And this is someone who has read The Stand at least six times so it's not the length of the book that bothered me as much as the length of the storyline.)  Stephen King fans will still enjoy the book but not as much as some others such as The Cell which I thought was great
books,1 of 1,5.0,Indispensable!,"I regard this book as an indispensable and practical tool for personal leadership development. Quite often, we get or give 360 feedback where a growth opportunity is evidenced. This book not only reviews each area of skills, but more importantly provides valuable examples that actually drive change"
books,,5.0,Changes your perspective on history,"I am a huge reader of history, and this is one of my favorites of all time.  While full of interesting facts and stories, it is set apart from most books by the depth of the analysis it provides.  It walks the line between history and social science, hinting at a theory of civilization and capitalism based on case studies from around the world.  Though professional it is not dry (though I am infamous for enjoying a good dry book).  My only criticism of it is the parts where it ventures into the cyclic theory of history.  This is a European (or French) historiographic technique of trying to edition long recurring cycles.  Frankly I find the concept forced (even more frankly, it's bunk!) and it always annoys me when I come across it...but it is part of the historical tradition Braudel was involved in, so it must simply be tolerated as a blemish on an otherwise stunning achievement"
books,3 of 6,5.0,Great Book,THis is an easy read and great instruction manual.  I've only read the first 2 chapters and I'm excited about reading the rest.  I hope to become a teacher who chages lives.
books,6 of 17,1.0,12-step &quot;logic&quot; taken to its logical extreme,"I read this book years ago...or, rather, tried to. I'm sure there are better examples of the truism, &quot;When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,&quot; but not many."
books,2 of 4,4.0,Man Thinketh,"The concepts are not new and hardly new-age. There are no new ideas in this book, Mr Allan was just the first to present them is all. James Allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book. He states in the book ""He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little. He who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly."" Effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book. James Allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure."
books,1 of 2,4.0,A great read,?Ponzi? chronicles the life of Charles Ponzi who is synonymous with the scam of paying off new investors with old investors money. This entertaining character would promise a 50% return on investment in 90 days.
books,11 of 20,2.0,Teaching good avoidance.,This book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then.  I personally can't avoid every 'unperfect' dog until then.  It goes over desentization (not rocket science) but doesn't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues.  I'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction' theory.  It's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it's puppy-ness or real aggression concerns
books,6 of 6,5.0,STILL APPLIES - FOR LARGE OR SMALL BUSINESSES,"A little bit on the dry side, but well worth it if you have the time. I read this one a while back and had to flip through it again to refresh my memory... and I'm glad I did. Consider this book to be the Consumer Reports/JD Power for companies back in the early 80's. It is still studied at some business schools."

If you are not a millionaire, then this book is not for you. I can give you better advice on how to get rich than Trump. I understand he knows more than i do, however, he does not share a damn thing with you in his book"
books,5 of 17,4.0,The dream is a search to find the trinity in objectivity.,"Berry is the first to clearly uncover the foundation.. the very fabric of the universe... as found in fundamental earthly reality.  This reality expressed as differentiated reality, subjective reality, and communion reality represents the essential trinity contained within all elements of the within and the without of all existence.  This foundation will enable us to move forward and grow our understanding of  unfolding cosmogenesis well beyond todays dreams. This triple reality though largely hidden will become like a modem and enable the unfolding transformation of inner trinity to emerge as conscious objectivity.  And it is interactions within and among differentiated, subjective, and communion realities which are at the heart of and in fact represent the incipient communion experience which each reality of the universe offers to every other reality in the universe."
books,7 of 10,5.0,Tactical Leadership for Business Mamagers,Through this book Charles M. Province has complied the very best there is in leadership. Read and learn....... This collection of George S. Patton's pithy one liners shows how business managers can successed by applying the  combat-tested principles of one of America's most famous battlefield  leaders. General Patton was a professional soldier who spent his life  inspiring people to accomplish the seemingly impossible. A brief bio &amp;  photos of the General help readers visualize one of the great military  leaders of all time. The inspirational content will make this book an  indispensable companion for busy executives everywhere
books,1 of 5,5.0,Frey touched my heart,"I have always wondered what happens in a Treatment center. How do people stop being an addict? What do they do all day? What kind of people are in a treatment center? This book answers those questions and shows that there's hope for every addict. I think it's an excellent read. A gift to all addicts.  It's exiting, I couldn't put it down and I thought about it quit a lot."
books,2 of 3,5.0,I LOVED this book!,"This book had me laughing out loud from start to finish. Jacobs is clever.  And he seems completely honest and unafraid to write candidly about the sorts of thoughts and feelings that everyone has but few admit.  Well okay, maybe not everyone; maybe just me and him. Anyway, I have trouble imagining any intelligent person not liking this book"
books,9 of 9,5.0,"Good Info, Great Recipes","When buying a book of this type, buy it for the value of the information instead of the person who wrote it.  Suzanne shares a method that worked for her, and she does it in a helpful, light-hearted, and humorous manner.  Even if you don't believe in food combining, the approach and the recipes are still quite helpful.  If you're serious about losing weight - and have tired everything else on the market - your success with this program will be 100% up to you and your determination to achieve your goals.  I think it's worth buying"
books,0 of 1,2.0,Not For Tourists?  Certainly not for the rest of us...,"This guide is honestly, pretty useless.  Any Tom, Dick or Harry knows about Wrigleyville, Boystown, and well, the rest of Lakeview.  Anyone can tell you that the heart of Lincoln Park is, well, Lincoln Avenue.  But, why, for the life of me, can't I find much on Bridgeport?  Mayor Daley liked it well enough, but, hey, The NFT guys can't be bothered with the facts.  Where's anything west of Western?  I guess Humboldt Park and Albany Park aren't worth the time.  Which is too bad, because it completely leaves out mention of some of the best bars and music clubs in the city, not to mention, some of the easiest to navigate streets.  If you're a tourist looking for lowest common denominator style travel books, then yes, I guess the NFT is a little better than average.  But when I saw how useless this thing was when a freshly moved in friend bought one, I knew that this is for tourists...and tourists only.  You're better off with the Irreverent Guide.  Heck, they might actually list an address for The Empty Bottle.."
books,4 of 6,4.0,Enjoyable Read,"I recently purchased a new copy of this book. I read it years ago, in 7th grade.  I enjoyed the book the second time and I'm glad I have it for my future children to read someday.  The story is a pretty heartwarming one.  Everyone gets along pretty well and there really isn't too much unhappiness in it.  Everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt.  This is mainly a story about learning to compromise.  I would recommend this book for children (primarily girls, since the main character is a girl) ages 10-13.  Younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them.  It's a nice story for adults too, for the child within.  It's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a ""dog"", and the unicorn as just a ""little white horse"".  I must say that I prefer the picture on the cover of the first book I read.  It was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn.  I think that one was much prettier than the current cover art."
books,,4.0,where's the head?,"The newest release in the Fear trilogy by Hooper, with the psychic FBI Special Force `unofficially' investigating a series of supposed black magic/Satanist rituals, until the agent, Riley Cane, awakens covered in blood and no memory of how she got where she is - for the past three weeks.  Even more disturbing, she can use her psychic abilities - something she's never had happen before.  Relying on her instincts she wades back in to the situation to find out what happened to her, and to the decapitated body found in the nearby woods - in an apparent Satanic ritual.  While Riley doesn't know who to trust, she treads carefully through the clues and crime scenes to find out what happened. I was frustrated with unanswered questions, though, after I finished reading"
books,7 of 7,5.0,I Wish He Was Still Around,"This had to be one of the most enjoyable books I've read in years.  It's actually based on Bukowski's life and the events that lead up to and involve the making of his movie &quot;Barfly.&quot;  It's totally off the wall, but Bukowski's take on Hollywood's own particular brand of insanity is probably just as true today as it was when Charles Bukowski penned this masterpiece of the absurd.  Definitely a great book from one of my favorite writers.  Highly recommended"
books,7 of 7,4.0,Keep the Dream of Freedom Alive,"Mayer's missive about miscarriage of justice in Ada, OKlahoma, has been re-released to coincide with best-selling legal thriller author (and attorney) John Grisham's first foray into non-fiction True Crime, *The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town.* Although chronicling different crimes and different cases, they occur on common ground. Both constitute a grippingly nauseating expose of Ada, America, run totally amuck. (Be afraid.  Be very afraid that this can and IS happening right here, in the ""Land of the Free"")  In the Afterward to this update, (no pictures :-(   Mayer aptly describes the obscenity of District Attorney Bill Peterson (WHAT?!? He's still there, in his absolute power?!? Proving what they say about absolute power - it corrupts absolutely) and his band of Good Old Boys as ""Kafka in Oklahoma."""

books,9 of 9,5.0,Get to know the people of the expedition,"Though this book explains what happened to the members of the expedition after they came back, it is more than that. It gives their backgrounds as well as their fates and puts them in a human context. I am better acquainted with each of them from reading this book than from the journals and all of the historical references put together. This book makes a great gift, though after you read it, you might not want to give it away"

books,,5.0,Pure Beauty,"Hunter's words, the inspiration, soul, and backbone of the Grateful's Dead's songs, are here collected in all their subtle grace.  His songs read like poems, and his poems burst like songs.  Vital reading for dead-heads and poetry lovers alike"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Well written - highly interactive for all ages,"Great Book...well written, easy to follow exercises!  Lisa Bany-Winters has written a highly comprehensive and interactive book packed full of theater exercises with great tips for additions to each exercise.  This book is terrific for elementary school teachers, camp activity leaders, children's parties and of course, children's drama instructors.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows a wanna-be star"
books,22 of 36,2.0,"Some helpful information, but this book is NOT for everyone!","Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive."
books,3 of 4,5.0,Great corrective to what's out there,"While I wouldn't recommend that my students read only Paul Johnson's work on US History, I would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts.  Johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the American people/government than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today.  He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears."
books,8 of 8,5.0,Excellent Vegan Offering,"Vegan recipes should be all about health and freshness--but this doesn't mean that vegan food can't taste incredible as well.  Far from it.  Donna Klein proves as much with this wonderful cookbook, which is full of interesting recipes AND beautiful photographs.  It'd be a great book even if you were just going to use it as a coffee table curio.  However, you should definitely check out the underground cookbook phenomenon Cooking com Bigode if you're into this sort of vegan food...go to somethingconstructive.net/jamanta and see what sorts of vegan recipes you WON'T find in Klein's wonderful, but mainstream, Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen."
books,3 of 5,5.0,Very usable education,"Great book of Wisdom. Most importantly USABLE. Well written, no details left out on EXACTLY HOW to do each step.You can tell Thomas has ""been there, done that"". Unimagineable amount of professional resources that comes with the book"

books,1 of 3,5.0,Very Happy Hours,"This is hands-down the BEST ""mommy"" book I have read.  Forget all the parenting magazines, forget all the girlfriend guides...anyone who has become a mommy and wonders where the wild girl she was before went MUST read this book.

books,3 of 4,5.0,Two legends restored to life,"The praise given Dave Kindred's book ""Sound and Fury: Two Powerful Lives, One Fateful Friendship"" on its back cover doesn't even begin to do it justice. This ""tri-biography"" of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cosell, and the partnership between the two, is a wonderful book and a novel concept that only a few had the knowledge, connections and talent to write. Thankfully for all of us, Kindred has."
books,4 of 4,5.0,The New Classic,"There are millions of books out there offering to seduce you or browbeat you toward a particular belief system, but for the thoughtful philosophers, the nervous doubters, the nonbelievers (both lost and  found), and evangelical athiests, there are very few well-written, even-handed, inspiring texts.  Jennifer Hecht deserves a wreath of laurels for creating an exciting, readable, joyous work that belongs in the home of every open-minded, rational, seeker of enlightenment. This book should have its own section in bookstores."

She is a masterful storyteller, with the ability to pull you into a time and place, and an extraordinary family situation. Plain Truth tells the story of an Amish girl by the name of Katie Fisher and the lawyer, Ellie Hathaway, who defends her in a murder trial. Katie is accused of neonaticide, killing a baby she refuses to admit she delivered even though it is a medically indisputable fact that she has just given birth."

However the orphans finally make some friends at the school and for a time it seems as though this school will be better than the other places they have lived.  However, Count Olaf, in disguise, gets hired as the school's new gym teacher.  Once again, Olaf finds a way to sneak past the people in charge and trap the Baudelaire's in another trap."

books,2 of 3,4.0,Much better then the first...,"Well, after reading Born In Fire I didn't have much hope for Born In Ice but it was so much better then the first.  These are the first Nora Roberts books that I've ever read.  This is the 2nd book of 3 in the ""Born In..."" series & I really enjoyed it.  In the first book you were introduced to Brianna & this book is her story.  She is running her bed & breakfast in Ireland when a writer from America comes to stay at her inn.  He is there for several months while writing a book.  During his stay him & Brianna begin a romance that neither of them expect to continue once his book is completed.  This was a very peaceful & enjoyable read.  I recommend this book in the series."

books,4 of 4,5.0,"""If Alive, Please Help.   If Not, Wrong Number.""","I didn't discover the delight that is the Artemis Fowl series until a week ago, when I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one day.  So, of course, I had to pick up a copy of THE ARCTIC INCIDENT right away, to see if it was as good as the first.  It definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, I think I liked it even better than the first book.  There are points throughout the book where Artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable side that I truly enjoyed.  Don't get me wrong, he's still an evil genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help but love him."

books,1 of 4,2.0,overrated for sure,"This book could have been ONE chapter, but I guess that's hard to sell! I have no idea why this has such a high rating. It's repetitive, internally inconsistent, and so vague as to basically be a bunch of handwaving. If you want a hopelessly out-of-date book about a CEO patting himself on the back, go for it. Bonus- tons of boring anecdotes! (Gotta fill up the pages somehow!"
books,20 of 24,5.0,Well worth the read!,"Geoffrey Moore's latest book should be required reading for all executives in the age of the Internet. Rather than filling out a theoretically weak book with numerous examples, or building a detailed theory which cannot be  applied, Moore has produced a brilliant work of practical business theory.  Drawing on and extending his work in Crossing the Chasm, Inside the  Tornado, and The Gorilla Game, Moore looks at various stages in the  development of businesses, how to manage for shareholder value, how to  create and sustain competitive advantage, and how companies with diverse  cultures can effectively overcome the innovator's dilemma. Any executive  feeling threatened by the Internet, or wishing to take full advantage of  discontinuous innovations, should read this book"

I used to think the players were a bunch of greedheads...once you know the history of the relations between owners and players, though, it's easy to understand where they're coming from"

A beautiful story of a father/son just trying to make it in America, and a story of true friendship & love."
books,2 of 3,5.0,A very nice fascimile,"I really like this Bible.  In fact, it is probably my favourite version of the few copies in my personal library.  It is an exact fascimile of the 1611 Bible with proper typeface, spellings, etc.  While reading it, one can easily imagine him/herself in 1611."
books,7 of 7,5.0,What an Inspiration!,Jeanne Torrence Hauer really put together quite an inspirational book.  Each of her sixteen subjects were unique in their own experiences.  She presents them in such a way that I did not want to put the book down.  This is a must read for anyone who is looking to change the path their life is taking or would just like to be entertained by the successes of others.  This book would make a good gift
books,2 of 2,4.0,A History of the American People,"I am an unabashed  admirer of Howard Zinn, but I am tremendously impressed with Paul Johnson's A History of the American People. I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Beautiful Sequel,"This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables.  It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college.  Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad.  It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first).  Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change).  For anyone who liked the first book, this is sure to not disappoint"
books,11 of 11,2.0,Little more than a collection of anecdotes,"Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new ""web 2.0"" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir"
books,8 of 8,5.0,What Are You Thinking This New Day?,"Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""A man is what he thinks about all day long..."" We are...we really, really are. But the sad fact of the matter is, most of us do not really know what we are thinking. In fact, I would say that most of us aren't really thinking at all. Most of us are just operating on unconscious reactions to things."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Reads like a novel and a terrific work.,"This book discusses the last hundred years of the Western Roman empire to its fall. Having read many of the reviewers here, I don't think its worth while repeating the writer arguements so I will report my thoughts."
books,2 of 3,5.0,How To Get Out of What Your  Parents Wanted (for You),"A second career attorney, I was looking to transition out of law and back into a pre-law interest.  Needless to say, despite my skills, talent, and having been around the block several times, I guess I must have slept through Interviewing 101.  Vicky's book and semininar enabled me to hone in on producing a better resume, turn supposed ""quirks & weaknesses"" into strengths, answer difficult interview questions, and basically, duh, remember who I was.  She helped me nail the job, and frankly, I haven't been so happy in ages."

books,,4.0,Chick Lit -- Cross between Devil Loves Prada/Nanny Diary & more,"If you haven't read this book-- it's a must-- it's a classic early version of Chick Flick. This is an outrageously funny book and yet sincere in it's look at the inside view of a gal with a few extra lbs and being single in the 90's. Still a national best seller. It is so much fun for anyone who tries to lose weight or is on a diet (isn't that all of us) in the course of the book she loses 72 lbs and gains 74 -- hilarious or is it? A droll sense of humor, a strong emphasis on how we look and how we relate to men-- will give any female reader much to think about and chuckle about too. Do you want to lose 7 lbs, stop smoking and develop inner poise-- well see how Bridget does or doesn't do all of that in Bridget Jones diary.Fast summer read-- great airplane reading, fun reading for a mom who has to read in short breaks between kids, food, family and chaos! Good re-reading too....keep it at the summer house for guest"
books,4 of 8,1.0,e-book is a mess,I bought and downloaded the eBook of this famous book for my research.
books,7 of 7,5.0,Entertaining and Informative.,"I found this book to be extremely entertaining, as well it offered little hints on how to operate more effectively in the concrete jungle of modern society.  Some might view this book as some sort of evil manual on how to manipulate or control people, and they are right to a certain extent if that is how you choose to view this book.  On the other hand you can look at it as a book that can help you prepare for the inevitable challenges which you are going to be faced with, that is how I choose to view it.  In my opinion this book is like chemistry.  Knowledge of chemistry can be used to make bombs and other horrible things or it can be used to help create many wonderful things which are too numerous to list here.  In the end it really depends what you do with this knowledge.  To sum it up I enjoyed this book and thought it was worth my time to purchase and read"

books,3 of 6,1.0,Save your money and go practice the Golden Rule,"This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Outstanding,This book is FANTASTIC!!  I bought it for my grandkids and kept it for myself
books,3 of 4,5.0,Up with the best for returned veteran stories,"When I first started this book, I had to put it down for a few days and read something else. The rambling ""device"" at first put me off as annoying. I warmed to the unusual style, however, on the second try and was amply rewarded. As a Vietnam veteran I can be easily offend with the ""loser"" image of a returned veteran. But this is misleading. Paco is severely wounded and simply wants to work hard (most likely a penitent) and be left alone. He finds his safe harbor in Ernest, the owner of the Texas Lunch diner, where he washes dishes (washing away his sins, yes yes I get it). Ernest's ramblings about combat on Iwo and Guadalcanal add a great coda and understanding. Heinemann really brings these characters to life, especially the talk about combat and how they feel. The most intriguing character is Jesse, another vagabond Viet vet who stops for dinner. As I am also a former paratrooper, Jesse's rantings and observations are priceless. Pay attention to what Jesse says about the ""proposed"" Vietnam Memorial. Understand Scruggs's idea came about in March 1979, with Heinemann publishing excerpts of this book starting in 1979 (winning the Book Award in 1987). But Cathy gives us a view of how others see us, no matter how unfair that may be. Cathy at first sees Paco as ""cute"" then ""ugly"" as she observes him night after night with his nightmares. What Paco reads in Cathy's diary is what many civilians felt about us deep down and their refusal to help in reintegration. One final unrelated note: one reviewer of this book may be unaware that Caputo served in Vietnam, whereas Clancy never served in the military. Heinemann is the real deal, with characters very real to me and my experiences"

books,,5.0,True side of human nature,"Dickens explores various sides of human nature in Great Expectations, as he tells the story of Pip, a common, lower-class, laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman. Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides. The book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur, how quickly man can turn on his closest friend."
books,4 of 6,5.0,A Manual for Trading,"This is an excellent text, which will allow you to become a decent beginning trader. Carter discusses psychology, computers, trading platforms, quote software, market sentiment indicators, and gives you 8 trading setups. A brilliant book"
books,3 of 6,5.0,AKC,"Excellent book. You can find most of this information on their web site, but it's great to take to a dog show when you have questions about other breeds. Wonderful book. I always reference it"
books,8 of 8,5.0,Very insightful,"In response to other reviewers, yes, this book does rely heavily on stereotypes of male and female behavior.  If you find you don't fit the stereotypes (and of course not everyone does!), then you'll need to look for another book.  But for many (most?) of us, the insights and advice in this book will be very helpful.  As I read, I was constantly amazed by how much I could see myself and my husband in John Gray's descriptions.  Last night I had my first opportunity to try out his techniques on how to prepare a man to listen...and it worked beautifully!  A situation that would certainly have escalated into a hurtful argument was diffused into a calm, brief conversation that left both of us feeling warm and loving toward each other."
books,12 of 13,5.0,An epic and personal journey of a theatrical giant,"This book is perhaps one of the greatest autobiographies of the modern Theatre. Kazan pulls no punches in depicting his epic journey from Greek immigrant to one of the greatest theatre and film directors of all time.  His life parallels the crucial artistic movements and conflicts of the  Twentieth Century: The Group Theatre, The HUAC hearings, The height and  fall of the Hollywood Studio System, the founding of the Actor's Studio,  and the development of the American Theatre. Kazan, along with Arthur  Miller and Tennessee Williams played a crucial role in creating a strong  and vibrant American Theatre. All throughout this amazing journey are  insights into the craft of acting as well as the trials and tribulations of  a man struggling for personal identity. This book demands to be on the  shelf of any student, practitioner or fan of the Theatre. Five out of five  star"
books,1 of 7,1.0,Very little appeal,"This book was a gift and that is the only reason i am not returning it.  The story is bizarre, which in and of itself is not bad but this is...bad.  Luckily my daughter found it as painful as i did to read.  Zero appeal on any level.  If you want great bizarre try ""Heedly pecked me in the eye""!"

The book is written in a simple fluent language and brings out the point very clearly. It will take me to the next level of programming."

Now we have them in an interesting, easy-to-read and-make recipe roundup.  My copy ofJean Anderson's cookbook is tabberd with post-its to preprare  favorite recipes soon--especially Shrimp de Johnghe (page 120) and  StroganoffCasserole (page 151).

books,1 of 1,5.0,"Tedious, Voluminous, Intense","Having chewed and digested ""Around the World in Eighty Days"", ""Five Weeks in a Balloon"" and ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked ""true"" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, ""20,000 Leagues"" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right."

Her character development in this book (as well as all of her other books) is excellent - I feel like the main character is a good friend of mine becasue I know her so well. I HIGHLY recommend this book

books,3 of 5,5.0,How to identify trends and create ventures to capitalize,"Copying success is a waste of time, is the provocative observation of entrepreneur Gary Hoover. Instead, entrepreneurs and business managers need to develop our own, original views of the world. This mind-set requires curiosity, the study of history and geography, and the formation of their own unique vision. Hoover's Vision: Original Thinking For Business Success aptly describes how to employ those elements to identify trends and create commercial ventures to capitalize on them"
books,,5.0,Maximum Fun,"As an adult, I picked this book up for my daughter and began looking over it in the car.  Before I knew it I had read the whole thing and wanted to read the first book in the series.  My daughter and I both really liked it, sci-fi, adventure, and a little romance thrown in just for fun"
books,2 of 2,5.0,I (heart) Wigfield!!!,"I guess I'm in the minority of Talent Family/Strangers with Candy fans who LOVED this book.  It was so over-the-top and ridiculous, but that's what makes it great.  Like another reviewer said, the pictures alone make it worth the price of admission.  I checked this one out of the library, but wouldn't mind owning it, to go back and re-read my favorite passages and crack up over the insane pictures."
books,2 of 4,5.0,don't own a pet without this book!,"This is a great book to have if you own a cat or dog! I've used it more than I ever thought I would. From destructive behavior to depression to obesity this book covers ALOT of issues pets suffer from and can be helped by their human gaurdians. I volunteer at an animal shelter and I see everyday how quick people give up on their pets. before you make that decision- get this book and give your pet the time,patients,and the second chance they deserve!!"
books,12 of 13,5.0,I made miracles happen using this book,"This book as well as the other Geurrilla marketing books by Levinson adjusted my entire concept of thinking as a businessman and I made miracle happen as a result.  Levinson really sifts out a lot of nonsense of  marketing tactics, and gives you one atomic weapon after another to really  launch an effective attack on the marketplace and hold a position.  It was  a book of continuous eureka's for me as I read.  I suggest keeping a  notepad handy as you read because your bright ideas will begin to explode  one after the other and you will want to record them for later use.  This  book is entirely loaded with data.  I recommend it for everyone with a  desire to be successful in business"
books,3 of 4,5.0,An excellent approach to designing a company,"I think the authors provide a powerful and empirical approach to designing and analyzing a service organization for success. The recommendations are not always intuitive nor easy to implement, but, based on my experience in  several industries, I think they are nearly always correct. With a partner,  I am starting a own company and have read this book twice very carefully,  with lots of notes in the margins, to make sure we do the important things  well"
books,6 of 6,4.0,Irving Penn: A Career in Photography,"Irving Penn: A Career in Photography is a book that examines the work and life of photographer Irving Penn. Several different writers and people associated with Penn have included text to describe their view of Penn and his life in photography. Colin Westerbeck, Issey Miyake, Martin Harrison, Edmund Carpenter, Rosamond Bernier, Colin Eisler, and Jennifer Jankauskas all contribute to the book. Writer and editor Colin Westerbeck invites the reader into the history of Irving Penn through a summary of Penn's life in his photo career. He begins with Penn's early fashion feature called ""Flying Down to Lima"" where after a case of airsickness, developed a new vision that changed his view of photography. Westerbeck also mentions Penn's different styles and renowned photo shoots including his many photos of various celebrities wedged into a narrow-angle corner he created out of theater flats, and also Penn's move to platinum prints. The remainder of the 200-page book comprises Penn's more famous photos. In total, there are 193 in the book, some which correspond to the text."
books,9 of 13,5.0,Unusual journey  of an ex-Leftist intellectual  in New York,This highly readable book is going to be despised on the far left for exposing some of the key intellectual icons/godparents of the movement as insidious buffoons.

books,3 of 4,5.0,An Eye Opener,"This is probably the best book I have seen that tackles the theory behind how groups or corporations grow and change over time.

Although appearing to be common-sensical in it's folksy mid-western prose, ""Essays"" explains in succinct and clear detail Buffet's fundamental analysis of businesses. Among these are a strict adherence to full disclosure of accounting transactions, the concept of economic goodwill, and confidence in conservative, factually confident and integrity filled management decisions. A solid, yet gap-filled introduction to Buffet's value-based investing principles"
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Wonderful Train Wreck,"Having read several of Ford's other novels previously, I pretty much got what I had expected and had hoped for.  No need for outrageous plot twists, chase scenes, or bawdry dialogues.  The disintegration of this family showed me that people never stop growing, learning, and succumbing to not what is expected but what feels right at a particular point in one's life"
books,,5.0,Great Adventure Story!,"I'm an avid reader of real life adventure stories, especially ones that bring out survival instincts in the face of tragedy and deprival. This is one of the best true stories I have ever read. Dean King brings to life the historical background of the shipping industry in the early 1800s, the adventures of world trade by sea, and most of all brutal slavery and daily raw survival in the Sahara desert. Every imaginable horror occurs to the shiprecked crew and yet many of them make there way to eventual safety. Incredible"
books,1 of 2,2.0,Love Stirling's Other Books--This One is a Dud,"I loved Stirling's ""Islands in the Sea of Time"" trilogy, and I also loved the first book in this series.  Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing"

Its main thesis seems to be that the FAFTA agreements were basically a fraud perpetrated upon the American worker by a global elite.

This book, while an interesting and easy read, is not fun.  I can't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it....he hasn't really publicly commented on it, other than to say the author had his full support.  I don't know--it just seemed a weird portrait of someone...it seemed over-dramatic and Vanity Fair article-esque.  Or like Confessions of a Shopaholic.  Ew.  I don't know what MNS is really like or if Bamberger interpreted things accurately.  I just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently."

It was so well written it made me feel like I were diving and hunting treasures myself!  And it has such a sweet, romantic storyline.  I was really sorry to see it end.  I hope there will be a sequel.  I recommend any woman to read this book, whether you like romance novels or not"
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Mutual Fund Manual for Every Investor's Bookshelf,"We believe that this classic work by one of the twentieth century's great investment authorities belongs on every investor's bookshelf. Published in 1999, at the height of a notorious stock market bubble, it was a rare, sage, clear-eyed appraisal of investment reality. It remains relevant. Author John C. Bogle argues so strenuously for a low-cost, passive investment approach based on index funds that you could almost accuse him of marketing hype. After all, he did start Vanguard, an investment company best known for its low-cost index funds. However, the evidence he presents to back up everything he says exonerates him fully. Today's investors are not quite as eager as investors were in the 1990s to believe in the impossible dream of infinite wealth from the stock market. Still, many people waste their time and money trying to beat a market that the best financial research unequivocally shows is, for most people and over the long run, unbeatable. Bogle explains why, while recommending much-needed reform of the mutual fund industry."

The story was definitely more emotional than it has been in the past, which really took it to a whole new level.  I can't wait for Act of Treason to hit the shelves.  Flynn's writing is leaps and bounds better than his first couple of books.  He has really come into his own as a writer.  5 stars here is a no brainer"
books,6 of 6,4.0,A mixed review...,"This is an important book about why societies, ancient and modern, collapse.  Given Professor Diamond's background in the environmental movement, it's no surprise that he sees the reasons as ultimately environmental.  That is, people in a culture have to choose how they will respond to their environment, and it they choose poorly, they may pay with their lives-- and the lives of everyone else."

A recollection of the life she led in Long Island N.Y. and the journey she made with the Brooklyn Dodgers. It is not just about baseball, it's about growing up in the late forties and fifties, about family life, a coming of age story for Doris and ""Dem Bums"".This past summer  was the 50th anniversery of the Dodgers first world championship in 1955 and it seemed an appropriate time to read Ms. Goodwin's memoir and I'm so very happy I did."
books,3 of 8,2.0,dangerous,"the author insists, so far as I can tell, that the only way to write a decent novel is based on some Aristotelean idea of the 'premise' which cannot be violated.  'Love leads to death' is an example for a character who dies as a result of being in love.  This is nothing but an obscene simplification of the plot.  It's absurdly reductionist."

books,6 of 6,4.0,Thought Provoking But Could be Written Better,"This is an interesting book devoted to the importance of knowledge in the formation of modern industrial economies.  Mokyr has several goals.  The first and most important is to illuminate the origins of the modern industrial economy.  Others are to illustrate the impact of modern economy, particularly its knowledge based elements, on modern life, to discuss barriers to the acquisition and dissemination of knew and useful knowledge, and to discuss differences in economic behavior between firms and households.  The quality of the book is somewhat uneven, possibly because this book is based on prior essays and lectures that Mokyr has prepared in the last decade.  While the book certainly has a strong theme, the individual chapters don't allows cohere."

The case studies are very detailed and give uninformed readers like me an understanding of how other people have created successful social programs that benefitted their society.  If that is what you are looking for, I highly recommend this book"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Absurd and frightening - one of the best novels ever written,Kurt Vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels.  Two of them are truly great.  Cat's Cradle is one. (Slaughterhouse Five is the other)
books,1 of 1,4.0,The Tragicomedy,"Waiting for Godot was dubbed a ""tragicomedy"" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play.  The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work.  However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you.  Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be.  Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own.  What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality.  Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous.  Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale.  Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold.  A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor"
books,7 of 9,4.0,A useful text,I assigned this text almost unseen as a course book because it included so many of the classic essays which one might have ended up xeroxing.  The students found the book very useful. I would have liked a more historical  focus but that's because of my own training. I will assign the book again

books,0 of 1,4.0,Excellent book! (but.....),"It has intrigue, suspense, love, betrayal, and twists on every hand, everything that makes a good book great; starting with a princess coming home accompanied by her entourage, welcomed by a king and HIS entourage, and the welcome home party that soon ensued. I absolutely could not put it down. The only drawback was the lifestyle of some of the players and their unnatural affections toward others. This played a minor role, however, and although it made me a bit squeamish to read, it was quickly passed over and the story progressed. Thus the less than perfect rating."

But the book turned out to be so much more than advertised, I think its title must be wrong.  It should have been called, ""How to Use AJAX Methods with PHP, MySQL, DOM, CSS, SVG, XSL, XML, RSS, and JavaScript Frameworks.""  I certainly never expected to read it cover to cover, but that's what I did."

I thought I would read this book to continue my study in persuasion just to make me a better marketer, that I was in fact immune against most persuasion. Not so, says the author. His opening chapter about the illusion of invulnerability, shook me. It made me realize I'm just as easily swayed by ads and marketing as the next person. And so are you. This book is a great warning, a powerful education, and a great research tool. I'll use it to improve the marketing I create, but I'll also remember it the next time someone trys to market anything to me. Great book. Get it. Read it. Use it. - Joe Vitale, author of way too many books to list here ..."

See, Nick and I drank together back in the day. The book is mostly how it all happened. They left me out because I wanted big money ($25).

books,1 of 1,5.0,Book published in 1921; Good but difficult and different.,"I read this 1921 book because H.L. Mencken, my guide when it comes to literature, thought so highly of it. It is perhaps most difficult to read because it is a fable and fables of course, do not consist of characters and actions which are based in reality. The book is a little hard to follow at the beginning. It is rather hard to explain what the story is about."

books,3 of 3,5.0,A fascinating glimpse into the American psyche,"Richard Huber's book should be required reading for anybody who wants to know what makes Americans tick, and the values they embrace on the road to success. In a fascinating historical narrative, he shows how capitalism and  spiritual values have been intertwined since before the revolution. Today's  bestseller lists are topheavy with writers who promise a spiritual path to  financial riches, but Huber's great contribution is to show how old an idea  this really is in America, and his research is extraordinary. In some  cases, the same language describing &quot;positive thinking&quot; today can  be found in historical tracts over 100 years old. All in all, a worthy  contribution to the literature and a splendid look at American economic and  intellectual history"

Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it"

Bawer points out that the elite run Europe without any concern for the common man."
books,4 of 7,5.0,Full of in-depth confessions.....,"Brooke Sheilds takes the reader into her own private-eye view of the world through the eyes of a mother suffering from Post-Partum Depression.  She is amazingly truthful with all that she has gone through.  Who wants to tell someone, much less the world, about thoughts of harming one's own child?  How do you get help for that?...without someone thinking you need to be institutionalized?  That fear alone, keeps a mulititude of women from seeking help for this debilitating disease.  Brooke allows herself to be put up before judge and jury, and for that, I truly admire her and her book of confessions.  She is a strong woman who has dealt with and beat, PPD.  I highly recommend the book, especially if you are in need of a sense of comradery.  Brooke lets you know that you are not alone in your suffering and gives you hope with a sense of comfort and understanding, that only one who has suffered from the disease itself could possibly offer"
books,1 of 1,5.0,great,"The 2nd best book in my opinion of the trilogy puts Drizzt finding his home in the surface world. What makes this book so great is the fact he knows nothing about the surface and its surroundings, seeing him as he develops and learns the processes of weather conditions or how he learns to build a fire to survive those harsh conditions is intriguing. In this book he befriends a old and blind ranger called mooshie, and he teaches him a little bit of everything, including the human tongue, how to follow the ways of the goddess meliki and alot of other philosophy stuff to soothe his burden"
books,1 of 1,5.0,The True War,"The One Percent Doctrine by Ron Suskind, Published by Simon and Schuster, 2006, 367 pages, is a great piece of investigative reporting.  It goes in depth into the inside world of U.S. politics and policies.  Before the table of contents Suskind chose to put a quote from Thomas Jefferson, ""Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government.""  This quote serves as a good tone for the book.  The One Percent Doctrine is not a ""Bush"" bashing book or something written for shock value, rather a book of information to help the American public.  By keeping others informed through investigative reporting Suskind is continuing one of Americas greatest constitutional rights on a time when personal freedoms are being questioned every day."

books,0 of 1,5.0,Practical Business Advices,"While lots of books give you high level theories on how to succeed in your business, they usually leave you hanging at the end of the reading not know what actions to take in order to apply the theories in your day-to-day operation. Rancic's book however has a step-by-step recount of how he did it with his cigar business. You will get specific actions that you can do tomorrow to generate sales. While other books give you general directions (and lots of bullsh&ts), Rancic tells you specifically what he had done to succeed his business, what radio station he called, how much he paids for, what's the account was, how much he charged."

books,1 of 1,1.0,Don't buy this book!,"If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS"
books,13 of 15,5.0,An Absolute Must Have For Pregnancy!,"I absolutely LOVE this book.  I grabbed a pile of books at the bookstore and looked through each one carefully before selecting this one.  It is the only best-selling guide written by a doctor with millions of copies sold.  And I know why now that I own it!!  I don't see the negative like some readers do.  It is written by a doctor, so it provides a lot of info that you'd get by talking with your doctor every day!  So there are things that you should know about even if you don't want to hear it or don't think it will happen to you!  It explains things such as bleeding during pregnancy, some common medications to avoid to prevent birth defects, pollutants to avoid and why, STDS during pregnancy, nutrition and sources/serving sizes, how your actions affect your baby's development (vaccinations, smoking, xray, falling, safety, etc.), possible tests, required tests, lying on your back, rh-sensitivity, douching, sex, backaches, exercise guidelines, air travel, car safety, breastfeeding, pregnancy discomforts (hemmorhoids, constipation, backaches, foot swelling, dizziness, breast itching, cramping, contractions), infections, hot tubs, jaundice...  It really is like having a doctor's advice for each week of your pregnancy.  It relieved alot of the worrying about symptoms I was experiencing, realizing that I was ""normal""."
books,3 of 3,4.0,Well worth reading,This book by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt is a great read even if there is nothing exactly new in it. Its strength lies in its breadth and consolidation of information.
books,18 of 19,4.0,Use with caution,"This little book written to provide insight into the myriad of Pynchon's obscure references and symbolic appellations in The Crying of Lot 49 is a worthwhile source of help if used with discretion and common sense. Although many of Grant's entries are useful to untangle some of Pynchon's more obscure references, others will simply lead you further down the path of confusion. The problem lies in the fact that while many of Grant's suggestions are useful, others simply bring about the same type of confusion that he is trying to address, since he often gives more than one possible explanation for each passage discussed. That is not to say that the book is not useful, it is, only that The Crying of Lot 49 by its very nature resists such means of explanation. But as reader of Pynchon already know, any help is welcome. As long as the reader keeps in mind that this book is meant only to introduce &quot;possible meanings&quot; and &quot;complimentary facts&quot;, which may or may not correspond to what Pynchon actually has hidden in his words. Nonetheless a good source of info and a help to anyone exasperated by the twisting and turning of Pynchon's view of the postmodern world"

books,6 of 7,4.0,Sparring intellectuals,"Norman Podhoretz was a New York intellectual in the 1950's-60's, once editor of Commentary magazine. A left-leaning writer then, in the early 70's he began leaning right and became one of the ""founding fathers"" of neoconservatism. He was an anti-Communist who rebelled against the anti-American bent of the 60's radicals. (The thought of Jane Fonda all decked out in her love beads sitting down with the North Vietnamese leadership to trash all things American still gives neocons the heebie-jeebies.)"
books,8 of 18,1.0,"Should be ""Lies In This Book""","I first thought that the book was pretty entertaining until the section on the Mining Hall of Fame.  I actually know about this museum in Leadville Co.  The author falsely alludes to the museum being a product of ""big business"" to promote their agenda.  This museum actually took many years of interested individuals' efforts to create.   The author seems to be upset because the museum doesn't tell the whole story about mining methods and their impact.  This museum was never intended to do that.  There are dozens upon dozens of mining museums across the country that does this.  The Mining Hall of Fame primarily focuses on notable people who have contributed to mining in the US.  Many of the inductees had not only a major impact on mining in the US, but also the world.  The author is critical because the type of people HE would like to see inducted in the museum are not represented, and alludes to racism.  He uses an example of a Native American ""discovering"" uranium in the 1950's in New Mexico, and asking why this person is not in the Hall of Fame.  Gee, could it be that uranium was actually discovered many years before?  After all, they did mine uranium in NM for the atomic bomb during the 1940's.  I did not finish the book because it was obvious that using actual facts were beyond the scope of this book...."
books,3 of 3,5.0,The Best Play of the 20th Century,"Samuel Beckett's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them. Is Godot God? Are Didi and Gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive, or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering?"

books,9 of 9,4.0,I chose this book as a required reading for my seminar.,"I like this book because it is very interesting and informative. I began  reading it for pleasure, but by the time I was half way finished, I was  sure of its serious nature and had decided to adopt it as a required  reading in the seminar that I teach on the economic impact of  globalization.  The author succeeds in presenting the right mix of theory  and history with sufficient analysis. It is well researched and very well  organized. It should prove as interesting to the general reader as it is  informative for the academics. However, its treatment of classical  economists is far superior to the section dealing with contemporary  writeres on free trade. Hopefully, in the second edition the author will  remedy this shortcomeing"
books,12 of 43,1.0,Breathtakingly ignorant; don't waste your money,"Dinesh D'Souza, who emigrated here from Calcutta in 1978, displays a level of ignorance of American history, politics, economics and culture that is laughable.  But for the Immigration Reform Act of 1965 - which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat D'Souza as their pet token, yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises - D'Souza probably wouldn't even be in this country.  For him to accuse both Pat Buchanan AND the Rev. Jesse Jackson of ""hating"" America demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse.  Don't bother"
books,22 of 24,4.0,A Memoir filled with Credability.,"In reflecting upon the life of James Baker through his second memoir 'Work Hard, Study . . . and Keep Out of Politics!' the one thing that continued to stay in my mind is Baker's openess that one of the reasons why he stayed in politics was 'power'.  What a refreshing statement: the Truth!  This is not so minimal a statement when reading the many self-serving political memoirs published, particularly from the Reagan-era politicians who have published throughtout the years. The life of Jame Baker is quite remarkable, and the sharing of his life and decisions as shared in this memoir are encompassing of service to this nation well done.  I may not necessarily agree with all the decisions made by Baker during the years he served 3 different presidents, but I do respect the man and the integrity of this book.  There rings certain truths throughout, and his openess about 'power' provide a sense of credability to his perspectives"
books,,4.0,SF underground,"Winchester, a geologist and proven writer, is a perfect choice for chronicling the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.  I currently live and work in SF, and enjoyed listening to the book on my mp3 player while commuting in the MUNI subways.  True to form, Winchester only spends a small amount of time on the catastrophic event itself, and instead develops the events which lead up to the event -- first in a geological perspective, and second in a sociological one."

I like how it covers many of the common scenarios, such as shooting at night, shooting at mid-day and when to use manual adjustment to accommendate difficult shots.

This can be a problem as friends sometimes expect you to reciprocate and invite them over for more than beer and peanuts.  Thanks to this book, I was actually able to have a dinner party - well two friends - over to the house on Saturday and feed them a roast chicken and green salad.  That may not sound like much to you but it was a big deal to me.  The nice thing about this book is that it doesn't make you feel stupid even if you know nothing about cooking.  For know nothings like me, it can start you at the beginning, but if you already have your four standby recipes it looks as if it could help you double or triple that number.  I recommend it for everyone"

books,4 of 5,5.0,Great Primer on the Power of the Brain,"An Anthropologist on Mars is the much anticipated follow-up to his previous best-seller, The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat. In it, Dr. Sacks further explores the recesses of the Central Nervous System's never ending quest for logic and understanding. Gestalt tells us that if we look at a broken circle long enough, the brain will fill-in the missing piece. The brain easily embraces a circle, but finds no concrete logic to a broken circle. Thus, the brain rejects such a concept as impossible. Consider our memories: most people have heard that eye witness accounts of rare events are digitized in such a way that the brain can change the sequence of events in a manner scewed toward the logical arrangment of the rare event. People who have witnessed an aircraft explode during flight most often remember this rare event quite differently immeadiatley after it happens. Plains don't explode then crash, plains crash, then they explode. That makes sense to the brain, but explode then crash does not make sense. OK, enough of Psych 101. As a neurologist, Dr. Sacks understands how the brain works, and is thus able to explain it in an easy going manner. It wasn't until a skiing accident though inwhich Dr. Sacks lost a leg, and learned first hand the phenomonon of phanthom feeling that he became fully aware of the brains search for logic. The brain hates the idea of ONE LEG, and thus continues to accept information from something that isn't even there, and, more remarkably, responds to the information. Now armed with subjectivity as well as objectivity, Dr. Sacks marshalls his considerable talent as a writer and walks a thin line in the telling of our miraculous brain. Finally, it's clear he really cares about the people he puts forth as examples of neurological insult. He offers us a wide variety of people, thier afflictions, and the results. He does seem to favor Tourette Syndrome as a perfect example of a brain run amuk. After all, Tourette Syndrome is named after a student of great French neurologist Jean Charcot. Dr. Tourette devoted his career to the study of one person who suffered from what we now call Tourette Syndrome. Dr. Sacks widens the view effectively."

Bernstein's passion to the topic makes it a clear 5 star book. And he's passions shows on almost every page. Example: if you are just interested in the Markowitz formula, don't buy this book. But if you wanna read that Markowitz's methodology is a synthesis of the ideas of Pascal, de Moivre, Bayes, Laplace, Guass, Galton, Daniel Bernoulli (especially since he's had the same nationality than me) and von Neumann & Morgenstern. Furthermore, that Markowitz's methodolgy draws on probability theory, on sampling, on the bell curve and dispersion around the mean, on regression to the mean, and on utility theory. If this history is what interests you, this book is for you (if not only for the great title & book cover)"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great Book,"When I recieved ""The Essay's of Warren Buffett..."", I have to admit I was disapointed. I could gather the essays from Mr. Buffet's Annual reports myself. However, the book's organization is where the value lays. The author has spliced together associated topics from various essays in a manner that makes it appear that they were part of one to begin with. What results is an invaluable source on Mr. Buffett's thinking on a broad range of subjects and how some of his positions have evolved over time. I was truly happy that I did not disregard what I initially percieved to be a poor purchase on my part. Enjoy"
books,1 of 1,5.0,"Very entertaining - one of the best in the ""I'm going to do something ridiculous and write about it"" genre","A.J. Jacobs journey through the Encyclopedia Brittanica is a very entertaining one, and you may learn a few totally useless things as you go through it.  A good number of books have been written recently about people's quests to do some pretty ridiculous things - cooking your way through Julia Child's MTAOFC, riding the Tour De France route by yourself, reading the entire Encyclopedia Brittanica.  This is definitely one of the best in that genre"
books,0 of 2,5.0,Quite a Different Read,"When I started reading this I only had the vaguest inclination of what the Beowulf story really was. It had everything I'd want in a story, strange characters, interesting plot, and it evoked such emotions as excitement, dread, and repulsion. I found this translation particularly interesting though because of the footnotes. The entire thing is riddled with footnotes explaining possible variations of words, different explanations and theories, etc."

books,2 of 2,5.0,"Wise, enjoyable, culimination of a larger project","Ford told me that this book, really a novella more than a novel, was his last attempt to get out of his system what he began in the Montana stories in his collection Rock Springs, although I would suggest that the Montana-based story in Women without Men which had not appeared then continues that.  What is significant to me about these stories is not the Western setting which is nice and full and accurate, or the feelings for the times, but Ford's approach to the question of the myth of parenthood.  In this book and the stories our characters are faced with the patriarchal myth of the father and the mother as people who can play such a superior role and guide the family safely through the maze of life in capitalism, always being someone to look up to by the child.  Ford brings about explosions, sometimes big explosions--in Rock Springs dad kills a guy in one story and in another story the Dad and the son come and find good old mom and an Airman in the sack--sometimes small and this myth is blown away. The child discovers that the parent is a conflicted person with all the problems and humanity that we know, open to disaster, tragedy, and just plain bad luck. Whether from the parent's point of view, or the child's what we see is this myth receding and the acceptance of real humanity by both the child and the parent.  Would that so many of this could have learned all this as wisely in life as Ford tells this in his fiction"

books,1 of 1,5.0,An unfortunate reunion sets the scene for the extraordinary ending,"When we first met the three Baudelaire Orphans, they were splashing in tide pools along Briny Beach. That is, before their lives took a turn for the worst. Now, as we meet up with them once again in this twelfth volume, we again see them upon Briny Beach. However, this time things seem as if they are looking up, for they are in the hands of good - Kit Snicket. With the pregnant Kit in tow, the three Baudelaire's are brought to the Denouement Hotel. A place kept in order by the Dewey Decimal System. The Hotel Denouement is the last safe place, and within a few days, each and every volunteer will meet up with one another, where they will celebrate the claiming of the sugar bowl over the hands of evil. However, with Sunny, Klaus, and Violet disguised as concierges, they soon learn - by using their ""flaneur"" skills - that many of the people lurking around the hallways of the Hotel Denouement are anything but good. In fact, it is while wrapped up in their clever disguises that the three orphans run into various terrible people from their past - from the unescapable Count Olaf, to the treacherous Vice Principal Nero; and the oft-times brainless Justice Strauss, to the carnival freaks known as Kevin, Colette, and Hugo. With a bit more detective work, and a little help from identical triplets Dewey, Frank, and Ernest, the orphans soon realize that while the upcoming gathering of volunteers is supposed to showcase how good triumphs over evil; the hotel is overrun by unkind masterminds who plan on wrecking the celebration. Now it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to make a very important decision...call off the volunteer gathering, or think up a way to triumph over the evil that has surrounded them ever since the day Mr. Poe informed them of their parents deaths."

This time, Reacher is in Miami, enjoying the sights and the female company, when he hears a name of his past on the evening news, James Barr.  Seems James Barr shot five innocents in Indiana for no apparent reason.  Five head shots, six bullets.  So Reacher high-tails it to Indiana, intent on keeping a promise to make James Barr suffer for this sin and a prior one.  And this will be a painful reunion for Barr."
books,5 of 5,4.0,Some True Grit Behind the Vapid Glitz,"Although far from Bukowski's best, this is a revealing send-up of what happens when brutal honesty (Buk) interacts with the California entertainment industry. A roman a clef about the making of the independent film Barfly based on Bukowski's life and some of his earlier stories,the book shows Bukowski finally gaining some recognition and acceptance near the end of his career. The movie stars Faye Dunnaway and Hollywood badboy Mickey Rourke who does a good job slurring and walking about with hemorrhoids. Yet it appears from the text that Bukowski would have preferred Sean Penn, who was originally cast in the part, to play him in the film--Penn had more heart. As always with Bukowski, there are real emotions, honest appraisals, and bone-cutting prose--not compromise, pandering, mediocrity, and unfortunately often successful attempts by MSG-dazed writers to pluck the heart strings and collect the cash.In all his books, Bukowski's presence is perhaps the most palpable of any author behind his fictional protagonist. This is, one might argue (and Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe did, in the Paradox of the Actor), the diametric opposite of actors, whose abilities lie in taking on the personae of others, and consequently losing their own identity in the process. The story is that when Bukowski, although much older, first encountered Arnold Schwazenegger in Hollywood, he had to be restrained from attempting to fight him just for being such an obvious phony. Far from his most testosterone-crazed, drunken bull self here,he does not seduce but does manage as if for old time's sake to pull onto his lap the pretty co-star during a wine-drenched film party. Even and especially when confronted with (and making some money off of) L.A.s billion-dollar dream machine, Bukowski (as alter ego Henry Chinaski) preserves his uncompromising heart and unwavering eye in the face of the ugly truth. A welcome tonic to Hollywood's treacle"

books,8 of 8,5.0,The first word on innovation,"We recommend this book to everyone involved in innovation. Whether you're involved as a creative thinker, a promoter of new products, a manager guiding the innovation process or an investor evaluating an innovative company, there's gold here for you. Authors Tony Davila, Marc J. Epstein and Robert Shelton compress a mass of research and experience in innovation practices into a set of rules and guiding principles. Then, they use stories, lucid explanations, charts and careful definitions to illustrate how these principles work. A few of these concepts could have been expanded profitably - for example, how to tell in practice when radical innovation is needed, how to determine if you're innovating too much or too fast, and how to sort out the best ideas without discouraging the creators of the rejected concepts. That's the only caveat; everything else is fascinating and immediately applicable"
books,2 of 2,4.0,Ms. Austin Would Be Pleased,"While taking a rather different direction from Jane Austin, the picture of shifting class options, alignments, and calculations reminds one of Pride and Prejudice.

It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types"

books,4 of 6,4.0,A novel of IT project management per Goldratt's Goal,"This is perhaps the only management novel for IT.  In the vein of ""the Goal"" by Goldratt, Tom DeMarco preaches the gospel of good project management.  The ideas on staffing, conflict resolution and managing to deadlines are very helpful.  The challenge is that the novel format could and should provide insight into the conflicts dealing with situations that are not ideal.  In reality, we are left with great ideas, but a lost opportunity on the difficulties of implementing them"

books,2 of 2,5.0,Distinctive and valuable history of urban growth & development,"This is a very distinctive, well researched and argued book about how Chicago developed.  Starting with a standard model of Urban Economics - the von Thunen model of central place theory- the author quickly moves beyond it.  The distinctive contribution of his book is Cronon's emphasis on how the roots of Chicago's remarkable development lay in the ""soil"" of its surrounding hinterlands. He carries this argument further by examining how the transportation and communication revolutions of the 19th century - the railroad and the telegraph - created unique advanatages for Chicago relative to other competitive metropolitan areas (such as St. Louis, Cincinnati, Milwaukee) and finally, how in turn, new metropolitan areas (such as KC, Omaha) arose to steal aways Chicago's dominance."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Highly Recommended!,"This is an insider's stroll through the confusing and ominous woods where the beasts of economic reality meet the lambs of social responsibility. Author and corporate survivor Jeffrey Hollender (who wrote this with scribe Stephen Fenichell) clearly admires the cast of socially responsible companies, such as Ben &amp; Jerry's and The Body Shop. He covers the informal history of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) movement and his own troubling experiences as chief of a company that saw itself as socially responsible. His presentation is heartfelt, if short on rigorous logic. He candidly discusses having his ideals challenged and trying to justify his compromises. The book labels some behavior socially responsible and some socially irresponsible, but its yardstick is not clear. For example, it condemns the use of child factory labor in developing countries, yet never expresses awareness of the lack of practical alternatives for those children - perhaps starvation. The book explores both the value of the Corporate Social Responsibility movement and its uncomfortable contradictions. We recommend this trip inside the hard work of melding social responsibility with business"

books,10 of 10,5.0,A Beautiful and Philosophical Book For Dog Lovers,"While attending a conference in Vermont, I was fascinated by several woodcuts of dogs by folk artist Stephen Huneck which were displayed in a local craft store. The ones which particularly caught my interest involved labrador retrievers engaged in simple tasks which captured the essence of the breed, e.g. loyalty, friendliness, joyfulfulness, and perserverance. I then noticed that the artist also had published three children's books incorporating woodcuts of his black Labrador retriever Sally at the beach, in the mountains, and on the farm. However, the book to which I was drawn both by the storyline and the pictures supplementing and illustrating the text was THE DOG CHAPEL. I learned that the author and his wife in fact live in St. Johnsbury, VT with their four dogs and that he has constructed THE DOG CHAPEL on his farm as a place that welcomes visitors of ""all creeds [and] all breeds, [but with] no dogmas allowed""."
books,10 of 11,5.0,A work that is compassionately direct yet psychologically and spiritually humane.,"For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate ""companion"" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together."
books,8 of 8,4.0,Turns a bright light on a dimly lit corner of recent history.,"Postwar is truly a huge achievement.  While it is a long book, it is actually short given how much ground Judt covers and how effectively he covers it.  the book starts with a great synopsis of some under-stated facts and thoughts about the impact that WWII had on Europe as a whole and on its constituent parts.  This book is worth reading for that synopsis alone."
books,2 of 2,5.0,A Unique and Valuable Book,"I read the book from cover to cover and was thoroughly enlightened. From a content perspective, the book is first rate. Carlberg not only explains how to forecast, but he also clarifies the pros and cons of the various methods, explains how to reduce forecasting error, and offers excellent insight into regression and the other statistics involved in making and evaluating a forecast."
books,4 of 4,4.0,Looking to learn a little something...look no further!,"The Know it All is a laugh-out loud book about a sarcastic New York editor who attempts to read the Encyclopedia Brittanica from A-Z.  Chapters are broken out by letter and topics range from important world history to weird Mensa conventions.  Although the book is set up to go through each volume in order, the author makes the book light and the reader never feels like he/she is plodding along through the alphabet just to get to Z.  What makes the book particularly interesting is the author's journey throughout the year which starts as an almost absurd self-challenge to a deeper contemplation on the value of knowledge.  Highly recommended."

On the other hand, the Penguin is more evenly balanced beetween composers (another reviewer mentions the poor coverage of Bruckner.

What I browsed through within though is seared into my conscience and really opened my eyes to the world of female lust thought. I admit, NOTHING has ever aroused me like some of the entries inside - even hardcore [...]. It's all about intent, motive, desire. Is it real? Is it sincere? You could put the most flat out gorgeous woman in front of me and she might not have anywhere near the erotic intensity of a woman who society might deem ""less than perfect"" looks-wise. It almost always is the look in her eye, or the pitch of her voice, something that conveys warmth, you know? More than anything, seeing and feeling a palpable HUNGER, an aching so deep it hurts for satisfaction. I found a lot of that energy in this book and it was DIVINE.

Lehane is good because he goes the extra mile to spin for his readers a yarn that keeps them reading and doesn't insult their intelligence -- at least most of the time.  Bubba, for example, is a caricature and totally unbelieveable but what the heck, Lehane couldn't resolve some of the plot situations without a guy like Bubba.  A plot so rich and full could easily spin out of control but Lehane is a journeyman and keeps things focused.  That's why I like him and intend to read all his books"

Women were hiding their gender identity by wearing clothes and making hair fashions similar to man. There were no make-ups or little decorations like earrings. No feminine curves were displayed publicly. From back ward or even lateral view it was hard to tell people's gender difference. Sexual desires were prohibited to display publicly. Husband and wives were denied the right of living together when they worked in different locations far apart. Prostitution were cleansed thoroughly. That is ""where we have come from"" as one of his roommates, Book Idiot Joe believes we need to know. Small wonder that when the door suddenly opened to the outside world after Mao's death, sexual suppression rebounded into ubiquitous promiscuity."

books,7 of 7,5.0,"If one man can be credited for saving Western civilization, why not Keynes?","Sitting here is Baghdad, one hears often a simple solution to the counter insurgency problem.  Usually it's some combination of winning hearts and minds and killing terrorists.  The solution may be closer to burying money in the sand.  That idea came from John Maynard Keynes who faced far larger problems than the war in Iraq.  It's been 21 years since I read Keynes' General Theory, eighty years since it was first published.  (My Econ department believed in teaching both major economic choices of the day:  Capitalism and Communism.  So I got some look at both.)  What sold me on Keynes was his General Theory.  What turned me against Marxism were my visits to Eastern Block countries where I could see its effect...on the economy and on humanity.  There is a heart inside Keynes book, the General Theory, the same heart that wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace. Keynes does get blamed for failed economic policies of those Keynesians of the sixties and seventies who believed they could tinker the economy into perfection.  Mistrust developed in Keynes General Theory.  But when I read his book, from start to finish, I came to the conclusion that people just didn't finish the book.  They must have skipped over the second half to believe you could just spend your way to prosperity or reverse bad times with clever monetary policy.  His theory has worked for 80 years.  The book may not be for you, but it is a masterpiece, something to be savored as the seminal work which transformed Classical Economics at a time when the world needed saving, when the alternative, Marxism, which stole the heart of half the globe, but would prove capable only of impoverishing and dehumanizing. The world owes more the Keynes than it acknowledges.  If you love the history of ideas, it's a must read or at least it adds a credibility to your library which a select few can appreciate"

Ms Roberts brings you into the gold and glamour of Hollywood with the same talented ease as she brings you into the green and whispers of the Olympic Rain Forest.  The characters are likable, and believable, and most certainly not your average Roberts book.  Livvy could be a pain in the butt as much as Noah could be a persistent annoyance.  And readers will find themselves grieving for Julie MacBride along with Jamie, Rob, Val, David and Livvy herself.  And there's a surprising twist at the end that will leave you reeling . ."

books,,5.0,Must Read,"If you want to understand Iraq, or war in the modern age in general, I think you must read this book.  Most wars are simply unwinnable -- as that term is commonly misunderstood in Hollywood terms.  WWI and WWII were the exceptions not the rule.  Where an when you must fight an unwinnable war, it must be by necessity and with a clearly defined objective and exit strategy.  This book illustrates these lessons vividly through the life, courage and devotion of a little known and less understood and altogether mystifying and facinating true American hero.  Even if you are not so interested in the politics and the present day relevance, it's still one great read"
books,,5.0,"Finally, G. Garvin gives us his first cookbook","My husband and I have been waiting for this book since we first saw G. Garvin on TVOne.  Needless to say, I am pleased with this book.  The layout and directions are clear and concise.  The entire book is not in color, but I can deal with that.  Here's the table of contents:"
books,1 of 3,5.0,Great Book!,This book is a great source of information that helps in a pinch. I recommend this book to all who own pets
books,1 of 1,5.0,Jame And The Giant Peach - Not Just A Fanciful Read For The Kiddies,"I think that whenever I re-read James And The Giant Peach by Roald Dahl, I am transfixed by the fact that it was merely a child's story written by the author who brought us Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Matilda and so many other wonderful classics.  Why do I love it?  I am an adult with children of my own.  Shouldn't they be reading it instead of dear old dad?  Well...yes & no.  Roald Dahl wrote many things in his lifetime and though he is remembered best for his children's fiction, he wrote a number of macabre tales and other adult-oriented stuff.  He never talked down in his books to kids and that is probably why I love James so much.  It was first read to me by a teacher in the fifth grade.  I can recall, each day at reading time, being entralled by the book, taking delight in every outlandish twist and turn.  As an adult, I gotta say, I still get a pretty big kick out of it.  So come along, join me and James Henry Trotter.  Watch out for Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker.  Is that a grasshopper, and a spider, and a centipede, and an earthworm...."
books,15 of 18,5.0,This book changed my life.,I happened on this book in a bookstore last fall. It gave me a whole new way of looking at things because it presents the history of doubt (and heresy) as a long tradition worthy of admiration.
books,2 of 2,5.0,worth every cent,"Written around 50 years ago this book still holds true. It is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success. Like most 'success' based books the concepts in here won't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple - Think Success and Gain Success. The belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success. Believing you can, will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons, it will find a HOW so you can achieve your goal. Conversely, if you believe you can't, your mind will find reasons to support your claim,"
books,5 of 6,4.0,"An Application of ""Peace in Every Step"" (Thich Nhat  Han)","I had heard of this author for a long time and never read any of her work, so it was with careful reflection and consideration that I opened this book - attracted by the ""Peace"" and ""Busy People"" of the title."
books,14 of 16,4.0,"""Make 'em laugh, make 'em weep, make 'em wait, and make 'em come back.""","This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery.  Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness."
books,,4.0,Worth the read,"I thought this book was well worth the read.  I Passed it on to my other mommie friends (who drink) and they thought is was good also.  There were plenty of parts that I could say ""Yes! that's me"" and other parts that were laugh out loud funny and shed a tear sad.  This would be a good book club book...for mommies"
books,0 of 1,4.0,Very good book I have ever read,"This book is very good for those who need a little edge. Its evaluation of human nature is very accurate. Many of the suggestions are worth trying.This book is very oreinted towards costomers a money maker, so to speak. But the psycological factors are very acurate and well described.The author uses proven psychological tactics to manipulate and control any situation.It is a very good book to try and have fun with"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Honestly Illuminating,"Magic, mystery, romance and burglary are all part of this extremely captivating adventure.  I fell in love with the characters immediately even knowing they were ""good"" thieves - hence ""Honest Illusions.""  The book begins with Luke Callahan coming back into Roxanne Nouvelle's life after a 5 year absence and then immediately flashes back to the time approximately 10 years previous when Roxy was 8 and Luke 12 when Luke joined the carnival w/Max Nouvelle, his daughter, Roxy, Lily, Mouse and their right hand caretaker back in New Orleans, LeClerc.  The flashback continues throughout more than half of the book, setting up the reader for the background information needed to tell the full story.  I felt it was necessary and definitely kept the reader interested to go back to the beginning, unlike some of the reviewers who felt the flashback was too long.  The book then picks up to the current time, but to me, the continuity of the story completely hinged on the background information.  Since I don't want to give any of the plot away, I will end my review right here.  This is a story that I would definitely re-read and hated to see end; a sure fire plot for an excellent movie"
books,1 of 4,4.0,My  review is addressed to undergraduates,It is a good book that clearly shows models to map the different types of innovation and the problems involved to manage it
books,8 of 8,5.0,ashtanga yoga,"I've reviewed most ashtanga books out there,and this is by far the best!!! The fact that it can sit on the floor with the spiral binding is a real bonus to any student or teacher.I really like how Mr. Swenson gives options to many poses giving accessability to everyone that can't stretch like ""Gumby"".Highly Recommended"
books,4 of 4,5.0,Lots of suspects,"Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone is back again in this fourth installment of Sue Grafton's alphabet series.  This time she is offered a fee to give a $25,000 cashier's check to a young man named Tony Gahan.  The check for the fee bounces and Kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her, plus the young man she is to give the cashier's check to.  Everything she finds out about her client is bad.  He is a drunk, who has killed several people in a car wreck, and appears to be a bigamist.  When he is found dead, Kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives.  This book is written in Grafton's usual breezy style, and Kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book.  I would recommend the whole series to mystery-lovers"
books,,4.0,An Up ALL NIGHTER,I was up at nights reading this. It really is a great book.
books,17 of 17,5.0,Great resource for teachers!,"This book guides you through teaching literacy through photography to children, for which Ms. Ewald is well known. It is a fantastic resource for someone who wants to really teach the heart and soul of photography, as well as visual literacy - a great introduction to photography but even a seasoned photographer can learn something new from this book. Ms. Ewald takes you through her curriculum step by step as she would teach her students and gives you the tools and tips to pass it on. This is not a technical ""how to"" photo book, there are plenty of those out there, this book is truly a gem. I have used Ms. Ewald's book as the basis for my own workshops with children and I now have adults asking me to take the course!  I can't say enough great things about it.."
books,,5.0,How to build a company you'd be proud of... and get rich from,"Jim Collins' books are well-researched, easy to read, and usually provide thoughtful, actionable guidlines for business owners. This book fits that mold in the context of describing precisely the framework that is needed to build a company that will both last a long time and outperform the market."
books,3 of 4,5.0,breathtaking tour de force,"Tim Powers is a marvellous author. This time his imagination takes you on a time-travelling trip. True, it has been done before. Just not like this. Tim Powers makes it real. The research he has done for this novel probably even has some historians starting to believe in the possibility."
books,,5.0,Best New Job Hunters Guide!,"This is the best new job hunters book to come out in years!  Vicky Oliver's answers are smart, insightful and will help any one get prepared for those interview questions that can take you by surprise.  All college grads should be issued this book with their diplomas"
books,1 of 1,5.0,A Time to Kill,A Time to Kill and The Broker are my two favs from Grisham.  Suspense is the name of the game.   I like books that make me read them straight through because they're so suspense filled. Another great novel is Deadly Behavior by Dee Sullivan.
books,,4.0,Good Book,"I don't know why some people are criticizing this book as badly as they are.  Like all fantasy books and stories, if you strip them down far enough you get the same basic story.  Characters are whats important in these books, and, while Eragon has much in common with Luke Skywalker they are different people with different personalities and experiences.  To give this anything less than 3 stars is pure hateration.  Lay off the haterade, this book continues the trilogy very well.  The training was a little dull and the romance subplot leaves a lot to be desired, but this is a good, well-written (especially for his age) novel.  I look forwarded to reading the 3rd and final installment"
books,11 of 22,1.0,You've got to wonder,"Every reviewer rates this an exceptional book and every reviewer has only rated one book, this one. Isn't that strange (rhetorical question). I read a great many reviews of trading books; go to a book by Elder or one of the other market gurus and you'll find reviewers who have read and reviewed scads of trading books. There's of course no way for me to know, but maybe the author's real talent is writing trading book reviews"
books,,5.0,Very valuable!,I highly recommend this book! It's an easy read for non-accountants! This should be in every manager's desk for quick reference. This has helped me a lot in making day-to-day decisions.
books,2 of 2,4.0,Another fun read from Nevada Barr,"I've been tearing through Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon mysteries ever since I discovered them.  The tighest and best story in my opinion is Firestorm - this one was a little harder to follow and I'm not sure I ever totally understood the denouement of the mystery.  But like with all the Pigeon novels, the characters and physical setting were interesting and well-drawn, and the story arcs that continue from book to book are intriguing, such as the relationship between Anna and her sister, and the relationship between Anna and Frederick the FBI agent (be prepared to be surprised!)  I don't think I'm going to read anything else until I've finished all the Anna Pigeon books out there - on to Blind Descent!"
books,2 of 3,5.0,"Engulfing, breath-taking","This astonishingly insightful tragedy shows the unreliable outcome that can stem from almost any (?all) of our American contemporary civil virtues, demonstrating that outcomes can't be predicted from input."
books,14 of 16,5.0,A study of the book of Romans,"This book starts in chapter 1 going over man's condition, how that man has gotten away from God, and needs to come back to Him.  Chapter 1 also tells how depraved man is and has a need for the Savior.  Chapter 2 continues in  the same vain as Chapter 1.  Chapter 3, 4, 5, show man is a sinner, there  are none that seek after God, but God seeks them.  Chapter 5 mentions that  Adam fell in the garden of Eden, but that Jesus as the new Adam did not  fall and that Jesus has paid our sin debt.  Chapter 6 tells how that those  who have accepted Christ are no longer are the Law of Moses but are free  from the penatly of sin.  Chapter 7 teaches about man's desire to do things  that are sinful, and that it is easy to do things that are sinful, but hard  to do things that are right.  Chapter 8 mentions that those who are in the  Spirit with Jesus and are joint heirs with Him. Chapter 9 tells about  Abraham and Elijah, as well as the fact that Sarah would have a child is  told about.  Chapter 10 tells about man's need for Christ and how that man  can accept Christ.  Chapter 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 cover the Old  Testament people, the fact that Christians should offer up themselves as a  living sacrifice to Christ.  The obeying of laws of the land, and to higher  powers.  That after accepting Jesus, He will be our comforter, our help in  time of trouble. Chapter 15 talks about Paul's ministry, and Chapter 16 is  a personal greeting to those he knows who have accepted Jesus Christ as  their Savior"
books,,5.0,Cities of the Plain,Incredible. One of the best novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. McCarthy is a master story teller. I have never read a book by him I did not fall in love with.
books,3 of 3,4.0,"Far, far better than the newest movie.","Okay, I went into this book after seeing the remake of Haunting of House Hill. I've never seen the original and can only pray that it does more justice to the book."
books,,4.0,"worthy, not perfect","I have just finished Mr.Judt's tome on modern Europe. I am a little embarrassed to admit that it took me several months. I enjoyed learning the information; the book is certainly filled with detail. It is not by any means an easy read or a ""page turner, "" however. Although I agree with some other reviewers that the US' role is deemphasized a bit, overall I felt the author was fairly objective. In contrast to a reviewer's comment that the French will love this book, I would argue that the author reveals the French during this period  as deeply flawed. Certainly the Soviet leadership  properly receives a great deal of blame, as do many of the citizenry throughout Europe.  I agree that the book's strength lies in the breadth of the information, which at first seems overwhelming but is kept semi-manageable. Mr. Judt is less successful in neatly synthesizing all the info, but I personally think that that is primarily a realistic function of the subject matter. I did find the epilogue discussing specifically the treatment of jews a little jarring in its placement."
books,4 of 4,4.0,D is for delightful,"Sue Grafton does a great job keeping this series fresh and interesting. Four books in and I still can't wait to read more! And she gets better with each book. In this book (and to a smaller degree in 'C') there were many times where I couldn't fathom how Kinsey would keep on the trail and solve the case. But she always manages to plausibley get back on the trail without causing the reader to lose interest. Kinsey's development as a character is also very well done. She is a very real, likeable person with amazing depth"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Interesting Insight,"I was not familiar with Thomas Friedman's New York Times columns.  This book contains a sampling of his columns.  The book mainly portrays the difference in the Arab vs. the culture of the West. The book opens with the shock of the events of 9/11, considered a tragedy by the West and a cause for celebration for many places in the Arab and Muslim world."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Must have for new moms!,"As an expecting first time mom, I have a lot on my mind and this book has helped me think through a lot of those concerns.  The Expert's Guide to the Baby Years has given me fantastic insight into many of the issues I'm facing while pregnant and those I'm sure to face in the coming months and years.  It has been a lot of fun to read all of the topics such as how to ""Choose a Name"", ""Dress Your Baby"" and ""Nurture Your Marriage.""  This beautiful book would be a great gift, as I'm sure every new mom would benefit from and enjoy reading advice from the experts."
books,,4.0,Deaver and Rhyme are back,"After 2-3 terrible Lincoln Rhyme books Deaver gets his act together in The Cold Moon.  As a big Lincoln fan, I am hoping this continues, as I was ready to stop buying Rhyme books.  If you haven't already read Bone Collector, Empty Chair and Coffin Dancer, you're missing out"
books,2 of 3,5.0,Germany before WW II,"This book is the second in a planned three book series about the Nazis, and it covers the time period from Hitler's ascension to office and the invasion of Poland. In a very lucid fashion, the author explains how the Nazis in power changed the face of Germany. We are given culture, arts, politics, religion, the family, and other subjects, and can readily observe how Germany was transformed, for the worse, by the Nazi party. It is a chilling tale of a people that allowed themselves to be seduced by propaganda, and even though the book shows that not eveyone was happy with the government, things just went along because Hitler appeared to be able to accomplish almost anything he wished. Once again, we see how the reluctance of the Western countries enabled him to accomplish what should not have been possible. It's a morality tale for our time, because it seems that now most of the world justs sits by while Iran works on a nuclear option, and hopes that things will just turn out all right in the end. Reluctance to confront evil is no option any more, as this book very well shows."
books,,2.0,The Cgi/Perl Cookbook,"The scripts are buggy and don't even work out of the box and they certainly aren't well written enough for a production website. The contact email address in them bounces, perhaps the author's gone into hiding in shame."
books,,5.0,VERY ENJOYABLE,"I love Doris Kearns Goodwin's work, and this book is no exception. It's very different from her other books, but very enjoyable.  It brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers."
books,5 of 5,5.0,A masterpiece of writing,"Although though it may be hard to begin Vollmann's &quot;7 Dreams&quot; series because each book in the series is so massive, it is certainly worth the time. Not only is Vollman attempting to create, with some fiction, the entire history of North America, each volume he writes is a totally new undertaking. New people, names,histories, and unique grammar reflective to  the period. A truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice, Vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears, but since each is complete in itself, that does not matter.  I look forward to his next &quot;dream.&quot"
books,5 of 5,5.0,An absolute masterpiece,"""Spring Snow"" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written, as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right.  It is an eloquent, moving story with a ""tale as old as time,"" that of star-crossed lovers who's love transcends social roles and obligations."
books,3 of 5,5.0,Revealing Common Sense Reflection,"My husband brought this home, and reading some of it, it reflects some very common sense realities about politics, along with some fairly harsh criticisms of many of the &quot;players&quot; associated with campaigns and elections. A long time Boston resident and close to the action in most cases, the author exhibits an uncommon knowledge of more than a few &quot;events&quot; and cautions the readers to try and look beyond the momentary hype to assess the value and the progress of our American political campaigns to see who really winds up on top, and too often, who really winds up on the bottom, and often screwed. A highly informative read, and one that appeals to logic as the ruler by which American democracy is played out, and its relation to &quot;ordinary citizens.&quot;"
books,1 of 1,4.0,"A fantastic, emotional, page-turning read.","READ THIS BOOK!  You don't have to be a transsexual, homosexual, male, or female to get a lot out of this book.  I'm a married heterosexual female and read this book with an open mind, and am so glad I did so.  Kholsa's transition from a female body to a male one that matched his male brain offers insights on the societal and biological constructs of gender and how our bodies are hard-wired to think and behave in certain ways by our hormones, our sociology, and so many other things.  The fact that Kholsa has experienced both sides can help you learn more about yourself and the opposite sex than you ever thought possible."
books,14 of 15,5.0,Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career,"This book is a treasure of intimate details and provides a unique perspective on the 1920's, 30's and 40's.  This is not a stereotypical romantic view of that time, but a gritty investigation of the life of Kay Francis and the Hollywood elite.  It is well written with numerous authentic photographs and references to the private journals of Kay and her decadent world.  It is an honest and revealing portrait of an individual and how ""the other half lived"".  I highly recommend this book for history and movie buffs both"
books,,5.0,A convert to the power of consensus,"I began this book with a healthy dose of skepticism.  On more than one occasion I've been involved in ""consensus"" decision-making processes that were less than stellar.  (As an employee, a board member, a community member and business owner.)  In the hands of an unskilled, or manipulative, or misguided (or worse, downright deceitful) facilitator a so-called consensus decision-making process can leave you feeling like your pocket has been picked.  You know exactly what I mean.  When you finish the ""process"" and feel like you've been hoodwinked into agreeing to something because:"
books,3 of 3,5.0,"If you follow him, the average guy can't loose","This is by far the best investing book I have read. I just gave Jim Cramer's book, Real Money, a 3 star rating for lack of usable info on top of his 400 pages of egoistical ramble."
books,7 of 7,5.0,The Eye of the Storm,"I must admit that I normally am not drawn to books about natural disasters, yet after seeing a documentary on the Galveston hurricane and finding this book, my curiosity overcame me.  Also, I had recently read and enjoyed Larson's book ""The Devil in the White City"" and felt certain that he would be a thorough and more than competent narrator to tell this story.  I must also admit that recent natural disasters only heightened my interest in the storm that is considered the deadliest hurricane in history."
books,,4.0,Dog Training,"I felt this was a good book that had a lot of good ideas in it. However, the book was filled with a lot of nonsense type things that I felt really just made the book longer and less enjoyable.  I ended up skimming a lot of the stuff.  A lot of the book talked about nutrition and how that affects behavior. I just felt it was too much info for a dog training book.  I would recommend it though because it was reasonably priced and did tell me what I wanted to knw"
books,9 of 12,5.0,How To Think Like Benjamin Graham And Think Like Warren Buff,"I am an 18 year old high school student who read this book for my economics class.  I have recently opened an online investing account and have been working hard to learn all I can about the market and how to excel in it. I really feel that this was a great book for me since it covered everything about investing.  If you are just getting into the market like me, I definitely suggest that you read this wonderful book since it really does give you that extra knowledge about the stock market that others dream to have.  If you already know a ton about the market and investing, all I can tell you is that there must be something in this book that you will learn.  Basically, here's my overall view. Read the book if you want to be different from all the other investors who think they know everything there is to know about the market.  I also believe that this is a great investment of your money and time, since it is sure to help you in your future investments"
books,9 of 12,5.0,A Book To Make Life Easier,"I'm a fan of Real Simple magazine, so this book hit the spot for me.  It gives you ideas for reusing items.  Now I know what to do with the stack of dryer sheets that I'd been saving.  There are inexpensive tips and lots of how-to advice.  Some may sound familiar, but there's bound to be some you had not thought of before."
books,13 of 16,5.0,A Lot About Nothing At All,Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct.
books,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent choice for a literature class,"I used this memoir as one of three core texts for an intensive summer course and my students loved it. It is beautifully written, poetic and very honest. I lived in Iran from 1983 to 1993 and I believe this is the most accurate memoir of life in Iran that I have read"
books,,5.0,Great resource,I bought these for our staff on our elementary school newspaper. The kids not only felt like real reporters with these.....the notebooks helped to keep the student reporters more organized and gave them guidance for writing their stories. The Reporters Notebook was a worthwhile investment for the staff and I will buy more next school year.

books,1 of 1,5.0,BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING. BECOME INVISIBLE!,Let me start by saying that The Invisibles is by far my favorite comic book of all time. It is such a demanding and rewarding experience. I read the entire series at least once a year and not once have I grown tired or bored by a single page or panel.
books,,5.0,required reading...,Everyone should turn off their tv's for a few hours and sit down and read this book. Simply the most informative book I've read this year.
books,,5.0,Pawprints of History,"This is an excellent and well-researched book describing how humans and dogs have interacted through history. It includes a wealth of interesting information about both individual and societal attitudes towards dogs and how those attitudes impacted events. Although the book is about the role of dogs in history, the stories humanize historical events by showing how compassion towards or fear of dogs affected individual people and societies. Great book."
books,,4.0,"Good, not great.","I had never read any of Dr. Schlessinger's books until about a month ago when I read her book ""The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands"". It was a magnificent read and prompted me to pick up this one, 10 STUPID THINGS COUPLES DO TO MESS UP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. The problem is, I should have read this book first, and here is why; Proper Care was such a masterpiece that I expected as much from this one, and though it is a wonderful dissertation and full of valuable advice, it doesn't come close to being in the same category as Proper Care. Had I read this book first, my expectations would not have been as high and I probably would have rated this one higher."
books,1 of 2,5.0,Great book!,Thought the book was great and factual.  Certainly worth the time and money
books,10 of 21,2.0,Impractical. Over complicated!,"Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, I really cant appreciate the value, usefulness or practicality of this book. The proposed framework, that each difficult conversation is really three (The ""What Happened?"", The ""Feelings"" and The ""Identity"") Conversations, is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem. You may think I am a contrarian or a poor communicator. However, with my very positive experience (and reviews) on books like ""How to win friends and influence people?"" by Dale Calegie, ""Get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again"" by David J. Lieberman , ""How to talk to anyone?"" by Leil Lowndes and so on, I am obliged to warn potential buyers, in particular regular readers of relevant books, of a big disappointment."
books,1 of 4,5.0,A very interesting Book,"This is an extremely interesting book with wonderful insights of the Human development,"
books,14 of 15,5.0,A Complete Overview of the Bison's Near Demise.,Andrew Isenberg provides a complete overview of the near demise of the American Bison in late 19th century. The author's principle theme is an explanation of the causes for the near extinction of the largest North  American mammal in the largest North American biome. Isenberg provides an  extensive description of how the reintroduction of horses to North America  uprooted  many Native American peoples of the plains and exaggerated their  dependence on the bison. This increased dependence on bison was further  fueled by the fur/hide trade of the early 19th century. The near death note  to the American bison was provided by the east's increased need of leather  component's for it's expanding industry and desire by the Euro-American  populace to displace bison dependent Native Americans. If you are  interested in complex cause/effect senarios in American history this book  is a must. The book has been extensively researched and provides an awesome  reference list
books,7 of 7,5.0,Great Practical Tools,"If you've ever wondered about how to have a single conversation that will make a difference, this book will provide the guidance for that conversation.  Scott is quite skilled at creating a simple approach to difficult situations."
books,29 of 29,5.0,"To Conquer the World, First Conquer Yourself","Julius Caesar was one of the truly pivotal people in recorded history.  Most non-historians know him as the one who was stabbed by Brutus on the Ides of March. It is almost as if Caesar sprang full-grown to grab the reigns of power from the Senate in Rome.  Yet Caesar had a fairly long life before he became First Citizen of Rome.  He was a successful general and a talented historian who saw world events with the dispassionate eye of one who felt supremely confident that his tenure as an army general was but the last stop before his ascension to ultimate power.  In his CONQUEST OF GAUL, Caesar uses the third person point of view to punctuate his tacit assumption that unfolding events ought to be divorced as far as possible from the one witnessing them.  This writing technique also served to symbolize his stated goal: to conquer Gaul.  To him, Gaul was a land of barbarian tribes, with each possessing formidable numbers and fierce fighters.  These tribes and their leaders were enormously emotional, wildly unpredictable, and more dangerous as individuals than as organized units.  Caesar knew that to beat them, he could not be as them.  They were emotional, he coldly calculating.  They were not efficient in massed groups, his legions had to be. Caesar was the ultimate practitioner of the divide and conquer school.  He picked off his enemies one at a time, like bobbing heads on a shooting gallery.  The Atuatucii, the Nervii, the Helvetians all fought ferociously, sometimes winning minor victories, but it was Caesar who won the ones that counted.  He transformed his legions into extensions of his personality.  They fought well as masses against overwhelming odds, not for their pay, or hope of plunder, or even for glory, but for their commander.  Caesar's iron will and resolve filled his legions with hope and his enemies with despair.  It was only when Caesar was recalled to Rome that the Gauls decided that now was the time to seek a new leader to strike down the Roman eagle.  During this battle against Vercingetorix and his earlier ones against lesser chiefs, Caesar sees each battle as the logical working out of a master plan, that when combined with the bravery and training of his troops in co-ordinated combat, could crush a loud but awkward foe.  As he writes, one can visualize his intended audience, not the reader of this review, but the purple-robed senators back in Rome sweating out the increasing victories of a man who seemed fated to return to the Capitol to tell them their business.  His calmness in battle was matched only by his calmness with a stylus.  It is truly ironic that it was this same calm that led him to discount the excited warnings of a Mark Antony, who tried to tell Caesar of plotters, that led to his downfall"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Much Different from the Movie - and Better,"This is a dramatic and tense story of a young law school graduate who gets a job offer that is too good to be true.  Of course, it turns out that he doesn't get the full story until after he accepts the job.  The rest of the story entails the exciting efforts to get him and his wife out of their desperate situation.  Like most Grisham novels, this is a fun and fast read that many readers would classify as light fiction."
books,6 of 6,5.0,The Body of Love:  Inquire Within,"Love of Knowledge is a very interesting piece of experimental literature.  Not all the experiments succeed (the short poems and drawings are definitely a product of the time and are for now at least retro-cool), but all are useful to the reader.  Every gesture Tarthang Tulku makes in this book accumulates and contributes to a particular effect:"
books,6 of 6,5.0,"""Anubis Gates"" by Tim Powers","This book is easily one of the 10 best books I've ever read. It turned me on to the works of writer Tim Powers, and I have now read every one of his novels (and most of his short stories, as well). ""The Anubis Gates"" is easily one of his masterpieces. It is usually lumped under SF or Fantasy in bookstores, because they honestly don't know what to make of it - it IS both SF and Fantasy, but so much more. For lovers of dark, modern fantasy - or anyone who loves a great time-travel tale unlike any other - this book is highly recommended. I also recommend Powers' ""Last Call"" - but it is not for the faint of heart"
books,,5.0,"Another Rave  Review, Not That One's Needed","With several hundred Amazon rave reviews, it seems overkill to add another, but what the heck:  ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is an outstanding piece of work by one of the best.  Connelly's ability to weave a compelling story in among the hills and bars (the drinking bars as well as the  ones before which you conduct trials) borders on magic.  The plot here is amazingly diabolical -- just when you think you know where it's going, Connelly pulls the rug away.  Haller is a wonderful character, delightfully shady and opportunistic but with a (somewhat tarnished) heart of gold. I hope Connelly keeps bringing him back.  But I hope he doesn't retire Bosch, either.  I think Connelly should turn out two books a year -- one of each guy.   I know it won't happen, but I can dream.  Thanks again, Mr. Connelly, for keeping me delightfully awake these past few nights."
books,3 of 23,1.0,Big talk big deal.,"For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Thank God for turtlenecks.....,"Add Nora Ephron to our list of turtleneck icons - Katherine Hepburn and Diane Keaton.  Katherine knew what she was doing. Rarely did we catch a glimpse of her neck.  And Diane made us all proud in ""Something's Gotta Give"", looking fabulous in all her mock turtles - even when she told Jack to ""cut it off"".  Nora has hit the nail on the head with this one - from our feelings about purses (and I'm not sure the manufacturers aren't somewhat to blame for our hatred of them - I often picture purse designers howling with glee as they mis-locate inner pockets or leave them out entirely - or put in so many that we walk around the house looking for items to fill them up) to hairstyle frustrations (what does one do with smooth, silky hair that overnight becomes stiff and bristley or starts to grow in the most unlikely places?).  I felt I was reading my own journal most of the time.  She lost me when she delved into the agony and ecstacy of New York apartment ownership and rent controls - but, what the heck, it's good for us ruralites to hear about the the trials of city living.  I loved this book - it's short and a quick read - and the perfect aging girlfriend gift.  Okay, Nora - now, please write another ""When Hally Met Sally"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""You've Got Mail"".  Meg Ryan is starting to wear turtlenecks, so time's a'wastin'!"

books,,1.0,A Truly Awful Book,"Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel ""The Short Forever"".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought"
books,3 of 3,5.0,A Lifeguard in a Whole Lot of Trouble,"Palm Beach lifeguard Ned Kelly has the perfect life. Then he meets seductive and very beautiful Tess McAuliffe. They go out and she's the one as far as he's concerned, however she's tres classy and lives way above his lifestyle. So he decides to throw in with four childhood friends, Mickey, Bobby, Dee and Barney, who have come up with a nice little score that will set them up for life."
books,6 of 6,5.0,A Benchmark in Customer Value Management,"This is the type of book that can change an entire corporate vision. The authors are meticulous in presenting their philosophy, and back every word with carefully researched examples from best practice companies. Unlike  many of the &quot;quick read&quot; publications that present a superficial  view of service (particularly from a marketing perspective), this book is  clearly the result of several years work in the field. Every corporate  manager who is serious about customer value management needs to take some  time out to study the Service Profit Chain"

books,0 of 1,5.0,Fantastic Book,This is a great overview that has helped me personally and when explaining real estate investments to my clients. Information is absolutely power in this case.
books,4 of 4,5.0,How to Speak Dog,"Very well written. It connected a lot of dots for both my wife & myself, bringing better understanding about us as well as our dog friends. We've always believed that when you train your dog you also are training yourself. We have loved all of our 'friends' that have shared their lives with us & are just now beginning a new bond with our third Dalmatian puppy. Anyone that has had any experience around this breed knows the special Aura they wear & this book is a 'must read' for You."
books,3 of 5,5.0,A Well written Yarn for a Cold Weekend,"A number of reviewers have complained about this book saying that it really wouldn't happen this way, that the twists and turns of the plot which is a staple with Mr. Deaver are too far fetched to believe."

books,1 of 1,5.0,One of the best,"I think I was suppsoed to read this book in High School and I either didn't or i watched the movie instead. Either way, I am glad I finally did.  This book is one of the best ever written.  It makes me sad to think that so many people have not and will not read it.  Harper Lee was ahead of her time in so many ways.  Buy this book. Read it now. Go"
books,,2.0,Rambling and sporadic,"I thought this book was all over the place, but maybe that was because I only read it before I went to bed. There were flashbacks and flash forwards and I thought the author was trying to be overly clever.  None of the characters were really that interesting to me.  It was sad that Jean didn't really have any friends and to be so old and know practically no one.  Wow!  I hope I don't end up like that when I am her age.  How could a married couple go on for 30 or 40 years and never tell each other such basic things.  What a miserable life!  I am glad this book was short or I would have put it down sooner."
books,,5.0,A good read on raising a reader,"This book had great practical advice for each stage in your child's reading life.  Particularly helpful were the suggestions on overcoming difficult stages when children might tend to become apathetic towards reading. I also appreciated the emphasis on the total experience of reading, rather than the simple ability to identify words on a page.  In addition I found it reassuring to hear that my husband's and my own enjoyment of reading will go a long way towards influencing our kid's desire to read"
books,1 of 2,4.0,diamonds aren't the girl's best friend,"But the bones of the man attaced to a case of diamonds are the girl's best friend, and she's trying to find them to prove the bones match her DNA.  This mystery features a scramble along the Grand Canyon to find the missing bones, deposited as a result of a legendary 1956 airplane crash.  An unscrupulous lawyer also wants the bones, to prevent the lady from making her claim to the billion dollar inheritance.  Navaho and Hopi policemen from Hillerman's many books get involved in the hunt too."
books,6 of 13,5.0,My obsession,"I was just 2 years old when this movie came out, but my grandfather taped it for me on Beta.. When I was about 3 I started watching the Beta tape.. Let's just say I drove my family CRAZY with this movie! I watched it in its entirety EVERY day.. I memorized every single line. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone!! I now have it on VHS, but am praying one day it will go to DVD because when I have kids some day I would like them to be able to enjoy this movie. It's a fun family movie. It has an all-star cast and is very enjoyable!! I definitely think you all should watch it"
books,15 of 17,4.0,"a very ""enlightening"" book","Pay no attention to reviews about this book. Read and dicide for yourself what is going on in these 500 pages of mind boggling information. You can't really take the book as proven fact, though, as Cooper has mentioned this in a disclaimer in the front of the book, himself."
books,,5.0,A nice surprise,"I got ""Black Order"" without knowing the author or hearing anything about the book. I have to give props to a book that makes me seek out more by that author, which is exactly what happened after reading this one. Since then, I've only read an earlier Rollins book (""Amazonia"") but I can already see that in later books, he's willing to inject a little more humor. ""Black Order's"" Fiona is one of my favorite characters I've encountered in a long time. She's fiesty, hilarious and so cool. The writing is more colorful, the way he frames the stories is more skillful in this book than ""Amazonia."" And it's got enough meat for the smart set: lots of history, travel, nature, philosophy. I heard the audiobook version and it did drag a little when the science got too heavy -- but there was enough fast-paced action to balance it all. Rollins has to be a fan of the James Bond and ""Indiana Jones"" b/c you definitely see elements of those in his work. That's all fine with me because I say: bring on more Sigma Force!"
books,0 of 4,4.0,Fascinating Insight,The author has done a good job on this one putting together a through biography of a man who fiercely guarded his privacy.  The information gathered to create this book required much research by the author and the results that he has pieced together reveal insight into one of America's most enigmatic heroes.  A good read

books,8 of 18,1.0,I Wonder If That Soapbox Is Ancient-Forest Wood,"I was very much looking forward to recieving this title from Amazon.com after reading the first few pages online. And, admittedly, I did like the first few chapters; however, the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly, and became almost smug and self-aggrandizing. The authors seemed far too pleased with themselves, and, by approximately the halfway point I felt as if I were reading some kind of bizzare Conservationist Manifesto. I like to think - as a self-appointed conservationist and vegan - that I try to mind Mother Nature and all living creatures, but after I finished reading this repetitive, pedantic bore, I lost the will to care. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter; then, it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant. Others liked the book, and that's fine; But I was disappointed"

books,0 of 2,4.0,A page-turner that doesn't teach you card tricks,"It's a Robin Hood-story of a group of math students from the MIT-ivory tower using their brains to get rich at Las Vegas giants' expenses. I must say it is truly a page turner and if you weren't interested in Blackjack before, you increase your chances of becoming. Looking back, the story is almost too clich�, but if you immerse yourself without skepticism, you'll will love it!"
books,2 of 2,4.0,Not a tourist...or a native?  This book is for you.,"My boyfriend and I recently moved the the city.  Both of us had visited Chicago multiple times and knew the very basics but realized we needed more guidance in navigating the streets and making our way through the maze of information we were finding online regarding apartments and neighborhoods.  The Not for Tourists Guide was the best investment we have made since deciding to move (excluding the fantastic Bucktown loft we ended up choosing).  Although the simple, and usually cheesy, neighborhood descriptions leave something to be desired, this guide was extremely helpful in figuring out the basics of each area of the city.  When searching for places to live, it was great to be able to pinpoint the location on the clear and detailed maps and know exactly how far each prospective home was from grocery stores, banks, shops, restaurants and L stops.  (Of course nothing was more valuable than actually seeing the neighborhoods...for which the NFT Guide was extrememly helpful while plotting our route.)  We still keep the guide within reach while exploring new parts of the city...and it has saved us multiple times while trying to find alternate routes around crazy traffic flow."
books,,4.0,"My first Grisham Book, and it was worth the Time","John Grisham has quite a reputation as being a very prolific author.  Being the best selling author the 90's means you've got quite a reputation.  So I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I picked up ""A Time to Kill.""  Needless to say it was a good book, but there are a few moments where it glares.  As it is Grisham's first book (and believe me, in some areas it shows), I'd expect a lack of substance.  Surprisingly, there's substance.  But there are times when the book really rambles on for a very long time."
books,1 of 3,1.0,"It's bad, baby...","I saw a documentary on ""Hank"" Bukowski, and thought I'd give him a day in court. This was the only work of his available at the library, so this is what I sampled. It's crap. A waste of time. Bukowski's reputation certainly can't rest on this alone. Did he pull an esoteric fast-one, and write this just for the initiated? Maybe. The book still sucks"
books,3 of 4,4.0,Of Mice & Men meets Da Vinci Code,"A swirling canvas of art scams, art history, and Australian attitude is just backdrop. This book is really about two brothers, Slow Bones and Butcher Bones aka Hugh and Michael Boone. One is mentally impaired (he thinks in capital letters and likes to sit on metal folding chairs and watch the traffic go by.) The other is an artist. Each, by his nature, must be different from the rest of the world. Slow Bones can't save himself in social situations or manage city thoroughfares. And Butcher, though more adept, is just as likely to tick everyone off by his insatiable needs to gratify His Art."

books,1 of 3,4.0,Fascinating but not profound,"I found this book to be highly readable and to stand as an important example of immigrant and post-immigrant fiction. The Chinese-American experience is different from the Jewish-American experience or the Irish-American experience, but they also have a great deal in common. Tan successfully portrays the younger generation's desire to conform to American ideals and the older generation's often stubborn resistance to acculturation. Somewhere in between lies a happy medium that is often not attained until a third or fourth generation."
books,5 of 38,1.0,Lies and bad arguments,"I have a Ph.D studying the Christian right and this is the worst book on Fundamentalism and the Christian Right that I have ever seen.  What is not outright lies are ""straw men"" arguments meant to make anyone who believes in Christianity look like an idiot.  I feel bad for the people who gave it a good review, they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the Christian Right, they are feeding propoganda for their own side.  I was given a free copy of this book and after reading it, I threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library, it is that bad.  Be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it, especially on a controversial topics like this one."

books,,4.0,not as good,"As near as I can determine, I have read everything by James Lee Burke that is in print. Though his prose continues to captivate me, his latest novel is not one of my favorites. I am confused about how both Dave and Cletus are portrayed, and Dave's relationship with his latest wife also baffles me. I plan to reread this book after some time has passed (as is my custom with all of Burke's books) and see if the problems I think are there have been resolved by some subconscious mental wanderings in the interim"
books,7 of 25,5.0,Knowledge Thriller,Intellectually challenging content. My thinking was engrossed and put to the test at its maximum limits.
books,17 of 24,4.0,Fukuyama continues to dazzle,"What makes Francis Fukuyama such a special author is his ability to 1) take large, complicated subjects such as the dynamics of industrial economies or the breakdown of the American family and substitute them with  larger and more substantive themes.  He brings social science back to its  grand roots, broadening the circle of human understanding.  2) Fukuyama has  a unique gift to push the public dialogue into new and unchartered  territory.  He challenges people to think differently.  He accomplishes  this again in &quot;Trust.&quot;  It is an impressive book which  re-connects the issues of culture and economics.  His thesis that public  values, especially trust, shapes the direction of national economies is  well-proved by the author.  I will add, though, that the book got a bit  long-winded at times.  It seemed to lack focus periodically, especially in  the heart of the book.  I would have also preferred that Mr. Fukuyama spend  more time examining the United States.  I do not see why it should receive  the same attention as the other countries, ranging from Japan to Italy.  I  would also have been interested to hear more about his feelings about how  communism will impact Russia's culture and economic future.  But these mild  criticisms do not greatly impact was is an important and interesting work"
books,,4.0,Teacher's Grade: B+,"The Charlie Bone series is an entertaining one, and all the kids I know who read it want to keep reading more.  That's my goal as a teacher, so I try not to quibble with the gigantic plot holes that exist in the world Nimmo has created.  Nor do I care that the main character seems to have no personality.  He merely serves as a plot anchor."
books,4 of 4,4.0,A Collection,"""Nine Stories"" is a collection of stories written by J.D. Salinger, that were published in other media before he made his mark in literature.  Collected in this popular book, we see hints of what makes Salinger's writing an American treasure."
books,0 of 1,4.0,An Amazing Look at Love & Death & Being in the Limelight,"Just as I said in the title-- this is an amazing look at love and death and being in the spotlight when you enter that inner circle of the famous or society...not the infamous, not the instant celebs...but the inner circle of names that make America what it is...Carole Radziwill married ""John John's"" cousin, son of Lee radziwell (Jackie O's sister). And because of this she entered the inner Kennedy circle and coincidentally became one of Carolyn (John's wife) best friends....Some fascinating stuff here-- I think many of us assumed that Carolyn and Carole were both upper class-- they appear to have been middle class and even worked at the same department store in NYC at one time where they had to wear yellow aprons. Of course Carolyn worked in cosmetics dept and Carole worked in customer service...The fascinating part of this book is that Carole is able to somehow view both the yin and yang of her marriage and the relationship with the Kennedy family --especially John and Carolyn...Carole's husband gets cancer and is actually dying the week that John and Carolyn's plane crashes...Carole is the one who has to notify the Coasts Guard and Carolyn's family....It's a great book to read to show that you can be happy and sad at the same time. I appreciate her honesty-- she signed up for love and roses and got death and dying much of the time...now it's time for her to get her own life again...a former news researcher...she spent much of her married life taking care of a sick and/or dying husband and then dealing with the Kennedy tragedy too...fascinating book.."

books,6 of 6,1.0,"Good grief, another Hack writer cashing in on Wicca!","If I had the option to, I would permanently ban Conway from ever writing another book. She gleefully displays her lack of knowledge on a plethora of topics, from basic Wicca to Ceremonial Magick, to history and mythology, and the list goes on and on. If this book were shelved under fiction, it would be better, but it purports to knowledge that is obviously made up on the spot, with no historical references cited."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Very profound and Spirit inspired book!,During a very difficult stage in my life the Lord led me to this book. It is without a doubt one of my favourites. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. Why? Well it teaches on lust and the reason we are sometimes tied to others in relationships that may sometimes not even be God's will for our lives.
books,4 of 5,5.0,A great American travel memoir,"This book is vital and interesting, even across the gulf of the 40-odd years since it was written. Steinbeck writes to us from the far side of the 60's ""generation gap"" and even the far side of post-World War II industrialization and urbanization."

Friendships are put on the line, and trust is tested. At the end of the year, Hogwarts is put in an extremely difficult situation, leaving readers eager to read the 7th installment. J.K. Rowling's The Half-Blooded Prince continues to deliver the all of the magic that readers first fell in love with."
books,4 of 6,5.0,The Grand Caeser's Ego Trip,"So I pick up this book (it was a gift from friends), and expect it to be dull and dry like Tacitus or Plutarch.  Instead, Caeser has me rolling (well, not exactly) with laughter.  He writes in a very historically accurate way, but since this is a piece of propaganda, he tends to lay the blame for mistakes on someone else, or rationalize his breaks from the Roman authority.  Caeser also belittles the natives of most of Gaul (except the Belgae, &quot;the most fierce&quot;), and when he destroys an entire village, he states it in such a cool and nonchalant way (&quot;and so the village was burnt, and all of the citizens put to the sword.&quot;)  While caeser may not have intended to be funny, this book is a wonderful piece of history which must be taken as a historical tall tale"
books,29 of 30,5.0,The Real Deal,"For all of you investors who want to invest like Warren Buffett - that is, successfully - this is what you really want to read.  There are a large and growing number of books out there that will claim to make you think/act/be like Buffett; here you can actually read his thoughts.  As WB has often said, go to the source material (not the analyst reports, etc.) to make your judgments, and that is true in studying Buffett as well."
books,,5.0,Ponzi,"Written like a novel, this is the true story of Charles Ponzi, the most famous con man using the ""rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul"" scam. I found the book to be entertaining without a dull spot. After several unsuccessful cons, he started with a small stake and took people's money and paid them 50% in 45 days. When other people heard, the number of investors mushroomed. He finally made about $8,000,000 (in the 1920's) in this pyramid scheme before he was caught"
books,17 of 21,5.0,Everyone needs to understand the dangers of fundamentalism,"This book is wonderful at revealing the evils of religious fundmentalists.  It should be read by everyone including the religous.  It is very dense in information; with 900 references, it reads almost like a college textbook and cannot be dismissed as simply a collection of anti-religious opinions.  Be prepared to read a paragraph or a couple and have to put it down and think for a while."
books,10 of 13,5.0,The More Things Change the More they Stay the same,"It is amazing how little has changed in our political dialogue in the 40+ years since this book was written.  Friedman had chapters about social responsibility of business, taxes and incentives, free trade, vouchers and the role of government in the education system, and ""fair"" distributions of income, and trade protectionism to protect domestic industries and workers from ""unfair foreign competition."""
books,8 of 9,5.0,We love the Joy of Cooking,"This was a gift to my mother-in-law to replace an old copy that is falling apart...We love the Joy of Cooking, especailly the older editions (I'm not very familiar with the new one yet)...I use it as a reference whenever I'm dealing with some ingedient or process I've never seen/done before. Before I cook I use Joy as a starting point for the basic recipe (proportions, tempurature, length of cooking) and then go from there with my own creation ...this allows me to be crative in the the kitchen."

books,1 of 1,5.0,Hightower tells it like it is,"Jim Hightower pulls no punches in this revealing expose of how dirty our two-party system is.  He provides example after example of how corporations have seized complete control of the government, taking power away from the citizenry.  Sure, the rich have always enjoyed certain privelges that the rest of us don't.  But in the last twenty years, there has been a growing, unbridled greed that is destroying the lives of millions for the benefit of a handful of modern-day robber barons.  The vast majority of Democrats and Republicans have been bought and paid for by these insulated tycoons -- ever wonder about rich guys and corporations who give the maximum contribution to the Democrat and the Republican in the same race?  You can bet that it ain't civic pride.  If you are tired of working two jobs, and never getting ahead, this book will explain the truth about what is happening"
books,4 of 5,5.0,exquisite prose,Shirley Hazzard writes beautifully choreographed stories that gently and carefully blossom like a flower. It isn't a book for everyone because it is definitely controlled in how it reveals itself and for some it initially may feel slow. If you do stick with it Hazzard will present some pearls of writing. She writes what might be on the surface very simple stories but her real knack lays in creating some of the most lush and acute metaphors and analogies about the human condition I have ever run across. I found myself writing down sentences and turns of phrases that were tossed off a bit lightly but hit the spot. I came across her work when reading an interview that had been done with her and it gave a keen glimpse into her writing as I was reading the book. This book in particular made me think of Carson McCullers and Truman Capote in the sense that they too wrote calculated stories that only the reader in as much as they thought was reasonable at a given time. Not everything is given away on the page but you can always feel how complex the emotions of the characters are. Fantastic book
books,5 of 9,5.0,"Men are from women, not Mars","This is the book I've been looking for. It explains the world we're living in right now. And where we've been. This book really gets to the root of the basic problem: men arn't able to be men because we're afraid of our femininity. So we're half-men, and we're so [angry] at being half-men that we take it out on women. We blame them for it. That's it in a nutshell. And it all started thousands of years ago, with the agricultural revolution, when we lost our place in society. We were out of a job. And we've been playing catch-up ever since. And still are today: it's still going on. NOTE: I'm writing this on the 10th day of the insane war we're waging on Iraq. After reading this book, you'll understand why these insecure, infantile itiots mask their impotence by waging war. We are at this moment witnessing the catastrophic consequences of the hyper-masculinity that he talks about. As long as we define man as ""not-a-woman,"" we're [stuck."
books,,4.0,Great Book,"I work for a professional sports franchise (but not baseball), and this book really helped me understand the issues surrounding a professional team. This covers some major subjects, such as labor agreements, stadium financing, and broadcasting deals, by using major league baseball as an example.

You can't put this book down for minute. So  much research in the details of this horrible crime,from the family to David's Co workers to everyone around the both of them.  Paul Larosa is an incredible author and can't wait to read his next book. This book is a must read"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Great Read,"The mystery of why every single Carl Hiaasen book hasn't been made into a movie has finally been solved.  Suffice it to say that Mr. Hiaasen should be allowed to slap Demi Moore until her head falls off, and his readers should have the right to go Skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was ""Strip Tease"" the movie."
books,10 of 11,5.0,Excellent Resource,"I bought the book on CD, listened to it, and immediately listened to it a second time.  It contains invaluable information for self-help, business and/or leadership development.  Practical examples that stress the importance of being earnest with yourself and in your day to day discussions.  I assumed from the title this was a book about confrontation - it was not, it was about encouraging (and accepting) honesty and constructive feedback in all your human contact."
books,3 of 3,4.0,A very human biography of a great patriot,"This book isn't really for legal scholars, serious historians or those interested in Adams' writings. It is, however, a very well written personal biography of a great figure in American history with a special emphasis on trying to understand the hows and whys of Adams, how he responded to criticism, how he came to conclusions, why he made the decisions he came to etc...It is difficult to provide enough color sometimes when presenting such a 'long' life and McCullough I am sure had difficulty deciding when to slow the narrative to dwell on important events when there were so many to choose from. All and all, a very solid, thoughtful mainstream work."

I also agree with the lack of free time and the toll that working longer is having on our mental and physical health.

But if considered in the context of the time period when he wrote it and what it did for the study of the American Revolution, this book was the beginning of the current dominate thought on the Revolution.  Bailyn changed the way historians and Americans look at the Revolution by challenging the work of several scholars.

My question is: Why isn't this on the shelves of every bookstore and why isn't it being promoted by the &quot;natural/health&quot; food stores? Is the publisher not promoting this as it should be? It is a great resource for everyone, as disease prevention and as a diet, as well as historical information. It is a shame, in my opinion, that more people will not have the opportunity to read and learn from it merely because it is not being promoted as it deserves to be.

In sixteen chapters with names like ""Leninists of the Right,"" ""A Counter-Intelligentsia,"" and ""Strange Lie,"" the 378-page mea culpa names many familiar right-wing names, enumerating the wicked behavior of Brock's erstwhile politically ""conservative"" accomplices. His public soul searching caused me to free associate Brock's with a similar fascinating memoir published in Poland by Otto von Hoess in 1947. von Hoess similarly asked his readers for understanding and sought redemption for his wrongdoing -- after the fact. Because of its striking similarity, I'll later get back to the nearly 60 year old mea culpa."

books,1 of 1,4.0,Bizarre. Weird.  Triumphant.,How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.

The pages are soft &amp; are not hard to break in at all. I have many bibles and the pages are either torn or creased. But, these pages are one of a kind.

Thompson's description of the flight portions of Apollo 14 is derived almost exclusively from Barbree and Benedict's unreliable ""Moonshot"" and, consequently, bears only a passing resemblance to reality.  The critical events related to the abort switch and landing radar simply did not happen as described.  In my work on the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, I have always found it useful  to check astronaut memories against other sources.  I can only wish that Thompson had exercised such care"

Jim Hightower gives you real news in his book.  Why waste money on your local paper when it consists of nothing but corporate press releases?  This book shows how publicly financed elections cost less than the favors and giveaways your politicians provide to big campaign contributors. This book is fun to read, too, in spite of the serious content, and would be a great gift for family and friends, both left and right wingers"

Accused of cowardice in a now scandalized department, a now disenfranchised and disillusioned Web London sets down a path to clear his name that at a point branches off into 3 separate stories before converging back into one in a highly dramatic and well written novel.

books,1 of 1,2.0,"Skip it, its just fluff","Don't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there. This book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases. I guess it lives up to its subtitle of ""Life as a Forensic Anthropologist"" in that she usually presents only HER part in each case with little presentation of the entire case. The forensic cases are not really the star of this book, the author is. I was frustrated with the lack of depth. Instead, read ""The Body Farm"" by Bill Bass. Excellent storytelling there! He gives you personal stories, but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated"

books,1 of 1,4.0,The Tragicomedy,"Waiting for Godot was dubbed a ""tragicomedy"" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play.  The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work.  However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you.  Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be.  Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own.  What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality.  Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous.  Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale.  Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold.  A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor"

books,1 of 1,5.0,more refreshing thoughts for a thirsty life,"This book continually gives me encouragement and motivation.  It helps to point out all the good things in life without having to go shopping or changing anything in my life but the way I see things.  I enjoy this book very much and recommend it to anyone looking for inspiration and validation.  The author highlights all the wonderful things in a woman's life, and literally celebrates the fact that we merely exist.  She helps with her terrific sense of humor, and her ability to admit her faults that are not unlike our own.  She reminds us of positive things we have that we may miss in the day-to-dayness of our lives"
books,3 of 14,2.0,Great Expectations a Great Dissapointment,"Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read ""A Christmas Carol"" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens"
books,4 of 7,1.0,Ridiculous book,"Everyone loves Rose, the first narrator of this story and the central character in the book.  Her mother loves her, her first husband, Sister Evangeline, her best friend, her second husband, and her daughter.  The only people with any real reason to love this woman are her mother and daughter, both of whome she abandons completely to work as a cook in an unwed mother's home for almost no pay for 15 years without a vacation or ever having dinner at home alone with her family.  She is completely unlovable in that the only feeling she ever expresses is toward her mother.  She says she misses her everyday.  So why does she never go back to see her before she dies?  Why does she never share with her the granddaughter that she took away from her?  Rose's idea of fun is to drive aimlessly, rent a hotel room on the coast, sit on the bed for five minutes, and drive all night to be home to the husband she doesn't love by morning.  It's idiotic.  Apparently this episode was so much fun to Rose that 15 years after it happened she relates it to her daughter as oh yes, it was so much fun.  Sounds like a blast.  She can't even carry on a conversation, much less show any tenderness or affection.  It makes the people around her who love her so much seem ridiculous.  Son can barely stand to go into the kitchen at St. Elizabeth's after she leaves because he misses her so much, even though she never considered his feelings at all when she named her child Cecelia against his wishes because it held such a painful memory for him, and when she left him to go live by herself in the small cottage.  Also Sister Evangeline confides in Cecelia that she misses Rose so much she can hardly bear it.  Why?  She was a humorless, inconsiderate (to put it mildly), cold-hearted bore.  Cecelia is the only one totally frustrated by her mother, as she should be, but even she accepts her behavior in the end.  It was a well written book that you thought might lead somewhere but went absolutely nowhere, like Rose.  When she leaves you wonder what new relationships is she striking up that she could not care less about now?  I won't read Bel Canto or the Magician's Assistant.  This book was foolish in the extreme and completely pointless"
books,,5.0,An Awesome History Lesson,"An awesome history lesson, especially for those who have forgotten what it takes to defeat evil in the world. I hesitantly started reading this book expecting some blowhard general to gloat about his limited accomplishments in the big war. I had a very pleasant surprise and was drawn into another perspective of what we did as a nation to defeat Hitler and his cronies. The title is taken from a line in the Cadet's Prayer from West Point. It is a prayer we all could use to recite occasionally. I very highly recommend this book"

There are very few examples for Business Explorer. But however, I think if you play with the GUI this problem is overcome easily. THIS BOOK IS WORTH IT !!"
books,,4.0,A curious and lovely book,"In the US, we understand sexy but we struggle with the erotic.  We read the body like we read the newspaper, by habit; with a glance.  Our real failure in love is our failure to take our time.  It's not in our nature to wait, to sample, to savor.  We rush into love as if we were late to an appointment.  Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his MEMORIES OF MY MELANCHOLY WHORES doesn't rush.  The book is a seduction and moves at that quiet lazy confident pace. The protagonist turns 90 and, mindful of his mortality, wants what he's never had: ""A night of wild love with an adolescent virgin."" Of course, desire is a dream and dreams are an attempt to remember. And, what do we want to remember, everything, everyone we've ever loved.  Memory, though, is an admission of loss.  Desire is our straegy to reclaim what was lost.  Of course, memory  is a trickster...and that's part of the joy of this book, as the ""Professor,""  defies death less through contact with flesh, than though memory and desire.  In this book as in life, it is the approach, it is anticipation, that sets us on fire"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Bringing the Dead to Light,I saw this reviewed in the paper and bought it mainly because I enjoy local history.  Upon reading it I was very impressed with Bell's work.  He creates a nice balance between the events and his pursuit of the facts behind the events.  He gives informative  backgrounds on everything from the rural RI communities to TB.  The book also acts as a Folklore 101 course.  A very enjoyable read

books,5 of 11,4.0,Too much preaching and mostly cliched alternatives,"Basically an interesting, revealing if not alarming book, with loads of data, some striking graphs, and several silly cartoons. The authors have a ""bullet point"" approach to the topic, with short chapters (30 chapters in 247 pages) and multiple headings within each chapter. The data themselves are quite compelling, even if the writing style is not."

books,10 of 11,5.0,A Journey Unfulfilled,"Tolstoy's Confession was written during his time of deep internal spiritual struggle.  Upon his renunciation of a life of aristocratic wealth and worldly pleasure, Tolstoy longed for the sense of true peace that he saw in the peasant class.  Thus he embarked upon a search for meaning and happiness through a life of simple faith, manual labor, and poverty.  He formulated his own Chrisian philosophy based on Christ's Sermon on the Mount stressing the existence of the Kingdom of God within the human heart, civil disobedience, and total pacifism.  This &quot;law of love&quot; is explored deeply in confessional form throughout this autobiographical work.  Although this particular approach to living the life in Christ ultimately did not cultivate in Tolstoy the deep inner peace that he yearned for, I feel that many of his ideas can be beneficial to people both within the Church as well as not.  Regardless of the validity of his doctrine, it cannot be denied that this is an authentic, genuine, and very human confession of a man searching for God and some meaning to life on earth.  Although I personally disagree with many of Tolstoy's points, I still hold his Confession to be a universal work that deserves a fair exploration by all who have ever felt a similar need for inner peace and true reconciliation with God"

books,24 of 24,4.0,Excellent for playing songs from JCS,"The songs included in this book are Heaven on Their Minds, Everything's Alright, Hosanna, Pilate's Dream, Last Supper, Gethsemane, King Herod's Song, and Superstar.  A few things should be noted:  Firstly, Heaven on their Minds does not include the &quot;all gone sour&quot; last four verses that are used in live productions of jcs.  Instead the song is written to fade away.  That might present a problem to people performing or using that song for an audition.  The last supper only includes the chorus that the apostles sing.  Superstar is tuned to a C instead of the original E that is on all of the recordings and live productions.  Other than that, all the other keys are the same as you might hear them on cd recordings, 1973 movie, and live productions.  Chords are also included for guitar players"

books,1 of 1,5.0,I'm a big fan of the style and the central ideas of this book,"Surowiecki is a talented writer and one, who along with ""Blink"" author Malcom Gladwell, utilizes a writing style that includes myriad interesting scientific studies and historical anecdotes.  He starts off with a fascinating story about some fair, at which he witnesses hundreds of people guessing the weight of a cow.  No one got the exact weight of the cow, but the average guesses from everyone in the crowd was right on the money.  This may seem like a coincidence, but Suroweicki goes on to describe many cases where the many come to astonishing conclusions, that the few could rarely come to."

Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party."
books,5 of 9,5.0,A Primer on Iraq,"I saw Dr. Polk on C-SPAN a month or two ago.  He was addressing a gathering of concerned and apparently well-heeled citizens in the New York Museum of Art--as I recall.  He had the crowd and the moderator in the palm of his hands.  I found him to be a compelling speaker who obviously was very versed in the subject matter of Iraq.  He seemed to genuinely care about the Iraqi people--and the Amercian people.  His speech and this book was about correcting our ""present march of folly""--to steal from Barbara Tuchman's fine book title."
books,1 of 1,1.0,Don't buy this book!,"If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS"

books,3 of 3,5.0,"Outstanding Cultural History (And It's Funny, Too)","The title ""A Futile and Stupid Gesture"" is, of course a quote from ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", one of the most beloved, successful, and influential films of the past 30 years.  Doug Kenney helped write that movie and played the role of ""Stork"", as well as writing the almost-as-adored ""Caddyshack"", along with being one of the first and most powerful editors of the legendary magazine ""National Lampoon"".  Josh Karp's book is both a biography of Kenney and a history of the whole ""Lampoon"" scene, which because of the sway of the quasi-spinoff ""Saturday Night Live"", becomes a social history of American comedy during the 1970's.  And that decade was to comedy like the 1960's was to rock--a time which transformed show business and culture not just in the U.S. but in the whole Western world.  The irony is that, as a woman who worked with the almost all-male writers of that scene said of them, ""they were the most miserable bunch of guys I've ever known."""
books,1 of 1,4.0,fun + challenging wins the race,It took me a while to learn to play any of these songs on my guitar... and they sound awesome... It was one of my dreams to play songs such as &quot;One Song Glory&quot; and others. My dreams it to be Rojer in the broadway play for rent... and this is getting me evercloser to my dream. The music is challenging and quite long. Also once you learn the song on one instrument it sounds sort of strange... but if you have other people playing with you and a singer It sounds exactly like the show... This book is awesome.. definately worth the money! SO BUY IT

books,,5.0,Raymond Shaw,"A fan of Koontz since I read Dragon Tears back in 1993, I would often allow my mom to check out audio versions of his other books for me to read from the library. I have not, as yet, encountered a Koontz book that I didn't like. Even the Taking, which I can admit wasn't necessarily one of Koontz's best works, is one that, when finances permit, I will probably add to my listening library. However, I have to say that one of his best works was probably False Memory."

books,1 of 2,1.0,No escape,"Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself."
books,2 of 4,5.0,Excellent tips to improve yourself,"This book is a classic just like Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich.  The idea is basic and simple; you have to think and believe in yourself to be succesful.

As stated in this book action cures fear. So, If you fear something then do something, and the fear is gone..."
books,1 of 1,1.0,Giving Up on Steel,"Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her ""style"" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, ""telling"" not ""showing"" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice"

books,1 of 1,5.0,Friend of Man,"I discovered Paine about five years ago, and just the knowledge that a man like him lived was very uplifting to me. If only American schools would teach more of Paine. A true friend of man and one who truly understood what society needs, if all men -- and especially their leaders -- thought like Thomas Paine, our world would be farther, much farther ahead -- not in mere ""progress,"" but in true, meaningful betterment -- and would be as close to ""heaven"" as one could imagine."

books,,5.0,Read it,"Dawkins does not attack anyone, but notes that Carl Sagan and many other recent scientists made a grave error in attempting to reconcile religious beliefs with scientific facts. When religion held the upper hand, the resolution was to force people like Galileo to renounce their works. Science has held the upper hand, but too many scientists are on government payrolls or dependent upon grants to conduct meaningful research, and they must bow to forces imposing political correctness at universities to maintain their tenure or other sinecures."
books,2 of 3,5.0,An excellent slice of history,"While the pro-zionist lobby (I know them well, being a Sabra) will attempt to shred any book that doesn't present Israel as an angel and the Arab world as devils, this is a fair book and will fill a good chunk of the white space in anyone's knowledge of the region. The author attempts to explain how one founding principle determined the behavior of Israel's dominant leaders over the decades, and he succeeds. The author's conclusion is that Jabotinsky had a workable and realistic theory (build the figurative iron wall, then negotiate for peace), but that many of Israel's leaders did not have the qualities necessary to complete the second part of that theory. The author does a good job of examining these leaders, delving into what made them tick and how that affected policy. Rabin was one leader who might have made Jabotinsky's theory work, as the author shows, but he did not survive the Jewish right wing"

books,,5.0,Discover the Secrets for Your Self and Your Life,A highly recommended book.
books,2 of 3,5.0,Highly Recommended,"Ralph Keyes' books about writing have helped pull my ambition out of a tail-spin twice. His first, The Courage To Write, helped me finish my first novel, which eventually got published. The follow-up to that, The Writer's Book Of Hope, helped me get started on my fourth book, at a point when I was beginning to feel frustrated with both the business of writing and the relentlessly demanding craft of it. What Keyes does in this book and in the first is to map out the tricky and sometimes dangerous emotional landscape of writing, and he does it by giving us examples and anecdotes from famous and sometimes legendary writers who've had similar frustrations. Better than practically any book on writing out there, The Writer's Book Of Hope offers those of us who spend our days in front of typewriters and computers making up worlds with words the boost we need to carry on. And Keyes does this not with some sugar-coated inspirational messages, but with honest, realistic and historical examinations of the traditional difficulties that all writers, regardless of their fame or lack or it, face  and how they have coped and kept writing. Highly recommended"

I'm a few years younger; the Dodgers were already in Hollywood and I rooted for the hated Jankees.  But the images of this beautiful memoir were so resonant with my childhood, from soothing sound of Red Barber's voice coming from the tinny transistor radio to the edicts from the diocese of Rockville Centre, read periodically in lieu of a Sunday sermon, mostly asking for more money."

It gives some good basic information about the benefits of flax oil, such as getting the essential fatty acids to maintain optimum health. Flax oil is one of the best oils to ingest daily, it also helps to lower cholesterol, help with heart disease and numerous other benefits, too many to mention here. The recipes include such things as Middle Eastern Bean Dip, Barlean Butter, Fresh Fruit Breakfast Muesli, Creamy Garlic Dressing and over 95 more recipes. The book is ""a good price"" and is a gem in my opinion"

books,15 of 17,5.0,Don't let one bad review turn you away,"I am the author of this book. I don't recieve any royalties for its sales and I no longer work for Prevention Magazine or Rodale Inc. I've checked here from time to time to see if the reviews change. The single negative review on top has been up for YEARS. I think it's too bad. I know many people have thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it very very helpful. It's true that much of it is a compilation of many years of articles written for Prevention and for my Newsletter. But they were well researched, facthecked and contain lots of helpful info for all levels of walkers. The section on Dynamic Walking is one of kind. You won't find that information anywhere else. I think it's a shame that one bad review by a person who seems mostly interested in marathons can be in place for years and put people off from getting a book that could really motivate them to walk for health for a lifetime. If you're new to walking and or a beginner looking for solid advice and inspiration, this book won't disappoint you.  There, I've said my peace. Now MY two-bits will be up here for years. My friends will probably tease the heck out of me for defending my work. So be it! :-"
books,1 of 12,2.0,Not well written,"I've heard good things about this book so I was honestly expecting to like it.  However I really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive.  And because it was written by Brooke Shields, the book sold.  But really, if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere."
books,1 of 1,5.0,"A gem, fact filled history, written beautifully","As a resident of Mexico City, who has studied its history, La Capital by Jonathan Kandell is the finest example of what a history  book can be. It reads like a page-turner mystery and the publisher should hang their head in shame that the book has not been reprinted. I'll run out today and buy whatever copies are left in Mexico, to give as gifts in the future"
books,2 of 2,5.0,great book,"Well, Amazon invited me to write a review about this book."
books,10 of 10,5.0,Excellent Followup!,"If you've read The Warrior Elite, you know what you'll get in this book.  Captain Couch does a great job describing what happens from the day the BUD/s graduates are secure from Coronado to the time they go on forward deployment with their SEAL Platoons.  I especially liked that he offered details on both the Officer and Enlisted sides of things.  As a person hoping to secure an Officer billet to BUD/s while maintaining a family, it was refreshing to see that others do it.  It also does justice to the modern SEAL and inadvertently dispels negative notions that the likes of Marchinko and Carracci have impressed on us.  The modern SEAL is above all a Professional, like most of his processors, not a blood thirsty Rambo like the previously mentioned would have you believe.  If you want to truly understand this world, read this book, if not go back to Rouge Warrior.  It's pretty detailed and has a few pictures just like the last book.  On the negative side, I was left wanting more for the $25.00 hardcover price.  The 263 pages read more like 170.  It's worth the 5 stars I gave it, but I also felt it was not as complete a product as The Warrior Elite."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great quotations book. Oxford seal of quality in every page.,"There is one single reason why I've bought this book: I was looking for the best quotation dictionary available, at a low price. Every now and then I want to use a quotation in a text I write concerning to my work as a lawyer, but I never found such a book in local bookshops. My search ended when I got to this book. Have yourself a copy as soon as you can. You won't regret. I assure you that"
books,5 of 7,2.0,Not very useful,"Considering the size of the book I was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given. They are mostly one word meanings, if there is a meaning at all. Mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for. It wasn't helpful for me. I found ""The Babyname Wizard"" book A LOT more informative and helpful"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Best Leadership book I have read,I have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  I consider this book to be the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  It also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I found that as President of my congregation I was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  It was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have been impossible anyway) I found that he described President Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam).  His discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    If you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society.
books,6 of 7,5.0,Highly Reccomended!,"Despite the breathless headlines about the latest billion-dollar merger, most mergers don't work. In fact, more than half of all mergers fail, derailed by a common set of pitfalls. Companies merge without considering how they'll integrate after the deal; they don't communicate properly with their employees, and executives don't make decisions quickly enough to placate frightened workers. The executives who navigate mergers effectively are those who communicate well, deal with ambiguity and make decisions in times of instability. Author Price Pritchett offers an easily digested primer on the hazards of mergers, and lists hints for avoiding common problems. The authors provide plenty of concrete examples showing how such companies as Sony, Wells Fargo and the Chicago Sun-Times suffered from the dilemmas that accompany mergers. We ... recommend this comprehensive guide for managers on both sides of a business marriage. Caution: Read After the Merger before you merge"

books,4 of 7,4.0,An excellent work but the translation has some problems,"Thucydides' ""The History of the Peloponnesian War"" is a wonderful source for any thoughtful study of Ancient Greek History.  I'm proud to put this copy on my book shelf next to Homer, Herodotus and Catullus, all my favorite ancient writers.  Thucydides writes for what is the first time an objective historical work.  This, along with Herodotus, is the birth of History.  Yet there are a couple of troubling problems with the translation.  For one thing it is full of Cold War lingo that makes it hard not to draw connections from Athens and Sparta to the United States and the USSR.  Phrases like ""reactionary elements"" are out of place and don't mesh well with the actual Greek.  In addition the translator uses the word ""empire"" for the Greek word ""arche"".  Now my Greek isn't the best but my dictionary tells me that arche means province or territory, or literally a place that is ruled over.  Empire has a lot of strong emotions attached to it, and its not a good translation for ""arche"".  Hence the translator adds an element that Thucydides didn't intend when he uses ""Athenian Empire."" Besides those elements it's a great translation."
books,77 of 87,5.0,Cheney writes an enlightening book on American history for the masses.,"Lynee Cheney's `A Time for Freedom: What Happened When in America' is an interesting book which ensures that its readers, comprising of students and adults alike to be aware of key events that took place within its recent development from the arrival of the Pilgrims to the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. In this book, she outlines and reinforces the importance of such dates as 1492, 1607, 1620, 1776, and 1787. However, as she explains, an actual comprehension of American history cannot be explained with a presentation of dates exclusively. Thus, she places a great deal of emphasis on chronology."
books,7 of 8,5.0,A challenging and rewarding read,"John Man's Genghis Khan is a chalenging and rewarding read.  It will come as a bit of a jolt to readers used to reading popular biographies of more modern figures.  This is a very different experience to reading about, say, Churchill or Kennedy.  More modern subjects have a wealth of source material available to the historian, whose task becomes one of selection and condensation.  Not so for a 13th century leader whose life was often deliberately shrowded in secrecy.  Man's task is not to wade through volumes of material, but to actually find material.  And he does a terrific job."
books,,5.0,"Hands down, the best legal thriller I ever read!","How do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you've ever read?  This was a well-paced, highly entertaining story, but the book's real success is its longevity.  You continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it.  Hands down, this is Connelly's best novel.  Few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end.  Mick Haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works.  To him, it's a machine, and he's the ""greasy angel"" who keeps it well oiled.  Even though Haller's cynicism is a constant source of amusement, his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence.  Then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client, who can pay top dollar.  Accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman, Louis Roulet hires his services.  What first seems to be a straight forward case, will ultimately test Haller to his limits: his family will be threatened, he will be accused of a crime, and someone very close to him will die.  Not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system, the writing is first-rate."

The book tells of changing our attitudes by the way we think. Norman writes that by thinking positive thoughts we draw in positive results and in the same way we draw in negative results by thinking negative thoughts.

books,11 of 16,2.0,An OK Memoir At Best,"I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Novel,"I just reread this book for the second time.  I haven't read it since it came out a few years ago.  I enjoyed it this time around as much as I did the first time.  The book has everything, mystery, romance, humor, and sadness.  It's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end.  The main plot is around Callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on TV.  She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant.  After some investigating and tests, Suzanne is proved correct.  But a baby stealing/selling scheme is uncovered in the process.  Callie is determined to get to the bottom of it.  While that is going on she has to deal with her ex-husband Jake being brought in on her dig, he's an anthropologist. I don't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed, reconciled and explored.  Callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval.  It is a wonderful love story and mystery.  I think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction"

It's one of King's best restrained writings, with no stomch turning descriptions of blood and gore and very little off the wall, meaningless intrusion of aliens which characterize some of his other novels (Dreamcatcher, Regulators etc.)  The only thing off-putting was the extremely poor diction of William Hurt.  He routinely pronounced t's and d's as ""tha,"" which may come across as laid back in a movie role, but in a reading sounds just plain sloppy. I would have given it five stars except for Hurt. I sincerely hope he is not used in readings again, at least until he receives some speech therapy."
books,1 of 6,5.0,Identifies four major categories of knowledge workers & provides a format for matching each category with management strategies,Knowledge workers are innovators and often driving forces of a company's product line and services: they are IT specialists and planners and you rely on them in your business: but are they delivering as much as they can? Knowledge management expert Thomas Davenport argues many companies don't maximize their productivity because they apply rigid management formulas to their workforce. His Thinking For A Living: How To Get Better Performance And Results From Knowledge Workers identifies four major categories of knowledge workers and provides a format for matching each category with management strategies which encourage optimum performance.
books,0 of 2,5.0,The Best Work of Wells,"""The Martians have arrived. Let the war begin."" A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction ""The War of the Worlds"". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,""The War of the Worlds"" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good."
books,3 of 3,1.0,"Boring, boring","After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no."
books,1 of 1,4.0,I wish he had more info on the cartoon characters,Personaly I find them more interesting and there seems to be more demand for that type of animation in movies and ads.
books,9 of 9,5.0,Truly great book--with a minor caveat,"This is history as history should be written.  By turns witty, incisive, and far reaching, Heather draws on his broad reservoirs of knowledge of not only of the Barbarians and Rome, but also of modern one-party states and economics--surprisingly relevant topics.  I very much appreciated how Heather gave context to the motivations of the sources he quoted, taking nothing at face value and wittily translating the sense of old quotes so that the modern reader could understand them."
books,2 of 4,5.0,Spiritual Food,"This book fed me richly for a period of two years, and I am not easy to please"
books,10 of 13,5.0,homage to hiv,"Shilts' great book shows us how much of the AIDS related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided. The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not."
books,,5.0,freaks and fear and the breaking of formula,"Here is the ninth volume in Lemony Snicket's bestselling children's collection A Series of Unfortunate Events. The Baudelaire orphans had hidden in the trunk of Count Olaf's car at the end of The Hostile Hospital to escape from a fire that Olaf and his ""associates"" had set. With The Carnivorous Carnival They arrive at the Caligari Carnival out in the middle of the hinterlands and are able to get out of the trunk before Count Olaf discovers them. Klaus, Violet, and Sunny disguise themselves as Carnival Freaks so that they can stay at the Carnival and have the opportunity to discover some facts about the possibility of one of their parents still living and the rest of the ""Snicket File"". Klaus and Violet are disguised as a Two-Headed Freak Beverly / Eliot, Sunny is Chabo the Wolf Baby. They join with other freaks, like Kevin the Ambidextrous Man, Colette the Contortionist, and Hugo the Hunchback."
books,,4.0,You'll need no help staying awake for this one,"Right from the beginning I found myself hooked on this story as I followed the main characters, Ed Harris and Tom Bullock, in their quest to make sense of their ""discovery"". My curiosity only grew as I turned each page and I soon raced to the end. The author keeps a fast pace with little clutter; giving just enough information to keep you asking questions. Definitely a good read"
books,2 of 2,4.0,It's a gotta have,"I absolutely loved this novel. I usually read L.A. Banks Vampire Huntress series but I decided in a slight change of pace and boy did I get it. The story is about a woman trying to run away from her tragic past, with her child gone from a freak accident Angela doesn't know how to bounce back. After advice from a friend she decides to pick up the pieces from its point of origin, her grandmother's old house."
books,4 of 4,5.0,Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book,"I purchased this book for my class, and I was not disappointed. I knew very little about Photoshop when I started my online class, and I felt that this book was very helpful and answered pretty much all my beginner-Photoshop user questions. I would recommend this book for people who want to learn the basics about using Photoshop"
books,4 of 4,4.0,Bogle is Required Reading,"Bogle, Bob Brinker, and Jane Bryant Quinn sold me on the idea of index funds. There are some who believe you need to stick to actively managed funds to, as one money manager told me, ""be there to steer the plane away from the mountain at the last minute."" Hogwash, especially when you consider a lot of blend funds have 95 percent the same allocations as comparable index funds, only you pay the higher expense ratios."
books,6 of 6,5.0,Ulysses springs eternal and from every corner,"I liked this book immensely on several levels.  As an anthropologist, I found it very interesting to get a Padaung's eye view, written in literate English, of his own background, his childhood in the remote, forested mountains of eastern Burma.  The author tells of everything---from the strictures of Roman Catholic missionaries in far parts of Asia, to eating dogs, baby wasps, and snakes (with relish), his grandmother's stories, guardian spirits, a Padaung funeral.  The Burmese political climate of the 1960s and `70s merely lurks in the background until the author drops out of a seminary and heads to Mandalay to attend university.  While information about various remote peoples is not uncommon, it is usually processed by foreign writers who have visited them.  FLGG gives it to you from the horse's mouth."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Shocking and Surprising!,"In his book Bruce Bawer outlines the negative impact of immigration policies in Western Europe. Essentially Bawer points out that instead of encouraging integration, Western Europe focuses on multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is the idea that new cultures maintain a separate identity, even though immigrants have taken up residence in a new nation (ideally multiculturalism is acceptance of all cultures; but that is rarely seen in reality)."
books,3 of 3,4.0,Impressive Story Especially After 60 Years,"I think Terry Frei did a fantastic recounting events of something that happened 60 years ago.  Clearly Mr. Frei did a thorough job researching all the events and the many characters he references.  As for the reader, he/she is taken on a journey about teenagers turning into young men during one of the most difficult times in American history.  Frei goes into great detail about the Wisconsin Badger roster and characters that make it up.  At times, it does get confusing but I honestly don't see how Frei could have singled anyone out -- except for perhaps Dave Schreiner.  I will admit I skipped some of the middle of book when the author gives a recap of all the Badger games from 1942.  The second half of the book (about the war) is very well done.  In fact, the second half of the book is a real page tuner.  All in all, it is a good book about some fine people that I would have loved to have met."
books,,5.0,A Modern Classic!,"It's always fun to read a best seller from almost 20 years ago, especially one that was proclaimed as something of a classic at the time.  It's even more enjoyable to discover that Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities proves worthy of its acclaim even with the absence of cell phones, email and instant messaging."
books,9 of 10,4.0,Mr. Verne's Best.,"Note to all first time readers. This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick. Mr. Verne's book deserves the appelation, ""far ahead of its time."""
books,14 of 32,2.0,Bemoaning the triumph of individualism,"The authors of this book are concerned. Americans aren't doing what they should.  Specifically, to paraphrase former president Bill Clinton, they're not spending their money right.  They value things they shouldn't.  They work too much.  They own too much.  They shop at evil big box stores like Wal-Mart.  So, with paternalistic concern in their hearts, they have written this book to warn us that we're in need of a correction."
books,71 of 71,5.0,This is an important book,"For several years I've been told by friends that I ought to lay hands on a copy of this book, before it goes out of print. When I finally found one and spent an evening reading it, I discovered why there is such a buzz about the book."
books,,5.0,A great guide for the spiritual journey,"This guide to prayer is just one more in the continuing line of beneficial products offered by Upper Room Publishing.  Many people look for ways to deepen their time spent in spiritual growth and development.  Too often we focus so heavily on ourselves that we forget the contributions of the past.  The guide to prayer series offers insights that have been gleened from the spiritual practices of the church throughout the centuries.  The format is simple and concise taking the reader on a journey of daily worship including invocational prayer, spiritual readings, scripture, meditation, prayers, hymns, journaling, and benediction.  The readings for reflection pull in the insight of spiritual leaders both past and present and take on both a theological and inspirational tone.  This particular version is adapted for use by pastor's and laymen alike.  Upper Room is to be commended for this work.  It is a must have for all persons who long to deepen the spiritually formative moments of their day"
books,,5.0,Brilliant writing and a great action-packed story,"The one caveat about reading a James Rollins book is that it takes patience to get through it. The storyline is usually a multi-threaded complexity that sweeps you from one country, in one chapter, to the other side of the world, in the next chapter; and pulls you into a fascinating plot that blends historical fact with science fiction."
books,,5.0,Wonderful!!,Even if you do not read historic novels you will love this one. The author lets you see inside the characters so it is history book that is nothing like the ones you read in school
books,1 of 1,5.0,Very satisfying read,"Love Silva's characters and plots. Only wish is for more, more, more"
books,11 of 20,5.0,Innoculate yourself against the hate of the left,"The hate here is the hate that the Left seems to have not only for American, but the notion of Western Civilization in general.  In the immortal words of a bunch of Stanford Leftists: ""Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho!  Western Civ has got to go!""  It is interesting that the left continually rails against Western Civilivation and Christianity, yet these are the very societies that have created the unprecedented freedoms to attack them from within.  Something the Left tries to skirt around at all costs."
books,4 of 5,5.0,Good Book,"This book is full of information on all kinds of different dog breeds. It tells you if the breed is good with kids, how much it sheds, what it is good at, and more"
books,3 of 3,5.0,The Best Play of the 20th Century,"Samuel Beckett's play seems to endlessly perplex reviewers: they want to see in it concrete associations that it generally denies them. Is Godot God? Are Didi and Gogo heroes for their seemingly indefatiguable faith he will arrive, or fools for hinging all their hopes and dreams on a man who never seems to arrive to help alleviate their suffering?"
books,,5.0,Chinese Lessons: Five Classmates and the Story of the New China,"A five star book.  To most westerners, China is a huge enigma and this book sheds light on what is happening in China today.  Most westerners have some idea of the horrors of the cultural revolution but may not understand how it permeated the lives of most of the educated Chinese.  This book tells those stories and how these five classmates of his have fared,and about how new China works today. His personal story is also very interesting"
books,6 of 6,5.0,Life changing,"Over the past few days I have been slowly reading each page of Bill Plotkin's pivotal work Soulcraft. I had read it a few months before I completed a vision quest with the non-profit he founded in 1980, www.animas.org, but it was a completely different book then. Now, having experienced the profundity of his Western based soul initiation process in the form of a Animas Valley Vision Quest,  I have revisited his life's work and boy is it GOOD! No, GREAT! No, OUTSTANDING!"

books,,5.0,EXCELLENT WALKING BOOK - A must read!!!,"This is an excellent walking book because it is so informative and motivational! It provides oodles of information about what shoes to wear, what gear to wear, winterize your walking program, how to walk off your weight, a routine for the road, how to prepare for a 5-K or a marathon, and dynamic walking routines...and everything else you need to know.  I highly recommend this book to the beginner or advanced walker.  This book has inspired me to walk three (3) 5Ks in the past four months and I now walk on a daily basis!  Just buy it and read -- you'll like it! =-"
books,,4.0,Wrong CD inside,Fast shipping and great shape. The only problem we had was that the cd inside the book was for indesign instead of photoshop
books,7 of 8,5.0,Any Mundis book makes an excellent gift for the financially insecure.,"And make no mistake, you can make zilch or millions each year, and still get finances and everything related to them hopelessly, destructively wrong. All it takes to accomplish that is ignorance, a self destruct wish, or even just simple mismanagement of everyday debt. Aside from the ilk of Bill Gates, almost nobody in America is financially independent and self sufficient. We live trapped in a ""Gotta Have it NOW"" mentality and credit is our crack pipe."
books,36 of 71,5.0,Morris hits another home run with this superb effort!,"What makes this and other similar works by Israel's ""new"" historians significant is that they are coming around to what academics in Europe and some even in America have known for decades, that Israel forced the majority of Palestinians out of Israel through the use of terrorism, mass murder, and forced expulsions.  Morris has joined the growing number of Israelis and Jewish Americans who are coming out and looking at Israel's past without rose colored glasses and this is, of course, angering Israel's supporters who hold to such laughable notions that the Arabs left of their own accord or were instructed to leave by other Arab leaders for some reason that remains mysterious.  One might as well claim that the Native Americans moved to reservations because they wanted a change of scenery.  The criticism aimed at this book is part of the usual obfuscation process to make it seem as if ""there are two truths"" or that Morris and the multitude of Israeli historians like him are all prone to hyperbole.""  This is nonsensical to say the least.  Neutral academics who aren't involved in this conflict and Israeli Jews such as Morris receive nothing but constant ""criticism"" for revealing the truth about this conflict to wider audiences in Israel and America (the Europeans and others in the world don't require ""new"" or ""revisionist"" history as they have been aware of the Palestinian refugee problem and what caused it since it happened).  The declassified information found in Israeli official archives is nothing new to much of the world, but it does help those people who know very little about this conflict or have the wrong idea in Israel and the US.  Many of the critics who have attempted to ""pan"" Benny Morris' work are the same ""academics"" who support such charlatans as Joan Peters.  They don't want people to learn the obvious truth and see past the propoganda.  This is especially important here in the United States where pro-Israeli sentiments run high and blind support for that apartheid regime is unwavering.  Also, the critics don't note some of the interesting insights Morris gives such as pointing to some Israeli actions as purely military and not meant to drive out Palestinians (and thus supporting pro-Israeli views), but they still had that effect anyway.  Morris doesn't protray the Zionists as some evil army, just a well organized one that planned for and carried out an expansionist campaign designed to disenfranchise the Palestinians of their lands.  The war was fought weeks before an Arab armies even announced their intentions to ""attack"" Israel and yet strangely all the fighting took place in Palestinian designated regions.  We also get some interesting insights into the major players like David Ben-Gurion who was one of the master planners of the Zionist plot to conquer Palestine.  Morris, contrary to what some reviewers claim, is actually quite balanced and neutral and isn't as harsh towards the Israeli side as purported (he's actually a Zionist himself).  Morris is just not interested in living in some fantasyland that has been built up largely in Israel and the United States that the Arabs were all rabid anti-Jewish masses waiting to attack the Jews and that the fledgling Zionists did what they had to do to survive.  It was not survival which they sought, it was conquest and expansion.  And even many Israeli academics have arrived at what has been obvious to the rest of the world.  Highly recommended"
books,,4.0,Important Myth-Breaking Work,"Richard Middleton convincingly argues in this well written book that the influence of Pitt during the war has been hyped.  Pitt showed no system for winning the war and his descents on the French coast were political expedients to avoid sending troops to Germany.  Pitt was not Prime Minister as the office did not exist.  Instead he worked as one of two secretaries of state, who, along with the Treasury, made up the ministry.  The book focuses on the politics and administration of the war, and not on the battles and campaigns themselves.  Interestingly, the author shows how historians before the early 1900s were sloppy, and how modern historians often rely on their work without doing their own proper investigation."

books,3 of 3,5.0,Twenty years ago...,"More than twenty years ago, this book, along with a great friend from the Church played a pivotal role in helping me to turn my life around.  The book amazingly does help lift a person from the depths of despair and doubt. It's principles are easy to put into practice.  I found Zig Zigglar's style to be entertaining, great fun--he makes it easy to stay motivated and focus on the most important principles in life that seem so easily lost. SEE YOU AT THE TOP made me laugh for the first time in such a long time. Now, I am refreshing my attitude with OVER THE TOP. I got the two-tape version. That was outstanding so I got the book and I'm not disappointed. I always wanted to thank Zig somehow, and I should have found a way to do that"

Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures).

books,4 of 5,5.0,"If life is a dream, then don't wake me up","This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations ."

One fears letting the others see the true horrors of a fruitless war.  Another fears being rejected out of jealousy for powers they do not all share.  The betrayal of a hero and his death torments one mages soul.  And finally, the last mage does not want to share the memory of a violent execution.  These secrets kept them from each others minds."

books,3 of 3,5.0,A great story about football and so much more,"So many had raved about this to me, on the web and in the media I didn't know if it could live up to all of that. It was even better than I expected. The friendships, the campus atmosphere in the first year of the war, the great football season involving famous players (Crazy Legs) and a famous coach (Four Horseman), and then the war experiences! When you get to the battle climaxes, you're both feeling proud and ready to cry in places, and you're also staggered because of the amount of research that had to go into this to find all of it out. Not to ruin the story, but this also shows why a lot of us Wisconsin fans think David Schreiner should be honored on the facade of Camp Randall Stadium. If you haven't heard of Dave Schreiner, you should. Talk about what this country is all about! He's it."

books,1 of 1,5.0,The End of Iraq brilliant and informative,"One of the best books I've read on Iraq by someone with firsthand knowledge of the country, especially the Kurds, and an excellent writing style.

books,15 of 19,5.0,"Educate yourself, but use your judgement","Dr. Lawliss notes in ""The ADD Answer"" that we should not put teachers, doctors, or Dr. Lawliss himself above our parental observations and intuition.  There are some unproven methods in this book, but there is also a ton of insight on family dynamics and treating the environment of the child.  Learn from this book and then you decide how or if to apply the methods.  I have been putting teachers on a pedestal, believing they know more about child behavior.  No more of this - they know more about children in general, but I know my own child best, and being that I am willing to honest with myself and my child I can effectively use what is pertinent to our situation from this book"

I love to cook and love good food unfortunatelly like many I don't have the time, expecially with a new baby that requires my attention constantly.  This book has been great.

books,1 of 3,5.0,A great first in the trilogy!,"I really enjoyed this book from the first page. Nora Roberts just makes you feel as though you know the characters so well. It is a wonderful 3 part story of 3 sisters of the heart. It takes you through each of their lives and their evolution into the women they are today. This first book is focused on Margo, a maid's daughter. She has huge dreams and sets out to find them and make them come true. Read this book to see her set out, find and lose her self and then come full circle back to the place she started out"
books,6 of 6,5.0,Not just for Halloween,"This is a wonderful book for the creative spirit or crafty mom. Instead of spending your hard earned cash on flimsy costumes that may get only one wear, you can make your own. It includes a multitude of colorful photos and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions to make many exciting and unique costumes. Some of them include: a king, robot, knight in shining armour, magician, cowboy and hula girl. This would be a great book to use for Halloween costumes as well as for dress up and role play. Many of the costumes can be made by kids themselves. It will save you money and the kids will have a great time"
books,13 of 13,5.0,Powerful,"I just finished Think and Grow Rich for the 3rd time.  The first time I read it, I was a twenty something and didn't fully grasp it; the next time I read it, I was a forty something, and I reaped great benefits by implementing these principles into my life and career; now, I am almost sixty, and I finally  understand the book.  Napoleon Hill was clearly correct when he stated that it is very seldom that a young person can grasp the master keys to riches.  After completing this book for the third time, I am looking forward to an even more satisfying and productive future...  I highly recommend this book to those who want to find the keys to success and riches as well as peace of mind.  There should be a college curriculum built around this book.  In today's U.S. society, the concepts of self-determination and individualism are dying concepts.  This book will teach you how to use your mind to achieve anything that you desire.  Everyone desiring success and riches should read this book...  Please do not take offense to the masculine references contained in the book.  It should be remembered that this book was completed almost 70 years ago and society was ""different"".  It's principles apply to both genders and all races and ethnic groups"

books,3 of 3,2.0,don't snatch it up,"The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture."
books,3 of 4,4.0,Learning to Accept the Insanity,"Waiting for Godot, a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes, attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with--it is a call to action. This play is packed with nonsensical dialogue. The plot does not exsist. Yet, once we realized that Waiting for Godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense--at least in subtle ways. Much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality, but, that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century. It's enigmatic, a puzzle of words, poetry, and philosophy. I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. The play is short and does not take too much commitment. Take a quiet evening and give it a shot. What are you waiting for"
books,1 of 1,5.0,My first book I read  by Dean Koontz,"For me, this was one of starters of Dean Koontz's books. I really liked the book. Dean Koontz is my favorite writers, cause of him I am doing my own book. Pick this one up, really good characters, main character, really good story, and plot"
books,0 of 2,2.0,"Smug, but empty","Carter's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many Americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper-sticker-grade philosophy is just about on target.  His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Deep,"I ordered this book thinking that it would help put some things in perspective...what I got was a total eye-opener.  I have to admit, the man knows what he's talking about.  I didn't think it would be as religious as it is, but I'm deeply involved anyhow."
books,1 of 3,5.0,Here's to Bukowski,"With Bukowski there is no middle ground; you either love him or you hate him. Yes he can be filthy, jaded and downright mean. But there is the ring of truth here as well. Published posthumously this is a feast for Bukowski fans. There are a lot of dark poems here like Walking with the Dead and Return to Sender. But there is also some lighthearted stuff. In The Fool Dines Out he shows us his human side; he is the husband whose rude behavior towards a waiter brings on spousal criticism (in private of course)"
books,8 of 8,4.0,Well Worth Wading Through,"This book definitely gets a little bogged down in statistics at points.  A couple of the chapters could have been easily trimmed down by a couple paragraphs and tables (and boy are there a lot of tables).  However, I still think this book is an important contribution to the discussion of american community versus radical individualism."
books,13 of 44,1.0,What a moron!,"It is imbecilic people like Michael Ledeen who contribute to the current U.S. foreign policy which separates the ""good"" countries and the ""terrorists."" It is common knowledge that the U.S. has a habit of supporting dictatorships, terrorist movements & groups throughout its history. Yet, the U.S. and people like Ledeen have the gall to declare a battle of ""good vs. evil."" Simply, the U.S. will support a regime whether it sponsors terrorism or not, if it so suits their interests. You have the Central Asian republics for example, Central American in the '80s, Saddam & Taliban in the '80's, Israel now, the list goes on and on. So, this ""war"" against the ""terror masters,"" is a way the U.S. gov't can fool the American people into bloated military expansionism, imperialism, and a militant unilateralism that will ultimately cause its own demise. And, sorry to be the bearer of bad news but  the U.S. will NOT win for among other things, peak oil & the decline of the dollar will bring down the U.S. economy and hence military-industrialist complex very soon. In fact, the process has already begun with the Iraq war. The U.S. is no exception to the rises and falls of empires of the past, and in fact the collapse will be proportional to its size"
books,24 of 26,5.0,an absolute must,"Everyone must have this book!  In this era of managed care (managed costs), patients have to be pro-active in order to get the Quality of Care and Appropriate Treatments to ensure their health and well being.  Patients will no longer feel powerless with this book at their fingertips"

books,8 of 28,1.0,I think Ms. Hazzard owes me an apology.,"The only reason I finished ""The Transit of Venus"" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money"
books,2 of 2,4.0,Worth your time,This is a Dan Brown book but has a feel of a James Patterson book.  It is a typical scandal in politics and as it unravels it is even more scandalous.  I thought it was enjoyable and had some interesting information about space and the ocean that will give you some educational value.  I enjoyed it a lot but wouldn't classify it as a best ever
books,,5.0,another jewel,"The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series are each a jewel in their own right and this most recent addition is no different. What lies within the pages of this book is the opportunity to be transported to the main character's simple, wisdom, and curiosity filled life in Botswana. Be ready to be transported on a great mini vacation when you read this book"
books,2 of 3,2.0,Clever at best.,"This was Bukowski's last published work before he died. It's an old-fashioned detective novel, or a parody of one, and an allegory about a man getting ready to die. It's clever at best. There are some great one-liners. At worst, it's convoluted and easy. Taken in context of Bukowski's life, it's a big middle finger to all the literary elitism Bukowski despised. But as a stand-alone book, it's little more than its title suggests: pulp. Fluff. And if you're not interested in Bukowski's life, this book has little to offer."
books,1 of 1,4.0,Both interesting and important,"The author of this book outlines the history of the theory of risk in the last 450 years and its modern metamorphosis into risk management. The reading is fascinating, giving many historical tales and anecdotes that one could only obtain from time-consuming consultation of many different documents or books. The author confuses skepticism with cynicism at times, especially when discussing the relation between modern financial engineering and risk management, but in general the dialog is pleasant to read, and offers many different insights into the different viewpoints of risk. This is especially true for the discussion of 'prospect theory' as first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky and its elaboration of risk averse behavior. Readers sympathetic with prospect theory will find its inclusion refreshing, although it would have been even more helpful to such a reader to find a discussion of the relation between prospect theory and its expression, if any, in modern risk management."

books,8 of 9,5.0,A woman to woman look at life,"This book, at first looks like a book of daily wisdoms starting with January 1, but it is also actually teaching woman how to embrace themselves and their value."
books,3 of 8,5.0,learning more about our early history,I found this book well researched and full of information I knew nothing about. Taylor doesn't pull any punches when discussing our European ancestors and their brutality towards the native americans they helped destroy. Fascinating reading for anyone interested in our early history
books,4 of 5,5.0,Incredible insight into US history,"I had to read this book for my college US history class. This is the most interesting history book I have ever read. Besides making a good college text, this book would also be a fun read as it is written like good literature. True he does go on and on about how good the North American weather is, but I say this is only natural for a British Chap :) It is this incredible insight and depth that never gets bogged down that is one of the strong points of the book."
books,8 of 21,2.0,Feminists contemplate marriage,"As an avid reader, a feminist, and newly engaged to be married, I was thrilled to see that the third wave feminist grrls from &quot;Bust&quot; magazine had edited a book on marriage.   To add to my excitement it was published by the very cool Seal Press, and had a forward by my hero bell hooks.   IT WAS SEVERELY DISAPPOINTING!  Based on my previous experience, I expected honest, daring, endearing funny stories from a variety of self actualized women. Instead I got boring stories about:  how un-feminist marriage is, what last name the baby gets, and is lesbian marriage &quot;real&quot; marriage.   Clearly the editors didn't do a very good job seeking out QUALIFIED submissions - something with attitude, something where theory meets praxis.  To top it off even the forward from bell hooks was bland.  She discusses her legacy with feminism and leaves out discussing MARRIAGE!  A (good) book about feminism and marriage is despretly needed.  It's such a difficult area for all of us partnered thinking humans.  &quot;Sex and the City&quot; is doing great.  Why can't we have a book version.  And I don't think &quot;The Rules&quot; counts"
books,3 of 5,4.0,"Well written, informative book","Worth reading if you need to learn more about type, layout grids, and popular fonts of the past decade."
books,5 of 13,4.0,Schaeffer offers a thoughtful conservative perspective,"While my own convictions are not reflected in Schaeffer's books, he always presents a thoughtful challenge to those who would disagree with his positions.  This book is no exception.  For a broader view of the nature of morality, see my ""Morality: Does 'God' Make A Difference?"" where I show why and how belief in God makes a difference--for good or ill"
books,,4.0,Ok this was good,"Very clever premiss, caused me to look into the actual ""Books of the Dead"" which are simplistic yet provided the entire faith system for an ancient culture that dominates the world today. The mystery was fun to read and there were a few nice twists but as in ""The DaVinci Code"", the historical fiction far surpassed the story telling"
books,2 of 3,4.0,"Good continuation of the series, but not enough action","As a political thriller, this book was heavy on the ""political"" and not so much on the ""thriller"".  The prior two books, Term Limits and Transfer of Power were more action packed.  As a fan of the series, however, I do recommend this third book in the series.  There are a large number of characters returning from the prior two books, so I'd definitely recommend reading the series in order."
books,1 of 3,1.0,Pure Pain,"This was my first reading of a Kellerman novel, though I'd obviously heard about him for years. I can't imagine a read much more painful than this novel. He is the king of what writers call Talking Heads, just pages and pages of dialogue that go nowhere. He also loves convenience, an absolute deal killer in mystery and suspense. The characters Delaware interviews protest for a few sentences then suddenly realize they better help him. And then there are the pages and pages and pages where he and Milo have to have impossibly mundane dialogue so the author can tell you how the mystery is unfolding...because nothing in the material leads to any mystery of merit. It's also amazing that Kellerman is a psychologist and his character is one as well, and yet so often it is other characters pointing out what even amateur phsychologists or observers of human beings would know. If this is, as the jacket says, ""one of the world's most popular authors"", I need to go in search of the worst sellers."
books,3 of 8,1.0,A Psychiatric Patient's Viewpoint,"Having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years, I can assure those who swallow Breggin's nonsense hook, line and sinker that nobody could have ""talked"" me back to anything resembling ""health.""  The mental anguish I suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like Breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long.  Financial and insurance considerations aside, talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results."
books,14 of 17,5.0,Brother Tavis Smiley is the Truth,"I've always dug&Respected Tavis Smiley big time. I've always respected his Vast Knowledge&Ability to communicate&be direct&just do his thing. this Book takes you back to his upbringing. this Book pulls no punches about what he dealt with as a Young Black Man growing up in a Household of a Large family,also dealing with getting whippings(this was the Pre-Pre Time-Out Era which back in the day only applied to Sports Games)and dealing with his own self in the Process. everybody sees&Hears the Success,but not many people are aware of the struggle this Man had to endure&the many lasting images&things he had to deal with Mentally.  I applad Brother Tavis Smiley for not being afraid to settting the Record Straight.  this Book will hit you in so many ways&depending on your own upbringing it might be close to your own story. I can relate to it big time.Tavis doesn't back down to BET or NPR Either.Tavis without a doubt is one of the most Important Voices out here.  he keeps it real&this Book is very direct&real."
books,5 of 5,5.0,More Than A Guide -- A Mat-Side Companion,David Swenson offers an excellent book to support building a personal Ashtanga practice.  I have been doing Ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by David's Primary Series DVD and this book since I first began my practice.
books,,4.0,Helpful Experiences,"The book had a lot of helpful experiences and perspectives one can view in life. It broadens one's thinking and challenges us to see how we can better the quality of life that we live. References to the Bible I believe is the ""true key""."
books,8 of 12,4.0,A joy,"This is perhaps the best concise history of the United States out there.  Johnson writes beautifully, and, unlike Howard Zinn, he does not let ideology completely dominate the book.  But be prepared to spend a lot of time on this one, as it's a heavyweight"
books,2 of 3,5.0,An amazing debut!,"Golden Country is by far the best book that I have read in a long time.  Gilmore has created a large cast of compelling characters whose lives I immediately wanted to know more about.  Moreover, it is a beautifully written book.  It's hard to believe that this is a debut novel.  I look forward to her next book."
books,3 of 3,5.0,A practical and life changing guide,"Joan Borysenko's book, Inner Peace For Busy People, is an intelligently written, thought provoking read.  She has demonstrated a deep understanding of those things that create familiar feelings of being overwhelmed and stressed to the max, and better yet, she gives practical solutions on ways to cope with that stress.  The chapters in this book are short, one page or a little more.  I found that the best way to read this book was to read a chapter a week and attempt to instill these lessons gradually.  I can honestly say that it helped me to find new ways to relax and enjoy life, in spite of feeling at times as though I am ""crazy busy"" as the author discusses.  I highly recommend this book.  Unlike other self-help books, this guide doesn't overgeneralize, or have within it's pages unrealistic expectations that people would have difficulty implementing in their own lives.  I found it to be incredibly practical and life-changing.  I feel more rested and relaxed than I have in a very long time."
books,7 of 11,5.0,Great View of Rogers' Theories,"I read this book as a student in high school. I was dissatisfied with the way my education was going. Science and math were stressed and everything felt like a mold. My life lacked a human side, and I could not be myself, I had to be what my teachers wanted me to be. Reading this book helped to change all of that. Rogers shows a way to be human, rather than the machine that the scientific community stresses, but he does this in a scientific manner so it has merit within the scientific community. His theories for education are also amazing and have helped me to shape my own college education"
books,3 of 4,5.0,Truth telling at it's best,"I must say I am appalled at the negative feedback on this book, and can only deduce that these reviews are written by those of whom this book speaks!  Granted not ALL people of any ethnic race or population are bad, Dennis is simply exposing a behind the scenes multi-billion dollar business that just so happens to be run by the Gypsy culture. The stories in here are true and not fabrications. I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Marlock and listening to him speak. He is a very knowledgeable individual who has certainly done his homework and knows exactly what he is talking about. I highly doubt Mr. Marlock is making millions on this, it seems to be his passion, his life's work to get the word out there so less innocent people fall victim to such cruel crimes. The honest people work hard for their money legitimately, and no one should be allowed to just take it away. To all the scam artists out there, spend less time writing bad reviews and go get an education and a real job!"
books,2 of 2,1.0,Worst Danielle Steel Yet,I have been reading Danielle Steel since her first book was published and this is by far her worst one yet. Over the past few years her writing has deterioriated rapidly. It's almost as if she doesn't care anymore; she knows readers will buy her books no matter how poorly they're written.
books,,4.0,"Good information, much here for breeders.","This book has good information for feeding and care of African Grey Parrots.  I wish there had been more on training, however the breeding sections are excellent."
books,3 of 52,1.0,A waste of money,This book is a waste of money. I received it as a gift so I couldn't return it. It is full of historical mistakes and careless errors. It is not  worth taking the time to point them out
books,2 of 2,4.0,Best of Nora,"First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read"
books,,5.0,One of King's Best,"Masterfully thought out & written. Not your usual supernatural, horror King story. Written in 4-5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural, but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood, follows them through the years & culminates with them as adults. Each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in. At the end they are all tied together in some ways years later. It's ingenious in it's finale and I advise you set aside some time for reading. It's very difficult to put down. Once it grabs your interest, it just sucks you into the story. If you remember your childhood friends (we all do) you'll identify with the story"
books,5 of 5,4.0,Photoshop: CS2,"The Classroom in a Book Series is great for describing functions and tools a user would otherwise not become familiar with. However, the Illustrator text is more accurate in describing how the software responds. That is, some settings and functions do not work like or are not housed where described in the Photoshop text. Still, the book is useful, and I'm happy with it's use as a resource"

books,2 of 4,5.0,Genghis in paperback,"Just finished the paperback edition--which has maps and color pictures. A very good read in the manner of the best dogged English seekers after truth--what can we know about G.K. today? and what does he mean to present day Mongolians and Chinese? A good combination of challenging travel in Central Asia and educated weighing of evidence, with wonderful writing about places"
books,0 of 4,2.0,Plain Bad,"This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Informative and Poignant,"As others have pointed out, this book is hard to put down. It contains tons and tons of interesting facts (generally told with the exactly right amount of humor). This in itself isn't what makes it great (there are many great ""trivia"" books out there). A.J Jacobs' personal tale during his ""quest"" is really what makes this book stand out so much. He really knows how to mix his personal life with what is being learned through the Britannica."
books,5 of 9,5.0,Practical To The Point,Douglas Stone demonstrates great awareness of the subject matter. He states the principles and then illustrates them with powerful examples. He made me think of my own approach in difficult conversations. The person who buys this book will not regret the purchase

books,4 of 4,5.0,"The Best One!  Mr. Lehane, when is the next one coming out?","This was by far the best Genero/Kenzie novel of the series.  I loved this book.  Everything about it.  In this one, you really got to see the emotional side of Bubba.  Made him more likeable."
books,1 of 1,5.0,Standard-setter for western historical study,"More than a simple historical treatise, it is a character study in human nature and its affects on the human actions that make history.  A classic of historical works in its detail and insight on human action we know as history.   Thucydides is unmatched in his insights, clarity of language and thought, and in his informative description of the history of his time.  A must read for anyone wanting to plumb the depths of western civilization and ethos.  An enjoyable read for any historiphile."
books,2 of 2,4.0,Very concise and non-labored reading,"This book tends to jump right in and show you the important parts of the code you will need for your applications. It walks you through creating some of the more requested scripts and explains each step in just enough detail to give you a good grasp. That said, the book isn't a major read at under 300 pages, which makes it light enough to get through in a weekend if needed. I highly recommend this book for those wanting to combine the power of AJAX with the speed and ease of PHP"
books,0 of 2,4.0,Still lots of Laugh out Loud & Big Smile moments,"Some writers are trashing this 10th offering and accusing the author of having someone else write for her.  So What!  I laughed and smiled a lot as this book kept me company on my long daily commute.  Have fun, buy it.. enjoy"
books,6 of 6,4.0,Fun audio adaptation with Ed Asner reading,"I admit I was suspect when I first picked up this set and saw Ed Asner was reading Stormy Weather. Carl Hiaasen books get pretty raunchy at times and I was not sure I could listen to Ed Asner reading about hot and dirty action. I was pleased to find my misgivings to be unfounded. The consummate actor Mr. Asner brings Stormy Weather to life with a dry , sardonic wit that fits the material and allows the listener to get to know the characters and revel in their adventures and misadventures."

books,4 of 7,5.0,how to get out of debt and stay out of debts,thank you for a great book
books,,5.0,Excellent coverage of most topics,"I found several parts of this book exceptional, meaning much better than the average grammar book.  The coverage of first person, second person, and third person writing in both singular and plural forms was well-done, including a later section on first, second, and third person pronouns.  There are also excellent sections on object of preposition and object complement (yeah, I didn't know what that was either).  The sections on pronouns are extremely complete and go on for pages--I didn't realize how many pronouns and types of pronouns there were.  Verb tenses is also covered very thoroughly with many examples of present, past, future, present perfect, past perfect, and future perfect.  Prepositions are covered very thoroughly, including explanations for when they're used (to tell location, direction, time, relationship, etc.) and then a list of prepositions."
books,11 of 11,5.0,Humphries' Lucretius,This is a wonderful book.  Rolfe Humphries did a magnificent job of making this philosophical poet relevant to us in the 20th. The translation is eminently readable and at times reaches heights of beauty that does the great Roman Epicurean justice.  I discovered Humphries' Lucretius 20 years ago.  I've found no other translation to be as accessible or as beautiful.  It's been a consolation to me often in the last two decades and I'm sure it will continue to be in the future.  Lucretius has much to say to us and we owe Rolfe Humphries a lot for giving him to us in a translation that manages to be both profound and charming at the same time
books,3 of 4,5.0,"Beautifully written, well-plotted, mesmerizing tale...","The descriptions of 1882 New York smack of reality more than anything I have ever read. The reactions of the protagonist are the best of any time travel novel I have ever read - truly amazingly authentic. The tale starts out slowly, but brings the reader to an awesome action-packed, never-rushed conclusion.  Extremely satisfying. A beautiful, thought-provoking story. There is everything here, science fiction, mystery, action, philosophy, and a bit of romance.  Highly recommended."
books,3 of 8,1.0,Some friend,"Marlon Brando once said that his friends don't write books about him.  So what does that make Englund?  Marlon said about Carlo Fiore, a once questionable so-called friend, that he probably wrote his book about Marlon because that's all he had left.  The same seems to apply to Englund.  I mean, why describe the gory details of Marlon's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon?  Seriously, would a real 'friend' have done such a thing?  Why not leave us with some glorious memory of Marlon as a true friend would.  I mean, without the help of Englund's book, Marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes, inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today.  Why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the Brando legend?  If Marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma (why we love him), and I believe he did it on purpose, what gives this so-called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows Marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend?  He's a sell-out jerk to me, but that's just my opinion.  Would Alice Marchak (Marlon's assistant) or Jocelyn (Marlon's sister) ever write a book about Marlon?  I don't think so. And they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something, anything about Marlon. They didn't because people who truly love you don't do that.  Englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever, but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life, but not at all in death.  That is the lowest of all the slimballs because Marlon probably died thinking this sell-out was his friend.  NOT!!!"

books,,5.0,"Beautiful, Serene and Graceful","I loved this book! I became a fan of Gail Tsukiyama after reading Women of the Silk and I continue to be a fan at the end of this book. It is so purely and sweetly written. There is not a character that I didnt enjoy. The customs of old Japan was fascinating too. She really captured the aches and the longing of these long suffering people, but it wasn't written with sadness, but hope. This would make a great book club selection"
books,2 of 2,5.0,My first night with Wanda...,"It was the summer of  1967, and I was parking cars at a posh L.A. apartment house, waiting to be sent to basic training, then off to Vietnam. About three in the morning, I picked up a Playboy Magazine. Amazingly, it had fallen open to a short story called 'Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories' by Jean Shepherd.  It was then, and remains today, the funniest story I have ever read. It's the reigning champ, with warm recollections of Jean's grimy midwestern steel town, his cronies and the biggest night in most of our adolescent lives -- the senior prom. If you've seen or read 'A Christmas Story', you'll enjoy the gradual, precise setup and hilarious payoff of 'Wanda.'  I should mention that I write (and read) for a living in the automotive magazine business"

I was kind of embarrassed by Mr. Akio's observation about China, but it is quite honest and down to earth. We Chinese should learn a lot from Japan's rising experiences. From this book, we can learn how to deal with the free world, how to improve the quality of our products, how to simply be open minded... Thanks for Mr. Akio  and his great book"

In the first novel, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy stresses the romanticism of John Grady Cole, who runs away to become a cowboy, suffers a heart-breaking loss at love, and returns, sadder and perhaps wiser, to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains."
books,,4.0,One of the most important TPBs since 80s,"Ok, so maybe art is not so great, maybe not everything is explained, and second half was extremely lame because of showing DeSade as one of invisibles and good guy, but this comic is full of esothery and is social and pop culture kind of  satire and criticism.  Its value is that it points to something nothing else does and first four issues, Dane in London and his initiation are great. Theory of conspiracy fans will enjoy all of the Invisibles, and some of ideas shown in series were reexploited later, watered down of course"

The cover says that it is a highlight reel from Sex and the City, one of my very favorite shows, but it was so opposite of SaTC, that I can't even understand the comparison.  The main character doesn't live in NYC, and doesn't write a column about sex, but does write a column.  It's about a girl, one who hates her evangelical Christian background, so she has sex with a couple guys, but it isn't about loving the man, it's about wanting not to be a Christian.  I finished it to find out what ends up happening, but I was REALLY dissapointed.  Don't but this if you are looking for a fun read or if you don't hate evangelical Christians"
books,6 of 64,1.0,New Age Religion in the Guise of Christianity,"Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.."
books,,5.0,another winner,"This is my wifes rating since she finished the book and I have only started.So far ,I agree.It's another completely different area of the country which make her books so interesting"
books,1 of 4,1.0,This book was voted the worst book ever in my bookclub.,"I read this book with my bookclub.  It sounded witty and fun.  It was not.  It was very boring and a big let down.  Most of the stories went like this:  we found a dead body, this is what we did, then we went home."
books,1 of 3,1.0,Stop... don't do it.  This book is awful.,"The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the ""Changeling"") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again."
books,5 of 5,4.0,Important book!,"I very much enjoyed Drs. Boyatzis and McKee initial offering with Daniel Goleman, ""Primal Leadership"", so I looked forward to learning more about resonnant leadership. I certainly wasn't disappointed. I very much appreciated the author's attention to citations and footnotes, indications of valid and solid research -- something that is becoming increasingly rare in these days of making-it-up-as-you-go writings."
books,2 of 2,5.0,Great Book!,"I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars"
books,,5.0,You Know it When You See It -- And This Is It!,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who is curious or who enjoys reading weird, funny, gross, or just plain interesting annecdotes. The guy invested a lot of time in his quest to read the entire encyclopedia, and if this book is the only result of that investment, it was time very well spent. I loved it"
books,,5.0,Dimension and Depth,"History at its most compelling, a well written account that both illuminates the past and provides lessons for the future.  In the spirit of Rick Atkinson's ""An Army at Dawn,"" it ennobles the participants even while exposing their human flaws and foibles. I've read quite a bit of Pacific War Naval history, and this book does a singularly impressive job of exploring and explaining the Japanese mindset to a Western reader (and vice versa, I'd imagine.)"
books,2 of 2,5.0,Finally... a dog training book that works!,I have 2 dogs who are SO different from one another. This is the first book that takes each dogs' personality into consideration when training your dog. The book is definitely the best I've read on dog training - and I've read alot on this topic!
books,,5.0,Decent.,not my favorite but still interesting.  Lots of description that can get your head pounding after a while though; it's def. not a 2-3 day read
books,3 of 3,4.0,Passed the exam yesterday on first try...,"I purchased this book after reading lot of good reviews on Amazon. My study plan was to read this book and PMBOK thoroughly and take the test. Three weeks before taking the exam, I took the 200 questions @4hrs at the end of book and got 92%. The same day I read some comments about false sense of security one may have after reading this book. I read some reviews where candidates recommended the Rita's book. I immediately purchase Rita's book and read it thoroughly. So my primary book was Andy's and secondary book was Rita's. This strategy paid off very well. In almost 80% questions on exam day, I found myself referring to the Andy's book. Rita helped me in other 20%. This 20% is a lot and can be a deciding factor in your success. Bottom line is GET THE BOTH books. I can never stress enough on this. Read Andy'd first; make it primary and then Rita's. You will feel confident and hopefully do well in exam. I never touched the PMBOK except during the training for 35 contact hrs."
books,4 of 4,4.0,Merits of Index Fund Investing,"Although a good resource book about the benefits of mutual fund investing,I found the title to be a bit misleading. Being the self proclaimed creator of index funds, Bogle cites many years of comparative returns from mutual funds while making the case that,over the long run, investing in index funds will produce the highest returns. I think a more apt title might be  ""Why Index Funds Beat All"""
books,,1.0,Over Rated,"I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The ""bowel movement"" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book"
books,3 of 3,4.0,A Great Story,"Through exhaustive research and interviews with the remaining Badgers, their families, and combat comrades, Frei tells the story of this team of young men who became real-life heroes by fulfilling a much greater calling. In describing their experiences on the football field and in service to their country, Frei makes it clear why the generation young men and women who came of age during the Second World War have become known simply as the ""Greatest"""
books,4 of 8,5.0,Fantastic Find!,"I have a ""special needs"" dog and I have been searching for a book that will give me practical ways to work with her.  This book has given me a lot of helpful information without reiterating the obvious.  Great find!"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Masterpiece,Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read.  Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance
books,4 of 4,5.0,Good intro to inner peace,"I first read this book when I was 19 years old - you always think you know who you are at that age, but you still have so much to learn."
books,2 of 3,4.0,"Very good, but not great","I really enjoyed the book for the most part.  There are some great topics discussed.  I especially enjoyed the chapter on nonprofit/corporation alliances.  The downside: I thought the two chapters regarding Boards were lacking.  Overall, it's definately worth checking out"
books,73 of 100,2.0,"Um, the 50's are over...","Robert Putnam's book bemoans the declne in ""civic participation"" among Americans since its heyday in the 50's and 60's.  Although few would argue that bridge clubs aren't what they used to be, who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962?  This underlines the basic problem with this book: it focuses too much on what constituted ""communities"" and ""activities"" in the past, without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today.  While I agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index, and participation in traditional FORMAL organizations has declined, I would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen.  For example, while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system, college students today volunteer more that any generation before them.  In addition, while participation in mainline Protestant churches has stedily declined, engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically.  While I personally feel that the sterile suburban, drive-everywhere-in-my-SUV existance is soul crushing, and the popularity of reality TV may be a sign of the apocolypse, I also don't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week, while dad worked 9-5, returned home to supper, and went to the Men's Club on Tuesdays at 8.  And while Putnam's basic premise may resonate with many, its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument"
books,4 of 4,5.0,A forward-looking vision...if only it can be applied,"Barker's book provides a radical new way of categorizing technology - something we've been without in the modern age. In addition to giving us a series of frameworks on which we can base our decisions about the direction of our future, he illustrates how our current course in the United States is extremely destructive and ultimately unsustainable.If enough people read this, then perhaps our course can be changed for the better."
books,3 of 3,5.0,Amazing!,"this book is simply amazing! and when i say simply, i also mean that it is an interestingly simple book... very short and concise... and yet filled with so much knowledge and meaning... it really is a treatise on life itself."
books,1 of 2,4.0,Not too shabby,"Good read over all that keeps you interested from start to finish. If you can handle all the monkey business that seems a little goofy at times, it will be an enjoyable read"
books,1 of 8,2.0,The Crossing - a struggle across a border,"The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons."
books,3 of 6,1.0,publicity stunt,"This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks. The book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a ""scholar"" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary"
books,1 of 1,4.0,Much Funnier than Portuguese Irregular Verbs,"No one should read this book thinking it's part of the Botswana books.  I also recommend that you read Portuguese Irregular Verbs first.  Without that background, the humor here won't work as well."
books,13 of 15,1.0,Very Poor Quality,"While I'm sure the stories are great, I can't get past the poor type setting, and cheap paper which is practically newsprint. The words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult. And to make matters worse, the stories are set in a terrible, hard to read font and tight leading. This book is NOT kid-friendly at all. YUCK! Same is true of the Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales by same Author/Publisher"
books,1 of 1,5.0,fabulous....,"These stories are delightful, the illustrations are superb...I bought a copy for my grand-daughter, and was so enthralled that I ordered a second copy for me!"
books,,5.0,Introducing New Characters.,"Dear Reader,"
books,1 of 1,5.0,Great book!,This book has the fundamental of indexing and why we should consider it as part of building our financial portfolio. Bogle is at his best preaching the value of indexing and how it relates to lower cost investing. This eventually translates to higher return for the investors and less profit to the brokerage firms that make money on trading.
books,3 of 3,5.0,Stunning First Novel From a Brilliant Writer,"It was in the last year of the Second World War, while serving together as part of a tank crew, that Archie Jones met Samad Iqbal. What resulted is a powerful but wacky bond between the hapless but easy going Englishman and the better educated, but always underemployed and bitter, Bengali Muslim. This close friendship also brought together their wives: Alsana, who was promised by her family at birth to marry Samad, and Clara, an extremely beautiful Jamaican girl from a Jehovah's Witness family, whose one flaw is that she has no upper front teeth. 18 years old Clara married the much older Archie soon after meeting the middle-aged man at a hippie New Year's Eve party she was attending. Archie crashed the party after deciding not to go through with a suicide over his failed marriage to his Italian warbride."
