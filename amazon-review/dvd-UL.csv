dvd,2 of 4,5.0,BODY BAGS IS A GREAT TALES MOVIE!!!!!!,"Body Bags with John Carpenter is awesome it has some great scary tales in it like The Gas Station and The Eye!!!!!! If you like stuff like Creepshow then you will need to see this one,because you will love it then!!!!"
dvd,8 of 8,4.0,Solid ghost tale,"""The Changeling"" is more mystery than horror film, which is not what I had expected prior to viewing. Nonetheless, this is a good film and I would recommend it. George C. Scott plays John Russell, a classical music composer who loses his wife and daughter in an accident. In an effort to forget this tragedy, he leaves New York City for Seattle. Desiring seclusion in order to practice his compositions, he moves alone into a large, vacant house. It is here that someone, or some thing, begins to contact him. Russell, perhaps realizing he has nothing left to lose, attempts to determine the reason for this. To reveal what or who the Changeling is would be to reveal too much about the movie, so I won't do that here. Unlike some other haunted house films, the ending to this one is moderately satisfactory. The story is told with class, as one would hope for a movie with a classical music composer as it central character. There are no cheap scares, exploitive material such as nudity or gore, and scarcely any bad language. In fact, I'm not really certain why it was rated R and most definitely a re-rating would earn this a PG-13 today. The acting, score and direction are all first rate. I didn't find the movie very scary; however, the suspenseful moments were done well and were fairly effective. The DVD has no extras, though the picture and sound are good. This is worth at least one watch and the price is certainly right."
dvd,23 of 23,5.0,A very good Qigong beginner's introduction DVD,"This DVD lives up to its promises - it introduces you to the world of Qigong. I have personally practised some Qigong exercises before  - from some books - but after watching this DVD I realized that I was doing them somewhat wrong. I didn't see any of what I had been practising in this video, however, doing Qigong is like a poem (actually, it was a poem for ancient Chinese), like a moving meditation, it's soft and smooth, whereas I had a rigid and strict execution. This DVD presents two sets of exercises - sitting (on a bed, let's say) for elderly and weak people, and standing - for everyone else. There is a track presenting the history of Qigong, specifically this set, and detailed explanations of each exercise, including medical benefits (e.g. what internal organ you would be massaging by doing them). Granted, you need more information (e.g.on breathing - it is only briefly touched), but then again, a beginner could only get so much or else (s)he becomes scared of so many new things. Still, Dr. Yang has a book with the same title, I've ordered and received mine (but haven't started reading it yet), that should explain more things. The book and the video complement each other - the former has more information, but the latter shows you the execution. Get them both."
dvd,,2.0,Fatally Flawed,"Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme."
dvd,,5.0,Great Music...Classic Music,Just get this concert and listen to it. That's it...nothing more. It's a 'must have.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Are we really liberated?,"Bunuel turns things upside down in this social critique which, surely, ranks as one of his most effective films. While this film drifts through the surreal world we would expect of Bunuel - the commentary it makes is indeed serious and quite thought provoking. If we, as viewers, are shocked or find humor in the scenes of this film we should stop and ask ourselves - Are we as liberated as we think we are? If you find using the toilet in front of your friends and going off to eat in private absurd - you are not the open minded person you think you are"
dvd,3 of 16,2.0,"Spalding, where are you??","The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism.  It's Gray's defining characteristic.  After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the  best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,HOT AND SEXY VAMPIRE MOVIE!!!!!!!!,"Dracula 2000 is a well done vampire movie that delivers it shares of goth,sexness, and of course a great cast.... When a bunch of thieves go to London to rob a bank they end up finding a coffin and decide to take it with them.... While on flight to the US they soon discover that a vampire is in the coffin and now awaken  and now is in the city of New Orleans..... This movie has all and you should check this hot vampire movie today!!!!!"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Representing relationships...,"Jules and Jim takes its rightful place alongside the Antoine Doinel series as Truffaut's definitive contribution to the cultural dialogue about love and relationships.  With deft psychological insight and an epic narrative perspective, Jules and Jim documents the whims and passions of its characters while letting the long drama and trajectory of life voluptuously fill the space of the film.  "
dvd,3 of 9,1.0,Stick with Willy Wonka,"I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's ""performance"" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,This version is the one to buy....,"If you have a widescreen TV, this is the version you must purchase. Unlike the previous ""Special Edition"" version, this new release is ANAMORPHIC widescreen, finally for the first time and it looks great on my new 32 inch Sony HDTV. The only downside is no sound upgrade, just MONO. The extras are the same as the previous edition. Anyway it is cheap and worth every penny for the new anamorphic transfer. "
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,Great workout for an advanced PIlates student,"I am a Pilates teacher and I really liked this DVD.  THe instruction is clear and concise.  THe exercises start relatively easy and then get very difficult.  The instructors are very informative.  I loved that they took Reformer exercises and put them on the ball.  If you know Reformer, you will really enjoy these exercises with the ball."
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,"Not Terrible, but it's Pretty Down There ","Once again, National Geographic and some producers have gotten together to make a movie. There is so much B-roll of birds, coyotes, bats and whatever else in this flick that if you took it all out the movie itself would be about 50 minutes. Also, since part of this movie takes place in the jungle, there's plenty of unga bunga in junga tribes dancing and running around. You can tell the B-roll really did come from some sort of National Geographic-esque type production house because whenever they use it, there's a lot more grain than the rest of the movie. Now, the movie itself has a horrible dialog and the voice over work doesn't help either. The way the movie flows from scene to scene is absolutley ridiculous too. Whoever planned out the scenes must have been a schizo. Some of the zombies look really good, but the majority of them look like someone just put grey paint on their face. Decent gore, but that's about it"
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Amazine,If you saw it in theaters and liked it then you like this dvd as well.  The special features are awesome
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A beautiful story,"A beautiful story. I really loved this film. In my humble opinion far better than American Me. Violent, but not gratuitously so - unlike most films today. A story of family, of loss, of tragedy. Although I loved them all I really loved Paco. At the beginning he's an arrogant annoying young man, but by the end he's grown up and matured and is the most lovable character in the film. Superb acting from all concerned, and the most touching ending I've ever seen in any film."
dvd,1 of 7,2.0,Hollow-weened Frankenstein Impressive for It's Time,"I'd like to admit here from the start that although I grew up loving the horror genre, that since last midcentury up through the 70s, it went from good B-film status to low-grade garbage, only getting all the worse since that time. I admit that there are those seldom-made fairly impressive works since that time, but very few-and really none adapted from the Mary Shelley book. Technically, then, this would be one of the few decent Frankenstein films I've seen in recent years. Also, having viewed it on TV in the 70s(I was just a child at the time) and now seeing it here on DVD, I was surprised how well a TV film from that period holds up. Jack Smight may not be David Lean-or James Whale, for that matter-but if one goes back to view TV entries for this time period, this is not at all a bad-looking production, whatsoever. "
dvd,,5.0,heartbreaking experience,"Rarely saw a sad story so beautifully told - and it's three of them. A must for everyone to watch - not only for fathers and sons, it's for daughters and mothers too"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,"A Japanese Christmas Miracle!  Oh, it can happen...","Now, there's nothing like seeing a film which you have no idea what it is, about, or anything like that and then bowled over by how great it is.  This is one of those films, and come to think of it even if I had some forewarning it still would've suprised me, becuase this anime covers so much."
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,Here is the track listing ,DVD Description
dvd,1 of 16,1.0,Dated and not very engaging.....,This is among the most boring movies ever made.  All the actors give weak performances and the ending makes you want to go to sleep
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,A good look at Russian boot camp,Excellent movie.  The film quality and color were above average.  It is a somewhat surreal look at young men enduring life in a typical Russian boot camp setting.  Haunting and powerful.  You will want to watch this movie more than once.  You will understand why this movie was banned in Russia.  Not exactly a recruiting tool for the Red Army
dvd,4 of 14,1.0,mr sam,the whole movie was good and word for word with the bible.the issue that i have is the acting played by james brolin did not show peter as commanding.also it seemed to me that there were not enough back ground actors.it was kind of dull
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Even curious enough for adults,"Curious George is fantastic.  Although many people might think that this movie is only made for children, adults will get a kick out of this movie as well.  The music that accompanies the film is great.  It is a warm story that allows you to escape from adult life drudgery and remember what it is to explore and be curious about the world. "
dvd,6 of 23,1.0,Beware,"I made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to.  I don't consider myself overprotective, but these stories have a kid abusing a dog (Pluto), a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone's knee (including showing the kid's bottom from above), and Donald chasing Chip & Dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things.  I turned it off after that.  Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon.  Was a little surprised this made it out of Disney especially in today's day & time....May be okay for older kids, but I don't really want to explain guns or why it's not funny/okay to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"It was good, kina cheesy,,but good","I remember seein in this in a wal mart shelf n thinkin dang havent seen dis!"" so i bought it and played in ma vcr..n thought this movie aint that bad...i thought it was gonna be better like other JC movies like ""Supercop"" ""Police Story 1 and 2...but its own movie all in itself..the plot is kina cheesy..but it still makes sense unlike other JC movies.. the scene u should look out for the most is the end..where he fights 2 guys at the same time ontop of a skyscraper...and after beating them..he throw himself off this steep ledge..JC is wack!! but yeah theres alot of great fights in the movie..and funny moments...i would give it 5 stars if it was the HK version..but i dunno why the hell these american editors would edit these movies so much..they make em suck..not they do,,they good movies..but they strip these movies outta their originality,,i dunno but somebody should protest against this...i mean,,if u want a good movie u gotta do a good search go through all that trouble jus for the HK version wich is better...hell if i was an editor..o wouldt edit anything..id jus add special features to these movies...wich owuld make them more interactive...i hope some one does sumthn about this to make chans movies better, like not take original scenes away..because his movies are truly worth buying...ok i guess i wrote enuff..but take this mind..."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,One of the Best Anime's Ever,"This is one of the best anime's of all-time, not only for the animation, but for all the layers of psychology in the story.  Sometimes it's hard to know what's going on, but that's part of the amazing atmosphere.  "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Touching.,"Great Movie. I have seen it many times in the past, and I just had to own a copy"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Capra's funniest, zaniest, with the usual suspects","This is probably the goofiest movie Capra made and is definitely the funniest.  It's also Capra's tightest.  It is shot like a stage play with only three sets.  And the humor isn't in the lines.  No set ups, no punch lines.  It's in what going on, at nearly every moment, on camera.  People are weightlifting, practicing ballet, playing the xylophone, writing books, all at the same time, while off stage there are explosions from the girl's father who is making fire works in the basement.  If you have seen ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" you'll recognize most of the cast.  And each one of them plays his part as well as it could be played.  Under any other director this movie could easily have gotten out of hand, but it was Capra at his best, and so is this movie"
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Great Set With Some Minor Issues.,From the moment LEGENDS OF HORROR was announced I was looking forward to it with great expectation but I already had a few qualms regarding it. As has been well covered elsewhere Boris Karloff's THE WALKING DEAD from 1936 should have been included in the set but I can live with THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X for a few reasons. 1) It does offer Humphrey Bogart the opportunity to show what a good actor can do with what for him was a thankless role. 2) The director Vincent Sherman was still alive to provide commentary on the making of the film as well as background on Bogie and others. 3) Most important of all it shows how censorship imposed on the movies in 1934 changed the style and content of the first great cycle of horror films.
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,A romantic/emotional roller coaster,"Why some have condemned this movie for the lack of story line, I praise what factual information they were able to find although there was never any final meeting between Hemmingway and Agnes.  All correspondence was done through letters between them after Hemmingway went home from the war and little is known of the letters Hemmingway wrote Angus since a later boyfriend of Angus destroyed all of Hemmingway's letters in a jealous rage.  If there was in final face to face meeting, both their lives may have very different.  More than likely the two would have continued far different lives together.  Hemmingway may have never gone on to become the great writer he was and Agnes would have never continued her nursing career that she seemed much more married to, or a European whirlwind romance may have faded into the first of the many failed marriages Hemmingway went through."
dvd,,5.0,Absence of Malice,Have watched it three times already.....thanks for being so speedy with the delivery
dvd,,5.0,Guiness is Tour de Force in Eight Roles,"This is the best of the Ealing Studio comedies.  Dennis Price plays Louis Mazzini, ninth in line to d'Ascoyne dukedom.  His mother was cut out of the family fortune due to her marriage.  Louis wants to seek revenge by inheriting the family fortune."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,EXCELLENT!,"I have been following Edwin's music for the past 7 years.  He doesn't seem to tour much out West, but I was able to finally see him live in Reno on October 26th.  Edwin was so genuine - autographed 5 of the CDs I had by him.  He was incredible then, and this DVD shows what a dynamic performance he can give.  His live show included all of the songs on this DVD.  If you have bought his latest CD, ""Scream and Whisper"" you will love the live performance of ""Shooting Stars.""  He does an awsome cover of Rod Stewart's ""Maggie May.""  Larry Chaney and Craig Sheilds really come through on this DVD also.  Can't miss on this one"
dvd,12 of 16,5.0,Fantastic series,"This video is a movie length two parter. If you're a DIEHARD ER fan, the first two SEASONS (with the third on the way) are available at Amazon's UK sister store. Surprisingly these are not listed in the Amazon links at the IMDB. Highly recommended to anyone who loves good absorbing drama"
dvd,12 of 16,5.0,WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET A REMASTERED CUT??,"I give this movie 5 stars.  Outstanding story, outstanding performances from the entire cast, an unforgettable climax..everything working together as only Capra could do it!!  I enjoy watching this movie at Christmas time.  Cooper and Stanwyck were teamed twice in 1941...for this..(and for Ball of Fire).  They have great on screen chemistry and both turn in bravura performances....especially Stanwyck.....who should have won the Oscar in 1941 for her work in three of her greatest performances (Lady Eve, Ball of Fire and Meet John Doe).  "
dvd,19 of 20,4.0,Rough Little Diamond,Never been to war; don't want to go to war but for some reason I don't mind watching war.  This is a truly good look at the horror of battle.
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,He was *Caligula* - what do you expect? ,"Once I got past the shock-value, I thought this movie was very daring, for its time. The actors are well-chosen and talented, to be sure, but at times, I found their performances to be somewhat wooden."
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Excellent horror movie.,"This movie, based on an excellent novel by Richard Matheson, is almost as good as its written counterpart. The book is a horror classic, and one of those books you can't put down until its over. The movie captures the essence of the book. Its plot is flawless (thanks to Matheson, who also wrote the screenplay), and the movie is very well done. Supposedly it's based on some other haunted-house movies like ""The Haunting"". I didn't think so (in fact i didn't like ""the haunting"" very much, i think it's extremely slow and boring), as the only thing this two movies have in common is the fact they take place in haunted houses.I really liked this movie, and i think its groundbreaking. I've seen some modern documentaries (1990s) on ghosts and hauntings, and they found relation between electromagnetic fields and supernatural ocurrences. This movie is the first one (at least the first one i've ever seen) that incorporates this ideas, and very early on (1970s).  You really have to watch it! Oh, and if i didn't mention it early, its very SCARY!   "
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,"3.5--""People out of work everywhere and the government just be throwing money away!""...","The Hughes brothers certainly had the right idea in mind making this a cool heist, and I give them credit for trying, but they bite off more than they can chew. Dead Presidents is a really good film. Most people think this movie is all about robbing a bank but it really isn't even though it comes at the end."
dvd,,4.0,The journey's the thing,"I suppose when God comes to us in the form of a beardless Santa Claus, it's difficult to take the vision seriously. But Little Ralph does just that in the new film ""Saint Ralph,"" and he embarks on a miraculous journey of sorts."
dvd,,4.0,Lil Abner,A very good reproduction of an underrated film - lots of gags which are still topical.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Le Boudin C'est Magnifique!,"This is one the best Legion movies to come out in recent years.  A straight-forward plot sets the action in motion.  I must confess to not being a Van Damme fan, and actually knew little about him before this film, but I give him credit for a good job here.  In fact he seems to have co-produced it which I also appluad.  He gives a solid performance combining humor with pathos and sadness.  The film provides a realistic view of the Legion during the murderous Riff Wars of the 1920s.  This was just after WW1 and France was hard-pressed to hold onto her Algerian colonies.  The movie accurately portrays the brutal atmosphere of the Legion from training to combat.  The harshness of life, the tough NCOs and the inadequate officers who indifferently lead the Legion are all well shown.  One can almost say that this is a modern re-make of BEAU GESTE, but it also combines elements of MARCH OR DIE as well.  Still, there is enough here that is original and allows LEGIONAIRE to stand on its own with those two earlier classics.  The film movies quickly and is handsomely produced.  Fans of the Legion will surely enjoy, and those use to Van Damme in a different kind of film may be intriqued as well.  No doubt the only Legion film we may see for a while it follows in the tradition of that genre.  Recommended."
dvd,12 of 12,4.0,"Shamefully Overlooked Southern Gothic Murder Mystery Has Atmosphere, Genuine Thrills and the Superb Blanchett","This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then."
dvd,,5.0,excellent,i thought this was a good movie..mainly because gerard butler is in it and he is a very good acto
dvd,,5.0,JUST LOVE IT,I love this show. I would recommend it to anyone. I wish it was still on the air. I like that it includes the kids and the ex-spouses
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,For Lovers of Screwball Comedy,"Claudette Colbert is brilliant in this fine example of Preston Sturges' work. Vaguely reminiscent of ""It Happened One Night,"" this film features a notable performance by Rudee Vallee"
dvd,2 of 16,5.0,"Bottom line:  DVDs small, VHS big",I did like this dvd.  I bought it and put it in the machine and it worked.  The sound and picture were better than my old vhs.  Also the dvd is smaller and so takes less space (phew!).  I did think it was racist though to portray black people as slaves
dvd,3 of 5,4.0,Hard to tear away from,"Very moody, somewhat psychadelic film concerning mind control via cable TV. A rougue cable station spell-binds its viewers who then do things they would not normally do. People have things in thier stomachs that you can't imagine. It has a dystopian flavor to it, and, as phantasamagorical as it is, it  commands your silent attention. It leaves an after-taste remeniscent of The Eyes of Laura Mars, and Blue Velvet. Only for people like me"
dvd,2 of 5,4.0,Miike + Horror = A fun and scary time.,"Went to Blockbuster last night since I was bored and ran across this movie. I seriously never heard anything about it, but I do like some 'A-Horror' and I liked Ichi the Killer. I wasnt to excited about it cause I recently watched Pulse and thought it was pretty dumb and very slow and not that scary (except for the couch scene which I almost had to fast forward it was damn tense and freaky). "
dvd,,4.0,Brilliant movie,"Worth signing upto amazon to get this, its a great movie. Anyone who thinks they remember watching it when they were younger it's just as funny now and you should all give this one a look again"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Superb,"As a child the original ""Death Takes A Holiday"" was a midnight favorite.  With that in mind, this film was under close scrutiny. It excelled.  If you have ever been love, truly in love, you will be moved to tears by this film.  It is breathtaking.  "
dvd,35 of 36,5.0,Outstanding,"This film is unbelievably good. I DVR'd it on Free Speech TV, and I have watched parts of it again and again."
dvd,,5.0,A perfect ending,"This is the best ending to a anime I have seen.  You're not really sure what's going happen or even in some parts, what has happened.  I like like the fact that the last disk was a three part episode, almost like a movie"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Rarities interesting, rest has been seen before","The promotional videos from ""Totally Hot"" are fun to watch, especially if you're a fan of ONJ circa 1978-79. In my opinion this is when she looked her best - and she definitely is totally hot in the album cover photo session. Even though she's trying to look sexy, and does, the warmth of her personality is still evident. Unfortunately, the rest of the DVD is from the ""Physical"" video collection and the 1982 concert, both of which have been available on VHS for years (and the concert clips look like they were transferred directly *from* the VHS version, no digital enhancement, no nothing!) Video Gold 2 is definitely better as it contains more rarities, even if the majority of the songs are post-prime ONJ - although _Soul Kiss_ still sounds great"
dvd,,5.0,LOVE IT! BUY IT! TREASURE IT!,"This movie was great from beginning to end.  Madea kept it real!  She is ole school for sure!  She is my mother and my grandmother.  A love story and real life events that I and alot of people can relate to.  I can watch this movie over and over! The lyrics to the songs in this film told the story also.  Great movie!  I love it!  I have seen this film over 50 times and the church scene in the ends gets me everytime!  Diary of a Mad Black Women tells a  a love story, fighting addiction, how important family is, don't forget where you came from and how you got there and most of all If you don't have anybody else you got your family. Last but not least Give praises to the Lord.  The soundtrack is a must have too.."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Intellect Techno House Progressive,"After being into the ""techno"" scene since my first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards does a great job with the ""How to DJ"" part. Not only is this for the ""newbies"" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW that sounded like an infomercial"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Pippin on DVD,"Always loved this musical.  Saw it back in the early 70's.  Love William Katt in role.   While quality of DVD lacks at times, I chalk it up to the times!  Ben Vereen is super.  A little disappointed that most songs are chopped, but figure they had to compensate for running time on tv. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Magic,"What a movie! Believe me, it's a touching and marvelous experience to watch a film like this one. Photography is impressive (the color and the angle shots are unique) and the music forms a perfect mix with the scenes. "
dvd,0 of 3,2.0,One of the worst moderately high budget movies ever,"I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews, but this one deserves it. Watching the movie made me wonder if Roger Moore was going to actually say ""I'm only doing this for the money""."
dvd,,5.0,Dustin at his off-beat best...,"I guess I've seen this at least five times over the years, but it is always enjoyable. Hoffman is fascinating to watch as he switches from failed male actor to successful female TV star. An excellent supporting cast helps as well, and in fact, all the elements came together for the production team on this project. If you missed it, make a point of remedying that gap in your knowledge of successful movies."
dvd,,4.0,Disney rewrites Greek Mythology,"What a shock, Disney changed a story when they adapted it to an animated feature.  Hercules is representative of the whole Disney canon in this aspect.  This has been the norm for Disney going back to Snow White so I think complaints don't hold much water, especially if someone is willing to accept previous changes made in other Disney films."
dvd,,5.0,Hard to describe,It is almost impossible to describe all the emotions that went through me while watching this film. My husband and I were extremely moved when we saw it on TV and purchased the DVD so we could watch it again and again. 
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,SIXTIES SPOOF OF EARLY SLAPSTICK FEATURING TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY AUTO RACE,"Two films were made in 1965 that both catered to the current interest in turn-of-the-20th-Century history and wacky humor: The Great Race and Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. The former was also a spoof on slapstick humor, like the Keystone Cops, and early melodramas that featured heroes in white hats and villains in black. Most of the slapstick, along with the black duds, come from villains Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk. Tony Curtis provides the white hat, and Natalie Wood offers a bodice bountiful, along with the most costume changes ever seen in a single film. Director Blake Edwards is known for his off-the-wall humor, as evidenced by the Pink Panther series; but here he tips his hat to the icons of the silent era, as well as snubs his nose at the cliches: barroom brawls, pie fights, booby-trapped cars, sword fights, escapes from castles, mistaken identities, crazy racing machines, daredevil feats, crazy flying machines - it's all here."
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,This is a very entertaining movie,I saw this movie on cable TV a year ago and thought it was very entertaining and worth watching again.  I looked online to buy a copy but found that it was not available on DVD.  So I was very surprised to see that it recently became available to buy.  Amazon has it available for $20.99 which they reduced from $24.00 but you can buy the movie on www.towerrecords.com for $13.99 and pay no shipping charge if you purchase $20.00 or more.   Enjoy
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,FORT APACHE-THE GREATEST WESTERN EVER!!,"I have another review of this GREAT John Ford classic under the ""John Wayne-John Ford Collection"",which includes eight(8) classic Wayne-Ford motion Pictures that include:""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""(great Technicolor Western),""Stagecoach"",(the film that made Wayne a Star and brought back the Western,along with DeMille's ""Union Pacific"",back to A-Level movie status)""They Were Expendable""(a WW2 film set in the Pacific,co-starring Wayne and Robert Montgomery),"" 3 Godfathers""( Often filmed Western story that Ford made as a silent,starring Harry Carey,sr.,who this film is  made in Memory of),""The Long Voyage Home""(nearly forgotten Ford masterpiece,derived from four (4) Eugene O'Neill playlets,adapted by Dudley Nichols),""The Wings of Eagles""(the true story of Frank ""Spig"" Wead,WW1-WW2 flying ace and real life pal of Ford,with Wayne-O'Hara as husband & wife,with NOT ENOUGH MAUREEN!),and a special 2-disc DVD set of that great anti- racist post-Civil-War Western, ""The Searchers""."
dvd,,5.0,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,"This movie is wonderful!  Not suitable for very young children, but ok for adolescents.  The story is wonderful.  Love, joy, happiness, and living life to the fullest"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Pro-Communist Garbage?!?!,"I say this because this film is not about communism at all.  I'll bet you that Collatine probably thinks the same way about the Matrix.  If you are so paranoid as to think this movie is ""Pro-Communist Garbage"", then you probably also think that the movie The Thing (another great John Carpenter Film"" is nothing but Propaganda on the AIDS Virus and that those infected must be from another world and are not human.  That sounds ridiculous right?  Well so is Collatine's claim about the movie They Live.  They Live is a great Sci-Fi movie that targets paranoia similar to his.  I normally don't reply to comments made by other reviewers, but this statement of stupidity infuriates me.  Now I shall continue on with the review of They Live.  "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,A PASSIONATE VALUER!,"Kevin Sullivan's TV movie ""Anne Of Green Gables"" is as unusual in theme as it is beautiful.  On the surface, this 4-hour adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel deals largely with everyday events (everyday, at least, for Canada's rural Prince Edward Island, in the early 1900's).  But in terms of fundamentals it is a richly romantic story about values and their role in human life."
dvd,,1.0,ALOT OF JUNK MOVIES HAVE BEEN RELEASED LATELY ,"and this is one of them. The characters were to silly to be funny, musically shorts were dim, animation was cheap, usual for Disney, script was bad. Suitable for those 5 and under, maybe"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,And how!,"""Dead End"" is the first movie I have seen where Humphrey Bogart plays in one of the leading roles the ""hoodlum"" that he often portrayed as a minor character. He has the mannerisms down, the sneer and the steely murderous glare. He has that dangerous presence on display in this 1937 movie that he would use to good effect throughout his career. I believe this movie also introduced the ""Dead End Kids"". The movie was scripted by Lillian Hellman, from a play by Sidney Kingsley (he won the Pulitzer for it), and this quality source material shows through."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its funny, gives you a moral and everything. The only people who hate this movie are smart jerks who have no sense of humor or people that dislike Adam Sandler b/c he is Jewish. I don't know anyone that hates him. If you love to watch holiday movies during the holidays, this is one to watch. But it isn't for kids. It is a great holiday movie and a great movie overall. F*ck you if you hate this or Adam Sandler"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Don't miss this wonderful film!,This Amazon data lists French only in the Language column but it's an error. This DVD has original Mandarin along with French as audio. It's truly a woderful film. This film reminds you how woderful love is.
dvd,3 of 6,2.0,"Fantastic musical scores, acting production good but uneven and busy","Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of ""show don't tell"" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene ""announcing"" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do ""too much"" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"Charming, Lovely, Wonderful . . . ","Queen Latifah will charm the socks off you as shy cookware department store clerk Georgia Byrd who takes a ""last holiday"" when she discovers she only has three weeks to live.  LL Cool J is adorable as fellow employee Sean, with whom she is in love.  Your heart just rends for her as she cries at her kitchen table."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,I liked it.,"Aeon Flux is a good watch for anyone who enjoys lots of action(and the fact that a woman is doing the butt kicking makes it an even better watch).  I personally like the storyline about how a virus attacks 99% of earth's population and how they are trying to correct the damaging effects of the cure. I was mesmerized by the screen the whole time it was running. Kept my attention, kicked butt, and left me overall more than satisfied"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Creepy, Devilishly, Rollercoaster Ride!","Gore, buckets of blood, demon transfermations, good special effects[even though dated), suspence,what more do you want? If you can put up with the some of the bad acting(not that important),you will love this movie. I suggest to get your popcorn early because once the first demon raises its ugly head, the gore fest rollercoaster ride begins"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Brilliant,"How come we see men like Murrow only in black and white Hollywood movies? I for one think that such men dont exist in the US anymore - atleast not in positions of significance. In this day and age where we can see pro-israeli bias even in the so called ""liberal"" press, where everyone in the US, except Noam Chomsky, is afraid of telling the truth, stories of men like Murrow should be told loud and clear. When values like the ones Murrow fought to upheld perish, so will the US. Its impossible to change extreme-right people like Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter but reporters from the so called ""liberal"" newspapers and channels should see this movie...especially those who have connections with Israel, because, all of a sudden, they seem to be having some problems telling the truth. They should remember, like Murrow said, that ""Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences. No one can eliminate prejudices - just recognize them."" In fact, the journalists today make me wonder if ""editorializing"" is a good thing. The media seems to have become a vital part of the government spin machine. Anyway, the bottomline is that this is a fantastic movie. Good entertainment if nothing else"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Wake up Donnie...,"Wow, what a great movie. one of Jake Gyllenhaals best performances yet in my opinion. "
dvd,2 of 2,2.0,My first review was too harsh (2.5 stars),"When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.  "
dvd,,5.0,great ideal ,"for  all of us who were children of the 70's, this is a dream come true. before the days of vcrs, you watched a program and saw it in reruns in the summer and that was it. now you can buy the dvd's of some of those great dvds. the only problem i had with this was that i did not know that you could put something on both sides of the dvd. so i was sitting stupidly wondering where the rest of the episodes were. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,One of my favorites.,I find it funny that other reviewers are complaining about the plot development and character development. Is that seriosuly what you're looking for in a Jack Black film?
dvd,,5.0,WHOA!,This is the best season so far ....EASY to get hooked on this one so WATCH WITH CAUTION!  You won't be doing anything else
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,A Wonderful Film,"C'mon! Admit it! You love sappy love stories. Especially with a sci-fi twist. Yes, this is cute and harmless, and a real tear jerker. But you know you are gonna love it even more when you see it done by Mel Gibson. Jamie Lee Curtis and Elija Wood also do a great job. The main thing here is that the characters make the story believeable and enjoyable."
dvd,,5.0,Classic in Every Sense of the Word!!,"Dick Van Dyke brigns to life Caracticous Pott, an inventer whose inventions never seem to work out the way he wants. One thing I didn't realize for the longest time was the play on words in the creation of name. Take Caracticous Pott. He's a 'Crack-Pot' inventor."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Pay It Forward!,"I first purchased ""Power Yoga for Athletes"" for myself because I was searching for DVD's that really pushed my limits. Some other workout programs left me feeling as if I had hardly worked at all! Not this one. I felt my strength increase with each workout. The best thing was I bought one for my nephew who plays football in high school and he was impressed with all aspects in building strength and flexibility. This may have been the one of the greatest gift I could have ever given him"
dvd,17 of 17,5.0,Reading excellence,My daughters enjoy this dvd. My 6 year old is already reading much better. She has learn to pause and stop in all the right places. I am very happy with this purchase
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,The best documentary about Air Force One.,"I had first seen this on the History Channel and when I found out it was coming on video, I got it immediately.  It was a very impressing film.  I was fascinated to learn about the history of Air Force One and how  presidential travel by air was formed.  I was also surprised that they had  interviews with former presidents and Air Force One crewmembers which I  enjoyed.  I think that this a really great film and I think it's worth  watching"
dvd,,5.0,All-time classic social satire,"I saw Fight Club in the theaters in '99, not knowing anything about Chuck Palahniuk at the time and figuring at best it would just be a decent action movie.  What I saw absolutely blew me away as a film that makes one *question* life, consumerism and where we're going as a society.  It was far better than any standard action/thriller could have been; so often it triggered in me brief moments of introspection (""how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight"", ""if you died right now how would you feel about your life?"", the whole Raymond K. Hessel scene); intellectual script-writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others, and to top it all off probably the most innovative (albeit difficult to believe) surprise ending in film history cement Fight Club as a cult classic with a multi-layered, complex message that would make it perfect for a University student review essay."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"""Don't Misbehave!""","Ted is a lonely bellhop. He's got the whole hotel all to himself on New Year's eve. So, what else can he do but be the lap dog for every requesting customer. But, he only has to worry about four particular, and sometimes peculiar, rooms. Each room is a story involving ted, directed by four different directors. Call it a collaboration of different comedic talents. So, let's go through them, one by one."
dvd,,4.0,terrific find!,"I love this DVD because it makes you work. And because you can customize your workout you won't get bored. Instead of being unable to finish an hour long DVD and feeling frustrated, you can start with one complete mini workout and just slowly work your way up. It's also great for busy people. Who doesn't have 10 minutes. I do it in the mornings to wake up! This is a good buy"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Great Babe Bio,I've watched this DVD time and time again.  The people who knew him really give some insight here as to what kind of player and person Babe Ruth was
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Bille August the Conquerer,This is a wonderful film which gets a 10 on my rating scale.
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,a brilliant Buddhist film...,"...the main point of it being, clinging to life and resisting death (life and death ultimately being two sides of the same coin) only multiplies and intensifies human suffering.  Beyond all simplistic dualisms of ""good vs. evil"" or ""heaven vs. hell,""  learning how to let go is the only salvation.  "
dvd,8 of 39,1.0,Yesterday. That was yesterday. ,"There will always be the question of importance between sports and money.  Which is more important?  Do today's players participate because they love the game, or is it because they are thrown millions of dollars to play?  It is a question that will continue to be a part of our culture as long as million dollar contracts are signed.  I couldn't help but think of this concept as I watched this film.  In 1919 the players of a winning Chicago baseball team decided to throw in their chances of a World Series title just to earn some extra cash for their pockets.  The results of this game lead to interrogations, an appointment of a baseball commissioner, and a decree that would punish these ball players for the rest of their lives.  For those of us that were not around in 1919 to experience this event first hand, director John Sayles has decided to show us the events first hand through dry cinematography, horrific acting, and a drama that is lacking in ... well ... drama."
dvd,,4.0,AMACORD,"I have been a strong admirer of Fellini's films and my recent purcase of 'Amacord"" did not let me down. Set in the 1930's, this film featuring provincial Italy during this period, is full of droll scenes, some of them very funny indeed. Typical of Fellini, this film is a mosaic of fantasy and reality. Italy was in the pre war era of Mussolini and Fellini takes digs of the fascist regime including a hilarious scene featuring a parade. To balance this, there is a brief scene featuring the sinister side of fascism. From a biography written by Tullio Kezich ( a worthwhile read for Fellini admirers) I found that the tiltle comes from 'm'acord', the dialect of Rimini for ""I remember'. Rimini is ellini's birthplace and ""Amacord"" is full of memories of his youth there, presented in his unique style. In 1975, this film won an Osca for best foreign language film. For followers of this genre, I highly recomend ""Amacord"""
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"BEAUTIFULLY DONE, Q BRANCH. . .","Just in time for the Holidays and the new 007 adventure, (at last) a straightforward version of CASINO ROYALE, the Q Branch of Fox Home Entertainment (yes, Fox!) has not only repackaged all 20 of the Bond films, but each one is now in a double-disc edition with scads of bonus features, commentary tracks, trailers, interviews, behind the scenes stuff and more and more and more!  "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,fat-blasting indeed,"I'm rather suprised at the less-than-stellar reviews for this dvd, as it's one of my favorites. I'm going to go ahead and jump straight into listing the pros and cons:"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,This *is* the original show,"Greg the Bunny might as well be nicknamed ""Energizer"" - he just keeps going and going.  The Greg the Bunny show started on cable access, graduated to pay cable with a short interstitial show on IFC, then moved to network on Fox (the other DVD available on Amazon), and finally back to IFC with more shorts.  This DVD is a compilation of some of the best of the pre- and post-Fox film parodies.  If you like your puppets twisted with a pinch of pathos, this is a must-get.  Just don't let your kids watch it"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent instructional book,"Truly a gem!  David's instructions are crystal clear and his hints are simply brilliant.  The exercises are easy enough so that you don't give up after the first workout, but hard enough so that you know if you're doing them correctly"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,It would be very funny if it were not based on a true story,"The acting is great and the storyline funny and sad at the same time.  Viola Davis, my favorite actress, is great as usual.  I recommend the film"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,DVD is chaptered!,"I am glad, very glad to have ordered this DVD, it IS chaptered now. Chaptered or not-chaptered, it's more convenient than using a VHS. I love the low-impact yet effective ways of Callanetics; can't wait to get started"
dvd,,5.0,The Immortal Gary Cooper,"Cooper was always outstanding!  In this one, he is brilliant!  Not to be missed! "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A Believable and Effective Plot,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie out of the series.  The Living Daylights is a Bond film that has depth and realism.  The film isn't the typical Bond movie.  It has a hardcore spy plot.  Other films in the series like this includes FRWL and OHMSS.  As an actor Timothy Dalton brought intensity and passion to the role. No other Bond has reacted to situations with human qualities like Dalton did.  For example,  in the fair scene Dalton jumps up abruptly with anger and ready to kill when he finds out that Saunders was murdered. Previous Bonds did not show emotion like this(with the exception of George Lazenby). Dalton's performance made the movie transcend the title of being ""just a Bond movie"".  In some Bond films (especially the Bronsnan entries) the gadgets, the action, the jokes, and the escapades overpower the movie's  plot.  That is not the case with The Living Daylights.  There is a balance between action and plot.  The humor is witty without taking away from the serious nature of the film.  After watching Roger Moore's parody and silliness it was refreshing to watch Dalton take a darker approach in The Living Daylights.  Dalton's monogamous approach also made the film stand out.  Throughout the film Bond stayed with one woman-Kara Millovy (The pre-credits woman doesn't count).  Also, an important aspect to me in a Bond film is a believable down-to-earth villain.  This film accomplished just that.  Necros, Yogi, and Brad Wittiaker made classic intelligent villains.  Cartoonish villains such as Jaws make me disgusted with the series.  In conclusion, if you want parody from a Bond movie watch entries like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun, and Diamonds are Forever. However, if you want to watch a Bond movie with substance watch this movie, License to Kill, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service"
dvd,8 of 9,4.0,Well-done adaptation- a period piece such as we seldom see,"Too often, the characters in period pieces seem stuffy or sexless, when we know good and well they were getting it on quite as much back in the day. After all, we're here, aren't we?"
dvd,8 of 10,4.0,I'm A Straight Republican,"In one of my classes, we studied the infamous ""twinkie defense,"" and I was enthralled by the whole ordeal. Wanting to learn more, I rented this dvd, and was not disappointed. "
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,"great episodes, horrible features","ill agree with the above poster to say that yes, buy it if you're a huge fan and want to add it to your collection, if you're buying it for the features, DON'T. The deleted scenes only includes just over 30 versus season 2's 130, no bloopers, no casting auditions (jay, alex, chris, amy anyone?"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,I never get tired of watching it.,This movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy.   
dvd,0 of 2,1.0,another Van Damme flop,"purely for fans of crappy Van Damme movies again like I says. really corny from beginning to end. Paul Sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one. Rob Schnider is wasted and WHY THE HELL WAS HE IN THIS I will have no clue. Van Damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in Double Team. with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said HEY!!!! damnit, lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here"
dvd,,5.0,Excellent movie!,"The Cheadle brothers teamed up to play the role of the young and adult Earl Manigault.  Supporting actors (Don cheadle, James Earl Jones, Michael Beach, Clarence Williams III, Glen Turman, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Garnett, the producer himself Eriq La Salle, and many others) were great as well.  I'm a fan of 'believable' movies and this one really pulls you in.  Eriq La Salle struck gold on this one and played a heck of a role himself!  This movie will leave you with a sobering outlook on how fragile and valuable life truly is.  I like it so much that I have it on VHS and I just orded it on DVD.  It's a must have"
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,"lovely made, just forced to see preface without skipping","i do love this dvd, my 28 month old daughter does so, is not too scary, it is well made with all the sesamestreetcharacters."
dvd,,5.0,Fantastic performance with wonderful performers!,"This is the first time I have seen a musical theatre performance at Carnegie Hall. I, too, was in tears by the end of the show. The music and the voice performances were exceptional, especially Brian Stokes-Mitchell! This gentleman needs to do more diverse work so that those of us who can't make it to Broadway can enjoy his performances in other venues"
dvd,,5.0,Great Concert Footage and Music,"Haven't seen this since it was in the theaters almost 20 years ago. This is an excellent concert DVD. The documentary footage is the usual rockumentary stuff, going to Graceland and seeing Elvis's grave and talking deeply about the meaning of the music (which the band actually mocks and laughs about doing). But the music and seeing U2 in their prime as this monolithic juggernaut of musical talent, charisma and stage performance is just magical. The music is great and Bono is the air apparent to the thrown of Savior of Rock and Roll. He is THE MAN. One highlight that was not actual concert footage is them working with B.B. King. Also love the beginning, ""Charles Manson stole this song from the Beatles... we're stealin' it back,"" as an intro for Helter Skelter. The first half is in black and white for all the new songs that they were introducing. Then when they get to most of their big hits in the second half it is in color"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Funny, yet very tragic",This movie is a knockout comedy/murder mystery. Jerry is an excellent example of the modern tragic figure. One almost feels sorry for him despite his wrongdoing as his desparate plan to solve his financial situation spins out of his control.
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A higher level buddy comedy,I didn't watch this one before
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,An extraordinary delightful cinematic experience...,"At the end of World War II when the Nazis were leaving occupied Finland, Veikko, young Finnish soldier, is chained to a rock.   Veikko struggles resiliently to get free from his chains as he knows that his life depends on it.  After a long struggle with the rock he is finally free and he stumbles across the home of Anni, a Lapp, who is sheltering a Soviet soldier, Ivan, that has been injured from an attack.  Ivan attempts to kill Veikko as he thinks he is a murderous fascist, however, Ivan fails in his slaying of Veikko.  This is the beginning for a friendship among the three as Anni provides a sanctuary for both men.  However, this sets up several misinterpretations and assumptions as none of them speak the same language.  Cuckoo is a warm and funny drama that keeps the audience smiling and feeling the pain and happiness of each character as they regain some hope after a long and cruel war.  This sets up a delightful and extraordinary cinematic experience that will keep the audience cheerful"
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,Patience is rewarded,"I knew I should have waited!  I got impatient and bought the Masterworks DVD and after watching it once could not bear to see it again, the colors were that awful.  Of course I have to get this, but it's still galling."
dvd,13 of 14,5.0,(:D),GREAT FUN & ENTERTAINING.
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Incredible Documentary,"This documentary is incredible.  As a young, athletic guy, it's a testament to this film's integrity that I actually cried.. numerous times.  I've seen it twice; one time on a two-part television series and once after renting it from the library.  I cried not once but both times.  This movie is an emotional rollercoaster.  I'll be smiling and laughing at one moment, crying at the next, and intrigued just minutes later.  What a wonderful movie.. that's why I'm now buying it"
dvd,22 of 31,5.0,THIS IS A COLLECTOR SET--NOT FOR THE AVG PERSON!!,"The reason this set is called a collector set is because it is just that.. As the description says.. these are the FIRST films Disney put on DVD.. they are in the original format of their time for the purpose of collecting.. for people interested in seeing how the movies evolved.. for having a piece of Disney history.  As for price.. it probably costs Disney way more to produce a ""LIMITED EDITION"" for those few special people interested in such a collection than it takes to produce these for the masses.. "
dvd,,5.0,Long waited DVD,"Well, this is one of the long-waited DVDs from Pink Floyd."
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Wonderful in Every Way,"I expected fabulous dancing, but this movie is hilarious as well.  I laughed until I cried.  The plot centers around mistaken identity, which is a sure-fire comedic convention if done well, and it is done very well here indeed.  Astaire and Rodgers are very funny, but the supporting players are masters of comedy.  Highly enjoyable"
dvd,,1.0,Are you kidding?????,DONT watch this movie the only reason you should watch this movie is to see how bad it is they shoulda called it backstreet boys from hell even the cheesiest horror movies seem amazing compared to this its a true waste of time
dvd,,2.0,child didn't like,"My daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and don't like it.  They also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it.  My 9 yr. old especially likes the tae bo better.  I bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout, but they don't want to do this one at all.  I thought they would, and I'm sure as the other reviews have stated, love it but they didn't.  I guess it just depends on the child"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art -- Captivating, Reverent, Tear-Inducing","""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Sephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.    "
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,Good start; better than Season 2; not as good as Unlimited,"Most of the episodes are really good; there are a couple that are a bit stupid or boring, but that's not the fault of the animators--it's the fact that DC simply doesn't have as many good villains as Marvel, so some of the threats make you roll your eyes.  Nonetheless, it's great to see the Big 7 working together.  My biggest gripe would be that the Flash is portrayed as being *a lot* slower than he is/should be.  There are times when villains can visually follow him or can act in advance of an attack.  In fact, the Flash would have finished his attack before they even got to finish a single breath.  I also prefer Kyle to John as the Green Lantern, but the overall characterization of all the characters is really good, and the stories are intelligently written.  They don't dumb it down in order to appeal to very young children--someone actually got a clue and realized that kids are much smarter than people give them credit for.  This is a worthwhile purchase, and I can highly recommend Justice League Unlimited Season 1, which is actually better again"

dvd,0 of 1,2.0,Tha' Feed back from 'tc' in  berkley.......,....is korrect with this one. I haven't seen her video and I WOULD NOT buy a single one because I know EXACTLY what 'tc' is talking about.  
dvd,0 of 4,2.0,Love at First Drunk?,"Storyline very contrived as Kim and Bruce profess their love for each other on a rather slick squeaky sofa/chair after one long extended blind date.  It just didn't make sense, you really have to suspend belief that their relationship barely a week old and bereft with alcoholic stupors could be genuine.  Rent it if you want, Larroquette is funny as the obsessive crazed ex-boyfriend and Bruce has fun with this as his first screen outing and Bassinger plays drunk fairly well.  But unless you can find it in a bargain bin, it's not worth buying  "
dvd,,5.0,I miss this toon.,"Home Movies has to be one of the funniest cartoons ever done for American TV. I really miss this show, and I wish it had achieved a larger audience."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Wish it sounded better.......,"If this review concerned itself only with the quality of the writing and the cast it would definitely contain five stars.  This is one of the funniest shows ever created, especially if you've ever worked in a fine dining establishment or had any experience with a top flight chef.  The sound quality, however, is not very good, making it difficult at times to understand the dialogue.  This is unfortunate, because the pacing of the show is excellent and the wit is razor sharp.  Perhaps it is my aging ears that are the problem, but I doubt it."
dvd,14 of 18,1.0,False Advertising...?  It Seems to be Spreading.  We Need to Stop This!,"This review has nothing to do with the show, per se.  It has to do with an inceasingly prevalent technique of editing out portions of the show in question, due primarily, to music rights."
dvd,,4.0,"Face it Gang, it's Good","What is not to like ? Great story and top notch acting. Yun-ah Song and Hyeon-jun Shin are outstanding in there roles, I will be keeping my eye on these two."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Superman Animated Series Volume III,"This was an excellent season for the final season of this show. Tim Daly was excellent as superman(voice) and this season was well written. The best part of this season was the finale, ""Legacy"". I would buy this season just for that alone. ""Legacy"" is a 2-part episode where Darkseid abducts Superman, brainwashes him, and makes him lead the Apokoliptic army. I wont mention anything else to spoil anything for anyone."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Fairy Tale Film,The use of fairy tales in this film is absolutely ingenious.  The way in which different fairy tales are interspersed in the plot is what makes this such a great movie.  I espcially loved the way certain fairy tale characters who generally get a bad name are turned into good characters in this movie
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Cheyenne,"This is a mans western,the stories are well done. I await the next seasons release"
dvd,3 of 16,5.0,This is one of my top 5,"This anime has a very interesting story and well developed characters compared to many anime and even independent movies. I will not get in details but I can tell you that it deals with brotherhood, romance, friendship and betrayal. In this anime you will not find any funny or riddiculous jokes as most of then have."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Marvel at the Simultaneous Beauty & Embarassment,"The first season of ""Degrassi Junior High"" often came very close to feeling like public access, with a miniscule (at best) budget and often very wooden/weird acting. A true guilty pleasure. From a technical standpoint, Season Two was a big improvement. New topics tackled included depression, divorce/remarriage, and sex. The teen actors clearly developed their talents and come off more believable as they did in Season 1. The camerawork and direction also improved. "
dvd,4 of 4,2.0,Good show but both the DVD and VHS are editted,"I am in agreement with several of the reviews that indicate the DVD version is editted.  Sadly, so is the used VHS copy I purchased.  Maybe it was once available on VHS uneditted but not anymore.  Beyond the scenes already mentioned as missing, additional scenes include more background on the Mac team and Steve Job's recruitment for the team; early discussions at Apple to make the Mac open source; and an extended scene about the ""Microserfs"".  By my count there are 21 edits (large and small) which add an additional 15 to 20 minutes.  I see no reason for the edits since they could easily fit on a videotape or stereo DVD.  I am guessing Bob thought he improved the pacing of this program by the edits and a few are more ""politically correct.""  But I am still waiting for the full version.  In the meantime, I will keep my old broadcast edition"
dvd,3 of 5,4.0,VERY CLEVER,Disney took alot of old clips from many Princess Classics and mixed it in with some new songs and new clips about Christmas.  My three year old watched it 3 times today and loves it.  I think its a little boring but what does that matter?  She finds it very entertaining.  Its worth the $13.  Buy it for your princess

dvd,,5.0,Nobody !,"This is a hilarious movie.  Not everybody likes what I like, but this is a classic comedy. This film does what it was made to do, let me escape into a western with a lot of laughs and come away smilin'  Patrick Spenc"
dvd,9 of 11,5.0,Highly enjoy it,"I enjoy this anime not because it has the ""Final Fantasy name"""
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,2758 (Ab Urbe Condita)," Would ""Caligula"" or ""Nero"" be shocked at what their city, the Eternal City, has become so many years into the distant future? Or would they (probably more likely) find themselves fitting right in somehow? This is one of the notions that I found myself pondering as I watched this movie. It really is a great movie, and it is certainly worth any true film fan's time. I may have even liked (some of it at least) better than (again, some of) La Dolce Vita. "
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,"""Murder! That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.""","Howard Hughes' big-budget World War 1 classic has never looked better in this beautifully restored dvd edition. While the dialogue is corny and dated and some of the actors (especially the male stars) overact bigtime, the brilliant mixture of color and black-and-white photography, the beauty of Jean Harlow in rare color footage, and the unbelievable aerial combat scenes make this an absolute must for any Jean Harlow fan or history buff!"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"bigger, longer, & UNCUT",this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. if u like the show you will LOVE this movie. buy it today!!!!!!
dvd,10 of 11,4.0,Agatha Christie on Acid,"Although Bava said this was his worst film, &quot;Five Dolls...&quot; is now enjoying a much deserved re-appraisal. When I saw a washed-out 35mm print some years ago, I was inclined to agree with the director's opinion, but the DVD release has laid any doubts I may have had to rest. The unusually framed compositions, frenetic zip-panning, intrusive zooms and gaudy colours give the film a psychedelic Eurotrash ambience that is difficult to resist. The unconvincing characterizations and hackneyed plot are lost in a welter of striking incidental details: hundreds of glass baubles rolling down a staircase and into the bloody water of a suicide victim's bathtub, being a particularly impressive example. The kitschy easy-listening soundtrack compliments the visuals perfectly, humorously underscoring the hanging of the corpses in the freezer with childishly sinister fairground music. The English dubbed track seems suffers from occasional irritating crackles, so I suggest you enjoy this garish &quot;10 Little Indians&quot; variant in Italian with English subs. Riddled with loose ends, it's not one of Bava's most substantial movies, but it's by no means devoid of the classic, unusual touches that are associated with his name"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,A message of love,"The Lady Eve is a movie that has a universal appeal.  People all over the world can relate to its message.  In my review I'd like to not only discuss the message of The Lady Eve but to also discuss a form of criticism called ""sociological criticism"" and use it to analyze the movie The Lady Eve.  After discussing the sociological critic's point of view, I will apply its criticism to the movie The Lady Eve and I will discuss whether or not the sociological critic would approve of the content of its text.  This review will allow you to understand sociological criticism and use its criteria to critique any form of text."
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,The Best Version of the Wizard of Oz yet,"Known to all,  this is the story of Dorothy Gale and her  journey to the magical land of Oz. She meets a Scarecrow who needs a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage.  The most popular film of all time , seen by over a billion people. It's timelessness is proof enough of its value . Certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years, but still most beloved. In 1998 rereleased on the big screen: magic. And admittedly the most important film of my life: As a child I was obsessed with the film and only a little less now"
dvd,,5.0,A Calssic,Great movie. I bought it for my young teenage daugther and she loved it
dvd,,5.0,La Ciudad Review,"La ciudad is an extraordinary movie to watch. This movie deals with the life of immigrants and the struggles they must go through in order to survive this cruel life. The movies first starts off at a photo studio where the photographer takes photos of immigrants and as the photographer zooms into the person and takes the photo: the life of the one taking a photo begins to arise. The first part deals with the fact that employers make promises they can't keep as far as the pay they offer and the immigrants have to deal with it because some pay is better than no pay. Sometimes even some pay can cause someone something more valuable, their own lives. The second part deals with being lost in a new place, an immigrant that is. Francisco is in search of his uncle and wanders into a party. At the party he is luck to meet someone from the same town as he and who has a generous heart, who offers him a place to stay. The next morning in order to do a good deed, he goes out to buy food. Francisco goes to the store and upon his return he finds himself lost. Everything seems the same from the outside and he becomes scared but there's nothing  he can do now. Then there's the part where a homeless man tries to enroll his daughter in school and couldn't. The school asked for a receipt or a bill as proof of address but since he didn't have any, they little girl cannot be enrolled even if she does live in the city. Finally, the part where a real crises arises and a mother is pushed to the limits for her child. The employers promised and promised a pay, week after week, but never did. Until a mother brakes down and the rest of her fellow co-workers join into her struggle. All these story in one way or another relate to many if not all immigrants and the struggles they are faced with. In addition to the stories something that is symbolic in the movie is that its in black and white. This makes it clear to the viewers that not everything is ""de color de rosa"". In other words not everything in pretty in color. Plus when people imagine New York, they think glamour, lights and wealth; this movie has none of these things. It truly shows the other side of the story, doesn't it"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Enchanting,"I liked absolutely everything about this movie. There is a certain magic to it. The plot is not so merry, rather sad, but things like that sadly do happen in reality."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"I Dream of Jeannie, Season one",Wonderful shows/episodes.  My favorite sitcom.  I wish that they played I dream of Jeannie on the television at prime time instead of the junk they have now. You do not have to monitor this program.  It is one that almost any age can enjoy.
dvd,1 of 6,5.0,it's about time,It's about time Piper Perabo was in a decent movie since her embarrassing 'Lost and Delirious' ages ago.   Get this movie
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Predictable story line but did not bore me,"It was very predictable ending and not so exciting plots or anything, but was fast pace and entertaining enough for me to watch for 90 minutes. There were a lot of bloody scenes as expected, but it was not about all the actions in the movie,  which kept my interest. It was about trust, loyalty, brotherhood between two men who came from the two different worlds."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,excellent for beginners,"I have been looking for a good beginners pilates tape and this is the one.  It was part of a set that Gaiam makes that included a book, the DVD, and a relaxation CD.  The combination of the book and DVD are absolutely unbeatable!  Both begin by describing the basic tenets of pilates and accompanying exercises.  Then the DVD has  modified beginners, beginners and intermediate to advanced work out levels, where each level  is represented by an individual who is working out simultaneously with the persons representing the other levels; i.e.  three people at once doing different levels.  The modified beginner can be programmed separately from the main work out if desired.  The instructor explains all things in detail in both the book and DVD--perfect for the novice.  (MOre advanced people might get bored, but this is what I was looking for)  The instructor's credentials are listed in the book; she has studied with Romana and thus her lineage is sound.  I think this DVD/book combo is a real find!"
dvd,2 of 14,5.0,It's a question,"Well... It's a great inteligent comedy, which makes enjoy to everyone who whatches it. I'm form Spain and I bought the other three seasons in France. I'll buy it from Amazon, but I would like to know if in England the other seasons offered subtitles in spanish."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A Wonderful Criterion Issue,"I am biased on this film - one of my favorites, right up there with the best of Hitchcock - so I will only say for the movie itself that image and sound meet the high Criterion standard."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A Clockwork Orange,"Novelist Anthony Burgess is obviously a wordsmith of the highest order, and director Stanley Kubrick was able to share that in the dialogue and especially the narrative. The film is itself is one of the most clever and perceptive I've seen, with a sardonic wit, and a sense of irony so sharp it almost hurts. Shockingly violent visuals. Psychedelica gone amok which you must love. This 1971 vision of the world in and my 2005 vision of the world are identical. If you've never seen it, go get it right now. "
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Worth the price for ONE film alone!,"I bought the set, but I don't know whether I'll get around to watching the other 2 films.  ""The Girl Can't Help It"" is undoubtedly the BEST of the early rock 'n' roll films.  Not only is it in color and CinemaScope, but it actually has a decent storyline.  (My other favorite, ""Jamboree,"" has one of the worst storylines I've ever seen, although the music is great.)"
dvd,1 of 13,5.0,funny,this movie is great. the beginning is really funny. This will keep you laughing even when it's over. actors did an amazing job
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Simply Great..... just like Chaplin,"I rented this movie in order to know more about Chaplin for a college work, I did not expect such a masterpiece, it is impossible not to love Chaplin's genius, the autobiographical sense when he preaches to Terry is absolutely convincing because it is real.  The man is simply bigger than life.  This movie is a must have, you will not regret it"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,The Beginning Of An Era,"The first five WrestleMania's for me were the 5 best WrestleMania's as far as in-ring wrestling since that was more of a focus in the early years than storylines & entertainment that it would be in it's later years.  Now I'll be honest, I didn't buy the DVD set (I have the WM 1-13 VHS set from almost 10 years ago) so I don't know what's been edited or changed as far as theme music or anything of that nature."
dvd,7 of 8,4.0,Nice boxset but the packaging! Ugh!,"I won't go on about the contents of this nice boxset as it has all been addressed already, but I thought I should add that upon receiving my shipment today I was dismayed to find all 3 discs rolling around free from their hubs!  This poor packaging virtually guarantees damage to the DVDs...If it wasn't limited I would demand a replacement, but I'm not sending mine back and hope they still have one to replace it.  The replacement would more than likely have the same loose DVD problem anyway.  Boxset 4 stars, packaging (disc protection rated only) 0 stars.  Disappointed"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Superb!,"The actors deliver outstanding performance.  Love the movies that take time to show romantic development between the main characters and this one delivers it...from a woman's perspective.  Strike scenes go on for a while in some parts of the movie, but it is understandable given the period and the emphasis on the pressing issues of that time.  Actually, the theme of the movie is not too far off modern times.  "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Soundtrack CD is available from Amazon.co.uk,"Today I ordered the soundtrack CD for this movie from Amazon.co.uk, the United Kingdom link at the bottom of this page, at a price of 6.80 GBP [Great Britain Pounds aka Pounds Sterling] plus 3.08 GBP for airmail shipping, a total of 9.88 GBP.  They'll have access to your Amazon.com password, shipping address options and credit card info, and the equivalent dollar amount will be charged to your credit card.  Cheaper than from Medieval Baebes, and it's as easy as ordering from Amazon.com!   "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"""Nobody Hurts My Horse""  ~  Life After Aragorn","Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true."
dvd,11 of 56,2.0,Now a longer version of a movie that was too long?,"OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters."

dvd,,4.0,"Did Rowling ""OK"" This? ","I admit this movie is enjoyable. More than that, it was good. If I hadn't read the book first I might have given it 5 stars. But, I READ the book. I memorized almost every word of it, so this movie was...a tad bit unlike the book. I'm not going to say WHY, only that if you've read the books, don't think it strange if, at the end, you find yourself screaming at the credit BASED ON THE NOVEL BY JK ROWLING ""Liars!"""

Can't take my eyes off the pants.  Was this strategically planned?  Hmmmm...leaves little to the imagination.  Besides the pants, there are plenty more reasons to buy this DVD.  "
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,Barberella Psychadela It's Not,"The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Sad to say that it's over.  Steele hoping for more.,"I was a big fan of this series when it first aired in the 80's.

dvd,0 of 3,1.0,Not a comedy,"I found this movie funny in all the wrong places.  It seemed so To me this movie was atrocious. It wasn't particularly funny in any spots, maybe a dry or dark humor. For me the movie was terrible in the acting of the ""young girl"". The actress playing the part I'm sure is a good actress, but the part she had to play seemed lacking to say the least.  After the movie started I had to grab the box cover and check to see if she was playing a mentally retarded person.  I am not here to offend mentally retarded people at all.  Finding out that she wasn't supposed to be mentally retarded I spent the rest of the movie wanting to reach into the television and either shake her or slap her for acting so stupid and clueless.  SPOILER ALERT COMING UP!!!  BEWARE!!!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Sad but a Phenomenal Portrayal,"Mr. Coffey's spiritual intercessions (enhanced by special effects) rivet the flesh with goose bumps. The divine intervention scenes could persuade the hardest atheist. Hanks, as always, is at the top of his game as are the director and producer. The balance of acting is flawless. This movie is tragicaly themed yet inasmuch is designed to heal."
dvd,12 of 15,4.0,The essence of Baker's Doctor,"I bought this particular set a few years ago. I've declined to comment on it as I've continued to gobble up the latest Baker dvds, choosing instead to sit back and enjoy all the informative opinions. Until now, that is. To be honest, I've reached the point where I feel the need to toss my admittedly less informed but equally subjective perspective in the water for fellow Doctor Who fans who have just come upon this set."

It will include a bundle of his most famous and cherished a la The Scorsese Collection and Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection."
dvd,7 of 10,1.0,yuck!,This is straight up porn  and not even good porn either.  I watched this at a friend's house because they nettflicked it without knowing what it was about.  It was a complete waste of an hour and a half of my life
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,a beautiful and funny English classic,"Although it is very funny, and it is about talking animals that drive cars, ""The Wind in the Willows"" is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own.  That would be the Disney cartoon version, not the book, which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group.  It is great to read aloud, however, and for older kids who love nature and humor, ""The Wind in the Willows"" could lead to a lifetime love of books.  ""The Wind in the Willows"" reminds me of the Victorian humor book ""Three Men in a Boat"", because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky English bachelors messing about in boats on the river.  It is funny, with real slapstick comedy, and it is also touching, because it deals with friendship and loyalty, and beautiful, because it is about nature, and love of the countryside and home.      "

dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Excellent,I had no idea how much the Chinese have a grasp in our world or retailing.  The cheap labor markets we have created over there have started a frightening trend in world commerce.  How much does Wal-Mart care about human rights violations in China?  What about the million or so American jobs being lost because of Wal-Mart's slimy practices?   What is happening to our country?   We are selling out to the lowest common denominator and greed not service seems to be the corporation's motivation.   I thought Frontline did a very nice comparison of Rubbermaid vs. Wal-Mart.  Kind of good vs. bad ways to conduct international business.   Wow!

Kathy combines yoga, strength training, and cardio activities into an easy to follow and effective workout.  There is even an option to do the workout with music only (minus the verbal instructions).  As usual, Kathy manages this without sappy pep talk found in other workout programs. "

dvd,39 of 43,2.0,Good idea but nothing new,I love Callanetics (basic?).  I bought the VHS original in 1986 and have used it off and on for almost 20 (!) years.  I recently bought the AM/PM Callanetics and the Stomach Callanetics DVDs but was disappointed to see that essentially there was nothing new in either of the DVDs.  I can recommend original Callanetics but don't waste your money on these retreads. 
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Groundbreaking 90's Medical Drama ,"Okay, I remember in the early 90's when NBC was beating the other networks with hits like Seinfeld, Friends, and this bigtime drama.  Well, this was probably the really big hit drama during the early 90's that no one will forget.  Now, I don't recognize today's ER cast and the people seem more Hollywood than struggling TV actors.  So, this first season really defines the heart of drama on TV which is giving a chance to those struggling TV actors to really shine.  Well, I guess George Clooney is the only one to break out of ER with big success.  The others managed to get out when the scripts ran out of steam after the 4th or 5th season."

dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Disappointing,Hello. This is my review of the motion picture film 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back'.
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,"Good performances, astoundingly bad script","Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane, two otherwise talented actors, completely embarass themselves in this absurd, trite and predictable ""thriller"" that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done. Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all?"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Rattle, Hum & Chill Out","I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now.  Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie.  Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the ""holy lands"" of rock.  If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it.  Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland.  Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written.  By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career.  Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage.  Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride.  It's only rock'n'roll"
dvd,2 of 7,1.0,a no-talent director & no-talent stars make a mockery of johnny cash,"i had given this a second star, but then i thought to myself: why? this movie is abominable. its not just the amateurish performance by joaquin phoenix as johnny cash -- i never thought anyone could sing flatter than the REAL cash -- or the squeaking by reese witherspoon as june carter. its the whole damned show! how often have you ever seen a musical when the songs actually STOPPED the action (i can only think of richard attenboroughs dreadful interpretation of ""a chorus line"")? but the REAL villain here is james mangold, the director who previously gave us that alltime classic ""girl interrupted"". its bad enough that hacks are given millions of dollars to make movies, but i urge you to listen to this guys commentary on the dvd; he is a pretentious jerk who honestly believes he has made a significant work of art. at least the hacks in old hollywood knew they were hacks and were willing to work within their weaknesses, thus often turning out fine professional work. this guy mangold is a moron -- the technique of a buffoon and the limited talent of an ed wood (without the freak show imagination). i cut this down from 2 stars to 1 because i resent that i gave up a few hours of my life to watch this stupid unprofessional ugly movie!"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,great dvd,"good video, good sound, good performance, good value, this is a very good dvd, that I've been waiting for, as a long time van morrison fan.  Every thing is very good about this music dvd, what more can you say.  Its great to have these music dvd's for fans that have enjoyed van's music through the years, but never have had the opportunity to see him perform live.  Maybe if we're lucky, van will do some more music, dvd's. Now eagle vision let's have a Mose Allison music dvd. Van fans buy this DVD you won't be sorry.  I paid $13.99 at circuit city, two DVD's over two hours of music"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,One Time Just Isn't Enough,"This is a movie you'll want to watch over again--a number of times for a number of reasons.  For one, you'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go-round (perhaps the second and third go-round, too, and even beyond).  As the legend goes, with the exception of a few brief, well-timed breathers, director Howard Hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film's sleek 92 minutes, with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once."
dvd,,5.0,Let your imagination fly!,"This is a great kid's movie with a lot of characters and a great story plot. It's a good combination of a musical and a story with good characters and characters that do not make good choices :-) I would suggest not over thinking the story line, it's a kid's movie after all. And no its not all about the flying cars, believe me even a two year old is capable of appreciating more!"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Love this movie,"(4.5/5 stars)  I bought the DVD recently and watched it for the first time ever. I found it to be extraordinary. I cannot speak from any position of authority about Arthurian legend and, as such, cannot attest to its authenticity. As a film, however, this is fantastic entertainment. It has a great story, plenty of action, well-developed characters and perfect pacing. Furthermore, it is an elaborate and quality film that isn't afraid to include elements, such as sex and violence, which might limit its audience. I rather find this surprising, given the magnitude of the film. Here we have a film about a legendary English hero, which would most certainly appeal to the patriotic senses of the country's citizenry; yet, the filmmakers deemed it necessary to tell the tale graphically, thereby all but ensuring it would not be shown in classrooms. They are to be applauded for this decision because it brings the characters to life in a way they would otherwise not be. (In the end, everyone wins because edited versions have in classrooms for years)  Anyway, the acting is first-rate, the costumes (especially the armor) look authentic, the stunts are unbelievable and the direction judicial. The only gripe I have is the DVD quality, which could be a little better. Scenes are jumpy in places and there aren't any worthwhile extras, though overall the picture is decent, it is presented widescreen and the movie is all on one side of the disc. (An unpleasant surprise on some Warner Brothers DVDs has been part one of a movie is on one side and part two on the other, even though the movie itself isn't terribly long. See Amadeus and Goodfellas for examples)  5 stars for the movie, 4 for the DVD."
dvd,,5.0,The best show for 3 year-olds... and good for adults too!,"Backyardigans is a great show.  With completely nonviolent themes, a message of sharing, community and helping others, and great music, this show is perfect for children from 2 to 4 years old.  Adults will also enjoy it for the quality of its music, which is the best I've ever seen it a children's show.  My favourite show of all is the pirate one on this DVD - I'm a sucker for reggae"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Wonderful old fashioned movie,"It is rare to see an old movie that combines good songs, great actors, and a sharp script.  Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, and Rosemary Clooney can brighten anyone's Christmas in this movie.  The plot revolves around Crosby and Kay, old army buddies who make it big in show business after the WWII.  They meet two sisters who are going to a Vermont Inn for a Christmas show.  The Inn is not in good financial shape, and it turns out to be owned by the general who was in charge of Crosby and Kay during WWII.  The musical score is provided by Irving Berlin, and includes such songs as ""Count Your Blessings,"" ""Blue Skies,"" and its namesake, ""White Christmas.""  Most of the dances are well choreographed.  There is one that is in the middle of the movie that isn't entertaning, but overall, the dances are great.  I am a big fan of both Bing Crosby and Danny Kay, so this movie is right up my alley.  If you like light comedy, good music, and great actor chemistry, this is the movie for you"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,still fun after all these years,"ok,sure it was a big wedge of cheese,but at 12 years old this was the coolest thing going. gil gerard was the man and erin gray was the hottest babe around(except when pamela hensley guest starred) and the f/x weren't that bad! the best thing about the show was the costumes(what there was of them for the ladies) and the fun that it brought into the living room every thursday night. when i saw that they had put the whole show out in one package i had to get it,and it's still as much fun as ever."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,One of the very best movies of its kind! Mind-blowing,"Having watched this movie several times, I have to say that it still has the same allure which it had when I first watched it 11 years ago. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action or character driven drama. This is, in my opinion, an all-time classic and a must-own movie -  ranking right up there with the likes of Casablanca, Tombstone or Saving Private Ryan. All of the characters in this movie are first-rate and pull the plot together superbly. The authenticity behind the all of the characters and the scenes is very impressive and adds a great deal of depth to the film. It boasts a fantastic balance between action and character development - with the extra time used to really get you involved with the characters and to see what is driving them as people. Some may say that this movie is too long, but it is time well-spent and can be appreciated by those who like to get involved with the characters and not just watch a storyline unfold. I really appreciate how the movie portrays both the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" - involving both of them in the story. This is truly an epic movie and deserves to be watched by anyone who appreciates a truly great movie. If you watch it once - you will want to see it again"

dvd,7 of 8,4.0,"Very funny comedy, awful video quality","This was Cary Grant's first screwball comedy, and legend has it that the actor was unsure that he could pull off comedy, and asked the director of the film, Leo McCarey, to release him. Well it's good that Grant eventually changed his mind, because he turned out to be one of the silver screen's most gifted comedians. The Awful Truth teams him with the equally gifted Irene Dunne in a ""remarriage comedy"" that I personally like a lot better than ""The Philadelphia Story."""

To get the most benefit from this, I would suggest mastering the basic Callanetics moves, but that is not totally necessary.

dvd,27 of 32,1.0,Meek Machine,"From the people who brought you ""50 First Dates"" comes this synthetic remake of the 1974 Burt Reynolds-Robert Aldrich crowdpleaser. Instead of a hard-edged prison population, we get caricatures and stereotypes. Adam Sandler is far more convincing as Happy Gilmore than Paul ""The Wrecking"" Crewe. Though a brilliant stand-up comedian, Chris Rock has yet to find his cinematic niche. The only bright spots are Reynolds (in the Michael Conrad role) and Courteney Cox"
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,ALL  THIS AND HITLER TOO!!,So where's the DVD??? 
dvd,1 of 6,4.0,Big Meal,"""Big Night"" is a compelling movie with good acting, great direction, a good plot...Wait a minute?!? What plot?  That's the only problem with ""Big Night""; the story doesn't seem to go anywhere.  We find ourselves enjoying the company, starting to feel like regulars at the ristorante but eventually it hits us; What was the point of the movie?  Well, some might say the point can be found in the movie's title.  After all, it is actually a lot of fun to be present at the big party; even if the guest of honor didn't show.  And how about that meal?  Have you ever had a better one?  Or, at least, have you ever seen a better one?"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,"Clue meets ""Bed time stories""","This movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it along with M night shamylans films. this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great. anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress' neve campbell and Denise richards who are both perfect for they're rolls. The whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable. which is unexpected from john Mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film. bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from CSI. The 2 girls have ""it"" in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. I was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet Matt Dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act, and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to. infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool. i do miss neve campbell.. i wish she'd come back to films and it looks like she will. so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9% of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison. Ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts. take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole ""it"" thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of ""cool"" form that shoot, well i did anyway"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The Changeling,Don't Look Back presents a portrait of an artist going through his adolescence about 10 years too late.  For those who have seen No Direction Home and want a more in-depth look at the tumultous Dylan personality of 1965-66 this is the place to look.

dvd,,5.0,A Slightly Altered Version of the Old Fable,"You know the basic story, the practical hardworking pig builds his house with bricks and mortar; one lazy buddy uses sticks and the other uses straw. When the time comes for keeping out the Big Bad Wolf everyone heads to the brick house. It's an old fable and Disney wisely altered the original story where the wolf eats the two lazy pigs and is eaten by the remaining pig after falling into boiling water. "
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,silent version is one of my favorite films,"The four stars goes to the DVD - I give the original silent version of GOld Rush 5 stars, and the re-edited sound-era version 2 stars. This DVD edition lost a star for putting the inferior remake on the first disc. I am mainly writing this review to urge Chaplin newcomers, or anyone for that matter, to watch the original 1925 version first. The re-release has highly distracting and tedious narration throughout the entire film, as all the intertitles have been deleted. At times this narration comes across as bad dubbing, as the words are very roughly synced up with characters talking on the screen. Even though Chaplin himself did the narration, the effect is very cheesy and amaturish, and makes the film MUCH more dated, while taking away much of the emotional effect of the original film. I also prefer the slightly longer, more dramatic 1925 edit, and the original ending, which is just perfect. It seems like the 1942 re-release was more of a gimmick and a chance to make an extra buck than a serious artistic endeavor (kind of like the Star Wars ""special editions""). Some would say that at least the re-release had Chaplin's own score. However I think the piano score for the silent version is excellent, despite reviews here to the contrary. First off, the score is based on the original cue sheets, so it is quite authentic to the time. It is played excellently, is well recorded, and is very fitting to the overall mood of the film"
dvd,4 of 4,1.0,Mediocre writing & direction,"I like romantic comedies in general, even some that I recognize as being formulaic, but I didn't like this movie.  The weaknesses were immediately apparent--awkward dialogue, lack of visual style--but I hoped the movie would overcome its faults.  It didn't.  Unlike, for example, Wedding for Bella, which had some similar shortcomings and obvious outcomes, this movie never made me care about the lead characters--they were two-dimensional sketches rather than fleshed-out characters.  I liked Amy Jo Johnson, although being a 30-year-old playing ""the teenager"" suggests a reason for her undistinguished career, and I liked Liz Vassey who was also relaxed in her character rather than awkwardly acting a part.  Otherwise, nothing to see here. Move along"
dvd,,5.0,Wonderfully Kind.,"I just love John Hughes Romantic Comedies of the 80's. It gave the middle class boy or girl in the growing decadeance of the era with big money and big hair a chance to shine. A butch girl played by Mary Stuart Masterson hangs out with her best buddy ( Eric Stolz) and his infatuation for the it girl (Lea Thompson) who is going out with the rich and popular it boy (Craig Sheffer)the catch is the character played by Mary Stuart Masterson is not a dyke but much in love with her best friend. Cute movie , Cute ending. Sweet and Simple"

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Great family entertainment,"We subsribed to Deja View on our cable network and my son (who's 10)seen a couple episodes of of Gilligan's Island. He thought it was such a great show, I surprised him by buying the first season. Now that's our evening entertainment, after supper we watch one or two shows before bed. He's 10 and thinks it's so much better than most of the shows on right now. I think he enjoys singing the theme as much as watching the show. It's great for myself as a parent to know they're watching something that's meant for family viewing. I have to admit I also enjoy watching the old shows - it's like comfort food"

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Two movies and a debasement,"I'm a newcomer to Buster Keaton's films.  I've heard of him since I was a kid, but I never actually watched his films until a couple months ago.  I was a complete idiot to wait this long.  The Cameraman is one of the funniest and most charming movies I have ever seen.  Spite Marriage is much better than many of the reviewers are giving it credit for.  They're probably comparing it to other Keaton films.  I haven't seen all that many yet, so I can't do that.  I can tell you it is much funnier than any comedy that any major film studio will secrete this year.  Or next year.  You get the idea."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Among the Top Comedies on My List,"This one has it all - an inspired script (Lady Fanny of Omaha?) based on a clever premise, an opportunity for Steve Martin to work a full range of schticks (including a very earnest, ""don't pity me, you don't have to do that"" ruse), a richly-photographed Riviera backdrop and a stylish jazz violin score by the late Miles Goodman. Of special note is Michael Caine's wonderful man-about-town, a role that would have been tailor-made (pun intended) for the late David Niven and executed to perfection by Caine, who is at the top of his form here. Caine and Martin playing cat-and-mouse with one another is great fun. And, oh yes, there's that over-the-top segment about Ruprecht that a friend and I have bantered about for years."
dvd,,4.0,A Decent Compilation,"I am a very big Robert De Niro fan.  This has some of his greatest roles, but I strongly think that they should have replaced the Bronx Tale with Taxi Driver.  Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen, this collection shows us why"

I strongly sudgest this movie for anyone who has even a spark of intrest in FFVII"
dvd,4 of 12,2.0,A has-been,"The reviewers here are rating the performer, not the show. Stritch looks haggard, sings horribly, and most of her stories are only interesting to her. A dreadful performance all around"
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Good disaster movie,"What I thought would be a another B movie turned out to be a good action flick.  Good actors Annabella Sciorra, Michael Biehn and quite a few other good tv actors.  Worth the money and time to see it. Characters were developed and you knew who they were and what purpose they served.  Good plot, even kept the interest of my grandchildren.  Can't find too many directors or producers that can make an interesting plot and keep it moving.  Dr. Lily McKee played by Annabelle Sciorra discovers a massive asteriod hurtling towards the earth and tries to get Feds to help and believe her. She notifies FEMA in comes Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn) he plays his role well -- better than Annablle Sciorra, sometimes she looks like she is confused...but carries her role well.  Good flick I think you'll enjoy. Good special effects. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Thanks Hallmark,"Thanks Hallmark...for bringing back family movies.  From Straight from the Heart (Teri Polo and Andrew McCarthy are great!) to the Love Comes Softly Series (Dale Midkiff is a great new actor!) I am truly enjoying TV again.  Straight from the Heart is a lovely film, with lovely actors and beautiful scenery! There is a song during the wedding scene with the lyrics ""Nobody rides in a cow girl rodeo unless they have their blue jeans on...."" that I would like to know the name of the song and artist.  I would recommend the movie....it's sweet and very enjoyable"
dvd,,4.0,Basketball drills,"I had heard that the movie had some good drills that my daughter might benefit from.  The dribbling work the actor does is amazing, but most of these things can be done with practice.  My daughter is now proficient at the drills we chose to work on.  She made the Varsity as a freshman a few days ago.  The story is a good one.   It goes into some of the hardships he faced as a kid, but not some of the tougher things he faced as an adult.  It is definitely a family movie"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,"The ""Joshua Tour"" Movie","While the album contains some tracks that are not present in this movie which document to 'capture the moment of the making of an album' as stated by the band members, while the band goes on with their American tour in support for their epic album THE JOSHUA TREE Lp- the movie did succeed in capturing the essence of the band in that period, if that is indeed the purpose for the making of this flick (and to cash in some profit at the same time, matter-o'factly, of course). Consisting of behind-the-scenes backstage interviews, sessions, rehearsals, and concert footages - this documentary feature also contain certain portions that are not included in the companion 2 Lp set:"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Great workout to get back in shape,"This is a great workout DVD and very easy to follow.  I've pretty much never exercised prior to having my baby (had a slender build), but a couple months after giving birth i found myself very anxious to lose all those extra pounds.

dvd,2 of 4,4.0,Bookends,"Grab a copy of this movie and watch it as a double feature with the current ""Out of Time.""  Denzel Washington fans will argue until the cows come home over which is the better performance, but the two films show Washington's mastery of his art.  While Quinn is smooth but pure, Denzel's Chief in Out of Time is like a Quinn gone a little soft and ripe in the tropical sun, a man of integrity who has faced one too many temptations in a sordid and complicated world.  I loved the noir feel of the first 7/8 of Out of Time and was annoyed at the lapse into Hollywood at the end, but Washington makes the character so attractive, that you wish him the best.  Check it out"
dvd,,5.0, My personal Merchant Ivory favourite,    
dvd,0 of 5,5.0,about the movie kickboxer........,Thiis story is basically how Jean Claude Van Damme start his kickboxing competition career and at the same time to take revenge for his brother's paralysis due to Tung Po's killer fight. The fighting/action scenes are numerous which I could say is very nice (what I mean is full R movie unlike lionsheart which the fighting/action scenes are rather soft in nature). This movie/film is not suitable for the underaged as the action is using full damaging/smashing forces. A good recommendation foor those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film. 
dvd,,4.0,Potty Power - for boys and girls,"Not a bad short movie to get your little one started with potty training, particularly if you only have one child, which is our case.  Made our little guy feel that he was not alone going through this process and made it a little more fun"

If you enjoy a whole DVD of a band complaining about how hard it is to be on the road and singing the same songs every night-then go for it! They seem like a bunch of pretentious jerks-this did not help their image. I know its so tough touring the world playing the  music you love, but don't make a whole dvd devoted to your whining...yuck again"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,superior rock film,"A thought came to me that if I were to put on a very limited showing of rock/pop films it might include The Beatles' Hard Day's Night, The Band's Last Waltz, then I thought why not this one to help encapsulate the feeling of the late 1970s.  Filmed fantastically by Hallstrom (a major motion picture director ever since), with split screens and the whole thing, puts the viewer into the middle of the frenzy, the huge concerts, touring/meet-and-greet schedule, maniacal fans, etc.  The concert footage is terrific, sound is excellent, plus the small handful of Australian actors are very memorable.  I come across rock history buffs and musicians who still don't get the whole ABBA thing (this is coming from a guy who also listens to Sonic Youth, by the way), but perhaps this film will do it.  Glad to see this on DVD - have been waiting a long time.  Trust me, the energy in this is amazing"
dvd,,5.0,The best of the best!!!,"Just saw this movie,for the first time, two weeks ago and have seen it at least a dozen times since then and still counting! This is definitely and absolutely an Oscar winner!  Diane Keaton was more than perfect for this role!!!  More power to her!  Hope she makes a lot more movies.  Can't seem to get enough of her movies"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Best I've Seen for Speech Development!!!,"Just purchased the Baby Babble DVD this past week for our 15-month son who hasn't quite figured out the concept of ""talking"" yet.  He's been pretty content to make noises to get attention, but always the same ""agggh"" or ""dah dah dah"" (though w/different tones depending upon what he wants).  He loves this DVD, and stares with smiles, interest & fascination. The first night, he started trying new sounds -- trying to roll his tongue over & over to make an ""L"" sound. It was so amazing.  The producers here obviously know what they're doing when it comes to helping children with the concept of SPEECH, and making sounds for communication.  It seemed a bit corny at first, but really turned out to be perfect.  I wish there were more.  The tips at the end for parents & caregivers were right on target as well."
dvd,7 of 10,2.0,"The Story Of Rubin Carter, According To Rubin Carter","The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter."
dvd,1 of 3,1.0,Made-for-TV Rubbish,"Combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial (lots of guitars and vibraphones, let's call it ""Rock On with NAWSA""), this film tells the viewer much more about Hollywood femnists' perceptions of the past, than it does about the past itself. All decked out in Edwardian costumes, the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips, all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the Progressive Era. These scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman, for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement, yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points, she too will take up the banner and join the NAWSA crusade. Perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when Alice told a Washington Post reporter: ""I'm having dinner with Helen Keller."" The reporter, ""Don't stare, she hates that."""
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,A great anime!,At first glance it seems like the movie isn't worth what little money you paid for it. The characters (on the back of the box) looks like something out of the 80s and the beginning is just so unfocused and slow. You literally have no idea what's going on. 
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Too sophisticated to just be considered a ""kid's film""","When I went into this film, I expected to like it.  I vaguely remembered seeing on TV one time and enjoying it.  However, I did expect a few dated elements.  The most obvious of these would be the casting of a Caucasian to play an Asian character."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,best teen movie of the 90's,"I love Clueless. It's an amazing movie based on spoiled rich kids. The main character is Cher( silverstone), who likes to help out others in the school and likes to get her way. Dion is the funniest character of them all. I like her sense of humor. "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Please tip your waitress,"This movie is classic.  What a perfect and stereotypical portrayal of servers in large cities.  There's a chain restaurant near me which is a perfect match for this movie.  Kids working in any food service job play games, and it's fun while you do it and you're young.  Then you grow up and think twice about complaing to your waiter.  "
dvd,,5.0,Recommended,"I have all 5 seasons of ""Magnum P.I."" After watching 5 episodes, this season seems the most highly developed one. Also, it's on single-sided discs, which may avoid the problems that made two episodes unplayable in my copy of Season 4"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"The dialogue is witty, the music score is beatiful, and the characters are carefully crafted","I came across this movie randomly, seeing that it was apart of the Criterion Collection Dynasty I could not resist such an interesting cover. Fortunately, I was not at all dissapointed, possibly the most wittiest and cunning dialogue I had ever encountered in a film. The protagonist, Johnny, (David Thewlis) a London drifter meanders his way through the streets of London meeting new people on all levels of society, people on the fringe of society, the mentally unstable, outcasts, and insecure people, or the ""Insecurity Guard."" Johnny is such a well crafted character that at some points in the film he doesn't even have to speak to understand him. His distorted facial expressions are enough to give you a sense of familiarty with him. He is philosphical, promiscuous, religious and dark at some points. Although he speaks rapidly with a soft subtle British Accent, he is very direct and get his point across. The music score is extremley siginifcant to the film, it is as though you are viewing a long poem, Johnny's dialogue is almost syncranized with the music. The humor could not be more well timed as Johnny irritates, humors, and abuses anybody who cares for him. What really triggered my desire for this film was not only Johnny but the way he interacts with society. He listens and refutes the various people he meets. I strongly reccomend this film for fans of clever dialogue and extrodinary characters. The Acting is purely stunning by the whole cast, but Johnny will require more attention. The Criterion Collection has not dissapointed me yet as they continue to celebrate classic and contemporary films. The Transfer and Music score are magnificent not too mention insightful interviews with film critics and the ever so talented direcotr Mike Leigh. Deff. an underrated film."
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,The Americanization of Emily,"Written by the gifted Paddy Chayefsky, this is one of the sharper anti-war satires ever made. Both leads are solid, with Andrews impressive in her first non-singing role. Veteran Douglas and James Coburn (as Charlies womanizing fellow officer) almost steal the movie, however. A touching and engrossing film, with something to say"

dvd,4 of 19,1.0,Hold your nose,"I thought Colin was sleeping at first. I didn't realize he was ""acting sensitive"".  It would be more interesting to watch paint dry, than this slow, boring, pointless movie.  So, his friend is gay, big suprise, and Colin movies to New York to live with him and kooky girl.  Who ever thought Robin Wright could look ugly?  She used to be an attractive girl, I guess living with Sean Penn must be very stressful.  You probably guessed the plot - kooky girl really loves gay friend, but Colin shows up and she sleeps with him gets preggy and they all move to hooterville and live the ""unconventional life"" thats even more boring than living in the ""burbs"".  They are the most conventional ""unconventional"" bores of all time.  Either overdose on black coffee or skip this one.  For extreme Colin fans only.  Enjoy! "
dvd,2 of 11,4.0,Hilarious movie!,"Truly a classic, though beware of nudity (there's a naked Graham Chapman for a brief moment!"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Outwit. Outplay. Outlast.,"(3.5/5 stars) Listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly, ashen-faced with blank stares; where is the horror in that? Sounds like a typical Sunday afternoon at the mall to me. In fact, Dawn of the Dead (1978) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film. More or less picking up where ""Night of the Living Dead"" left off, zombies are on the hunt for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don't bring much in the way of strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they weren't so tenacious. The four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the TV of bombing areas of high zombie concentration. They have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate have in store for them? ""The Night of the Living Dead"" took place, obviously, at night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop. It was also in black and white, which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make-up. This is not the case with ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which is in color and takes place during daylight. The ""zombies"" are people dressed as they normally would, but with their faces painted grey. The result is anything but scary. Tom Savini's effects are hit and miss, though always disgusting. Nonetheless, this is a decent film that features some above-par acting and a decent script. The Anchor Bay Divimax DVD is also noteworthy, with a clean transfer and DTS sound mix. An extra � star for the effort."
dvd,43 of 47,5.0,Heritage - Civilization and the Jews  DVD,"WOW!  This is an incredible set to have.  The DVD is a reprint from a PBS special in 1984 (Peabody winner, at that).  Abba Eban is an incredible, captivating speaker.  My only problem is that there is so much information, I can only watch about two hours at a time.  This is a must have whether you are Jewish or not.  The series pulls together world history unlike any class I took in college.  The addition of the DVD-Rom with tons of maps, historical documents, and video clips is awesome.  It has answered most of the questions I had, and let me view a moving graphical history by sliding the scroll bar.  Super buy for a history buff"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Deep,"There is lot's of issues on this season that make being a gay a lot more easier. I like the thing about gay parenting, because I am gay, and will one day be a father. The gay football player (played by Alec McClure), was wonderful. Esera Tuaolo was one of the very few NFL players to come out. So it was nice for this show to a have a situation like that. Alec was also sexy as hell, which I loved. "
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,One of my Favorites,"Many words come to mind as I reflect on this amazing series; innocence lost, sacrifice, redemption, friendship, love, survival. All these things and more are wrapped nicely into this moving piece of work from Akitar� Daichi. ""Now and Then, Here and There"" grabs you from the very start and doesn't let go until its over. Very few anime's have been able to do that for me. The series is uplifting at times and very sad at others. The main characters sheer will to survive and help others tells us so much about him. He is willing to go the extra mile to make sure those around him continue to live and persevere."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Fun Film - Widescreen DVD from Japan,"I recently picked up this film after not having seen it in years.  It turned out to be as fun as I remembered; one of Van Damme's best.  The DVD I bought is a budget priced release from Japan.  The print looks nice and is presented in anamorphic widescreen!!  If you're tired of waiting for Paramount to issue a widescreen version in the U.S./Canada, it might be worth your while to pick up a region free DVD player.  They can be had for $50 or so these days. "
dvd,,4.0,A Masterfully Luscious Homage !,"Brian De Palma's ""Dressed To Kill"" is a stunningly beautiful homage to his most obviouse influence in meastro Alfred Hitchcock. True film junkies will find themselves picking there jaws up off the floor after witnessing the mezmorising Hitchcockian cinematogrophy that runs rampid throughout this masterful thriller. I will never fault a Director for displaying his biggest influences especially when they're of the likes of one of the four fathers of great cinema/film making. I can't say enough about this film so I'm just going to end this review now by saying that I truly am inlove with it.   "

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"Provoking and Haunting, but Wonderful","Powerful, provoking film full of raw emotions. The story plods along very slowly and what it lacks in plot it more then makes up for in splendid acting and story telling. You will be a better person for having watched it."
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,It's funny precisely because it's so incredibly ridiculous,"Gilligan's Island has often been an object of ridicule for both professional critics and self-annointed intellectuals alike, most of whom point out the various implausibilities in the show (i.e., the Professor is an ""idiot"" because he can cause nuclear fission using coconuts but can't build a raft, the unliklihood of the Howells taking a ""three hour tour"" on an obviously inexpensive charter boat, let alone taking along three season's worth of wardrobe and costumes with them, ad nauseum), but chances are these same critics have also seen many -- if not all -- the show's episodes, and have enjoyed at least a few guilty laughs for their trouble. "
dvd,4 of 7,1.0,I'm just glad I didn't actually PAY to watch this!,"We checked this out from the library a couple of years ago.  It really was torture to watch.  The acting was terrible, the costumes were even worse.  I don't know whether to say it was really funny or really sad, because all in all it was a pretty pathetic production.  Not one of BBC's better efforts"

dvd,,4.0,Don't act surprised...,"It's a good movie, you have action, romance and a twist of science fiction. All of these are just winner ingredients, in this particular case the picture has a favorable outcome and it serves it's primary purpose: entertain. Don't look forward to the probable appearance of a Big price, a BIG nomination, or somthing like that...expect FUN, and a GREAT time, thats all.     "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Enough twists to keep you entertained,"While not on the level of ""The Interpreter"" in terms of plot depth and character development, ""Cellular"" delivers what it says it will: a fast paced, tense thriller that will please most people. The plot is complex enough to keep the watcher guessing what exactly will happen and not bore the audience. There are a number of tense scenes that add to the overall suspense and thrill of the movie. If you're in the mood for a fast paced thriller this will not disapoint you."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Not Tom Jones,"A quick correction to the two reviewers who mentioned the end title theme was sung by Tom Jones. They are incorrect, the singer was Tony Christie (clearly stated in the credits) and he had a minor hit from this song in the 70's. Check Wikipedia for an overview of his career"

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Poirot,"This is fantastic series.  I love it!  Interesting characters and the British do a great job with mysteries.  David Suchet does Poirot so well you can't imagine anyone else doing it (like Jeremy Brett is the only one who can play Sherlock Holmes for me).  I hope production companies will do more series like along these lines (Poirot, Marple, Holmes, Nero Wolfe, etc.)"
dvd,16 of 17,4.0,"Reeeealy close, but not quite a cigar","First off, Keaton is one of the great artists of all times, and it's a joy to have such a complete collection of his silent work. (His last few silents, The Cameraman and Spite Marriage, and his sound films are a far cry from Keaton's best, and I suggest leaving them alone unless you're the absolute completist.) Kino has done a superb job on the features, restoring them to the best they've looked in decades and adding funny, unobtrusive musical scores. A perfect 5 here."
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,Pittsburgh PA,"DONT listen to that silly man "" a viewer"" He doesnt know a thing. You can watch this extrodinary film on DVD and reap the hearty rewards of laughter and happiness. Or you can watch a VHS and dial up the internet while you toast your snax on a fire. In other words....The dvd is far better then any old VHS. This DVD is the best. Just believe me. You will thank me later. And see Spamalot too"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Marissa's Gone...But Some of Her Best Moments Will Be Remembered On The First Season,"Yes, it happened. Marissa finally attracted a little too much boy drama and it finally ended her on the OC. (Fans of the OC are actually quite upset at this and even are making 'Save Marissa' web sites all over- just Google Save Marissa and you'll see!) But the point is- she's gone. Yet after watching last season and realizing the amazing four would only be the amazing three now, I started missing Marissa. She was annoying at times oh yes, but her character was a big part of the show, and she did bring a lot of drama to the show that kept us watching. Without her who knows what will happen now. We'll have to see next time OC comes on, but I bought Season One to remember some of her best moments on the show. "
dvd,,4.0,Next of Kin,"Damn good movie and entertaining, too.  Being a Kentuckian, I liked how it showed the differences of the eastern Kentucky mountain people's environment, lifestyles, and their beliefs, which is still carried on to this very day, in  contrast to the big city's(Chicago)smug, fast-paced attitude. The guy traveling in a converted school bus full of snakes was a bit hard to swallow, and how Liam Neeson's character could find his way around Chicago, and never having been there, is a mystery to me. Yes, there are many bow hunters in Kentucky!!  They have a special time during deer hunting strictly for bow.  And, yes, they are good with them! But, the movie as a whole is fun to watch with a big bowl of popcorn.  Might not be suitable for small children due to language and violence"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Very Entertaining and Somewhat Educational,"JURASSIC PARK is a great movie that comes along once a generation. What's to criticize?... Nothing! THE LOST WORLD received mostly good reviews. I personally liked it as much if not better than the first. It had a great story with some new and returning dinosaurs along with the ""T-Rex in San Francisco"" which is definately a memorable scene of the movie. JURASSICK PARK 3 is the misfit of the trilogy. I liked the third installment but I must agree with the many viewers who felt that the length of the movie was cut too short. Plus, the action packed violence and intensity is missing from the first two movies. On a positive note, adding new and intelligent dinosaurs worked out good even if the intelligence level does seem a bit much. While JURASSICK PARK 3 leaves more to be desired, the trilogy is overall good. I enjoy these movies even more watching them in the order of Jurassick Park 1, 3, and 2. Try me on this one! I hope Jurassick Park 4 is in the works"

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Welcome to the Alternate Universe of PKDick,"The author was not your classic sci-fi story teller. He streched the boundaries of the genre with each new publication and it is a shame that he was not as popular living as he is now.  His tales had a spooky, this is not happening, quality that is only rarely visible on film.  The movie is based on the novel with some cinematic licenses thrown in."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A modern masterpiece,"MULHOLLAND DRIVE is one of the greatest movies of the last 30 years. Utterly compelling. First time I watched it, mesmerized but without really understanding it, the whole audience at the movie theater was speechless at the end, completely blown away. Naomi Watts gives one of the greatest performances of all time. Her character goes through the most amazing changes, all utterly convincing. Her ""movie audition"" is especially stunning. MULHOLLAND DRIVE is confusing the first time through, but after watching it a couple of times it all comes together. Unlike, for example, LOST HIGHWAY, this is a completely realistic plot, with no supernatural or unexplainable elements. Originally this was a pilot for a TV show a la Twin Peaks. Lynch then changed it to make it a movie, so there are some loose ends. There are also some lengthly dream sequences (Lynch gives only subtle clues to tell us that what's dream and real, but there are clues, and the distinction is clear), some flashbacks which are out of order, and some psychotic delusions presented from the perspective of the psychotic person. Nevertheless, the events are all completely possible (dreams do happen, people are subject to psychotic delusions, and memories or flashbacks can happen out of order), even plausible. Lynch gives us a terrifying look into the human psyche"

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Unforgettable and wonderful,"I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it.  Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father.  I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon).  A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film.  Rings true to life.  They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame"

These raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of ""love."" Risk becomes only the next step. Susan Sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength, courage, wit and willingness to go up against the BIG, tough bad guys with all the money and power. Tommy Lee Jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power ""fools."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,OUT OF THE SHADOWS,"After the Individual Eleven committed ritual suicide on a skyscraper roof last volume, Section 9 is left with the only one of the members that did not submit to the killing directive. He's the same guy that tried to kill the Prime Minister and his name is Kuze. He has a custom made cyborg body that makes him almost invulnerable to weapons or injury. He also has a very distinctive face, one so distinct that there's only one person in the country that could make it, but he's been killed by....Paz??!!  This is just the beginning of Volume 4's focus on the supporting cast, allowing background characters to receive the main focus. Episode 14 is about Saito's first encounter with the Major many years ago when they were on opposite sides of a war. Episode 15 concerns the Tachikoma's creator as he decides to flee to another country, taking his technological expertise with him. It's up to Section 9 to capture him before that happens, but along the way, the Tachikomas begin to question their own individuality and their own feelings(?) about their dad. The last episode brings Kuze's past to light as we get a glimpse of the man behind the mask...literally. "

Also the ""Working With A Master"" featurette has very funny and interesting interviews with Don Rickles (hysterical), Rick Baker, Forrest J.

They were a bit raw, but what they lacked in polish they made up for in sincerity and harmony. Some people want to call them the next Bob & Ray or Rowan & Martin or even Goldberg/Williams/Crystal. I say peeshaw! Bob has more talent in his ankle (left) than all of those jerks combined. And for David (not Dave), he's an example of how to live your life even when your body is being ravaged by HPV. I hope Lifetime will listen to its viewers and bring this back"

Raised in poverty and fed by his mother's dreams of regaining standing within the family, Price grows up with the goal of being recognized as a rightful heir.  That dream gradually morphs into a desire for revenge, and Price, who has become the epitome of a bight, cultured, English gentleman, begins doing away with everyone between him and the title.  There are drownings, explosions, poisonings, and deceit aplenty."

dvd,10 of 10,5.0,Snap shot: 1989ish,"For better or worse, this film really represents an era, particularly in So Cal.  This film is superficial but bright and smart... and has VERY bright colors -- like a 90 minute Starburst commercial.  The entire look, in every nook and cranny, is eighties glitzy-junk new wave excess taken to the extreme.  And then grunge (Seattle, Nirvana, Clinton:-) put an end to it all, sort of.  But while it lasted, the end of the eighties ($ boomtime for So Cal) is shown here in all its glory:  Yuppiedom, lots of gadgets, almost disposable clothes, accesories to the max, disposable pop-culture references, and big-haired beautiful women.  Julie Brown epitomizes all of the above with a postmodern wink.  She is the heart here... while Geena Davis is the straight person, properly vacant, wandering through this neon world.  As so many reviewers wrote, the Julie Brown musical numbers are real standouts.  And Geena's &quot;Ground That You Walk On&quot; is great too.  Highly recommended time capsule.  (Compare this film to 1980ish &quot;Xanadu,&quot; where lots of this glitz was in its infancy, more serious and innocent)"

dvd,5 of 10,4.0,OK Populist Drama,"""Meet John Doe"" is an engaging populist drama with some elements of screwball comedy, but it lacks the resonance of director Frank Capra's ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"".  Now Capra is not the most subtle of directors but he is really wearing his sentiments on his sleeve here.  Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck are fine here but not outstanding.  Walter Brennan is, well, Walter Brennan.  The presence of Edward Arnold as the newspaper magnate with political ambitions telegraphs the ominous direction the film's story is going to go.  I kept thinking that what if an actor with a little more subtlety who doesn't wear the black hat so prominently was cast instead, like say, Claude Rains.  I also thought to myself while watching this how the Coen brothers were influenced to some degree by Capra in films like ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"".  This is a good film but not one of Capra's best"
dvd,,5.0,strong set from great director,This is  a first-rate box set of movies from Warner Brothers.  All four titles are well worth seeing and the supplementary material is very well done.  I am very pleased with this collection and highly reccomend it
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,WONDERFUL,"this movie is INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL. ralph fiennes is just UNBELIEVABLE. and the rest of the cast, too, is AMAZING. the plotline itself is beautiful and passionate. each second of the three-hour movie was pleasant (i didn't even believe that was possible before. out of africa, for example, was torture). if you're looking for an experience rather than just a movie, this film will do that. the cast and story provide that. it's still playing in my head. it has changed me, even if a little. every great piece of art has that effect"
dvd,7 of 9,4.0,ABRAHAM FONDA,"At 34, Henry Fonda was a most inspired choice for playing the title role in YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.    A much simplified film,  the movie very sensibly confines itself to what is implied in its title -- the period when he was becoming enough of a local dignitary to be called something other that plain old &quot;Abe&quot; yet before he reached - even in the eyes of his admirers - what could be called maturity.   John Ford couldn't have his Dublin fog, he could have torch-lights and misty river vistas to suit his taste for the picturesque.  His lovely outdoor scenes do a lot to create a young America for young Mr. Lincoln to live in.  The film would have been improved by more roughness and uncouthness.  The log cabin where the Clays lived, the people listening to the campaign speeches at the country store, the country people thronging into Springfield for the parade day, are all too neat and gentle to prepare for the free-and-easy courtroom scene, which, mild though it probably is in comparison with the realities of Illinois in the 1830's seems over-done and played for laughs because the key for behaviour of these rough folks who have hardly emerged from the backwoods stage has not  yet been set.    This refining has gone a bit into the portrayal of Lincoln himself.  Nature did a lot to make Hank Fonda a natural choice for the part--his lankiness, his laziness, his drawl, so that a crafty touch from the make-up man was enough to re-create any number of the younger Lincoln portraits.  (The camera-man was fatally conscious of this--whevever Mr. Fonda got into a typical Linconesque pose, the camera lingered and lingered over it!).  The other folk are largely background, some of them vivid and colourful, some of them - like Stephen Douglas  - pure phoney.  The usually excellent Alice Brady didn't convince us too well that she was a log-cabin person (Abigail Clay); the clothes worn by the Clays weren't lived in - they were from the wardrobe department and, therefore brought no magic with them.  All in all, however, its a lovely, picturesque, if a little inaccurately done film which was done with the very best of intentions"
dvd,,4.0,As Good As They Say!,"Let me start off by saying that I think Hugh Grant is drop-dead gorgeous. I would watch any movie with him in it. This is one of his best films, if not the best. It's funny without being desperate and touching without being depressing. The only thing I would change about it is the casting of Andie McDowell. She delivers her lines so poorly that it's distracting. If it weren't for her ""performance"", I might would have given this film five stars. Luckily, she doesn't have THAT many lines for a ""lead"" character. I've read that Four Weddings and a Funeral is the highest grossing British film ever and I can see why"

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,NYC 5th-Graders Have Fun & Strive for Excellence on the Dance Floor.,"In 1994, the American Ballroom Theater introduced a ballroom dance program to 5th-graders in two New York City schools. By the time ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" was made a decade later, 6,000 5th-graders in more than 60 New York City schools take the 10-week ballroom dancing course each year, culminating in a city-wide competition. Director Marilyn Agrelo and screenwriter Amy Sewell focus on ballroom dance students at 3 New York elementary schools, following their progress from 8 weeks before the competition begins until the citywide Final, where teams who have won quarterfinal and semifinal rounds will vie for Gold, and one team will win the huge Challenge Trophy. The schools are: P.S.115 in Washington Heights, P.S. 150 in Tribeca, and P.S. 112 in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst neighborhood. The filmmakers may have chosen these schools for their disparate demographics. The school in Washington Heights is populated by the children of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, 97% of whom live at or below the poverty level. Bensonhurst is working class. And Tribeca is more affluent."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,The Folksmen Rule!!!,"When Chevy Chase came back from Hollywood to host SNL in its second season, the other SNLers were mad at him. (He was the only SNL player with a one-year contract, while the rest were contracted/stuck for five years). Bill Murray represented his SNL crew, and got into a shoving match with Chase.  As they were pulled apart, Murray pointed and yelled, ""Medium talent!  Medium talent!""  (""Live from New York"" book). That may or may not be a fair assessment of Chase.  But it *is* fair to say that the stars of A Mighty Wind are extra large talents!  They act!  They sing!  They play instruments!  They create real characters!  They improv! They're Collegiate!     "
dvd,2 of 8,1.0,Spielbergs' worst?,"Well, it didn't appeal to me personally -the story, the characters, no, usually I am such a big fan of Steven Spielbergs' various masterpieces, and despite ""Always"" I'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies, and so well. Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindlers' List, Minority Report -you name it! The man is a genious, no argue there -but this movie simply hasn't got the touch nor the style"
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,Great Movie!,This was an all time favorite of ours.  The perfect cast for a great movie
dvd,,5.0,Fascinating,It was interesting to watch how these people survived in such appalling conditions. I think they lied to themselves to deal with it (as the end of the film tends to prove my belief) but I admired their fortitude. Nobody should have to live in such a bleak environment
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The Little Rascals,"What a great movie!  It has laughter, drama and a great moral to the story.  Great for people of all ages young and old, everyone will get the meaning of true friendship after watching this movie.  I totally recommend watching it"
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,Lyncherei,"About as comprehensible as one expects a David Lynch movie to be, but not completely unwatchable (I finsihed it!)."
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,This is for the entire show,"Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,I'm not even supposed to be here today,"I watched this one after I'd seen all of Kevin Smith's other films,so I caught the humor pretty quickly.I loved the fact that these two had such a blatant disregard for their customers and got to act however they wanted.It also occured to me that the whole film was in black and white.I loved it anyway.Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson were quite experienced for their first time out.Escapade after escapade ensues as these two store clerks get wrapped up in just about every misfortune you can think of.Clerks rocks"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Charlie Dujic rocks,"I was really happy to see that Charlie Dujic finally put out a video!  His work is just amazing, and now his tips are available to everyone, not just the rich and famous.."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,The LAW's life as 'law',"This is a harsh film made up of several fractured stories that eventually come all together in showing the life at the fringes of the Iranian society. It's about women, as ever culpable gender, walking the dreary space they could carve around, and temporarily away from, the LAW. These women's short lives on screen, though different, have a lot in common in their moth-like gyrations. Additionally noteworthy are the few powerful sketches of men as accomplices, LAW enforcers, women abusers, LAW distorters (i.e. 'law' abiders). The viewer's rage is well controlled; all the tragic becomes chronic sadness. Iranian expats' opinions would be more than welcome! Just above mediocre transfer on DVD"
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Andrew Davies does it again!,"As he showed with his masterful handling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Andrew Davies can take a long character novel and make it fascinating, even if five hours long. The acting is superb. Justine Waddell as Molly is very pretty in a quiet way, but outshone (as she should by) by Keeley Hawes as the charming and fascinating Cynthia. Keeley Hawes manages to capture Cynthia's character. She is full of pretty ways, and so honest, that we like her in spite of ourselves. Tom Hollander is excellent as the slightly weak Osborne, and so is Michael Gambon as his father. This is the most Austen-like of Gaskell's books in style, and somewhat resembles Mansfield Park in plot. But what makes Gaskell special is her characters, all varied, and never cariacatured. If you enjoy period films, this is a great pick"
dvd,,5.0,How Some Respond To The Risks of Exploration,"The movie is remarkable at communicating these ideas and emotions:  The intent was not to send a man to the moon;  rather, it was to send mankind to the moon.  It was to go where no man had gone before.  It was to put priority and real action into a charactericstic that defines humanity:  curiosity.   And when most of mankind stopped caring about the adventurers we put at risk to pursue those goals, there were a few people who cared enough to never stop trying to find new and adaptive ways to get those adventurers out of harm's way"
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,This movie Rules,What a great film.  One of the best movies of all time.  Funny - Scary - Great to make out to.  Highly reccomended
dvd,,5.0,Excellent,"I like this series, and I think anyone who likes Superman, but is not looking for ""Comic Book Correctness"" will like this serie"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Best season yet,"Due to Richard Dean Anderson's filming schedule, he was not in the show as much as he was in the previous seasons, but the great writers fixed it so well that it was hardly noticable until the second or third time viewing. This season is great, with groundbreaking visual effects and wonderful acting. I was very happy to see several one-off episodes at the start of the season. Anubis just gets better and better. Lost City was an outstanding episode-though it took me until my second time to realize how great it was because I saw the eight season premiere before I saw this two-parter, and Dr.Weir is played by someone else in that episode, so I sat through the entire episode trying to figure out why they would do that. Oh well... "
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,"""Get Shorty"" Special Edition Review!","Barry Sonnefeld's ""Get Shorty"" was in many people's opinions the best adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel to that point. John Travolta, who had just made his big comeback performance in Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" scored another massive hit with his role of Chili Palmer, a Miami lone shark who gets sent to Hollywood to muscle a B-movie producer but ends up getting swept in by the business. Along for the ride is an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo, Dennis Farina, and James Gandolfini. ""Get Shorty"" is a fun, hip good time. The DVD special edition includes a deleted sequence involving Ben Stiller, an audio commentary, and a number of extra featurettes."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,An Absolutely Gorgeous Movie,"Watching Mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside. This may sound a bit cheesy, but the imagery in this movie is fascinating, and simply, just really fun to watch. Mirrormask it not a once-through movie, once you see it once, you want to see it again, the visuals are just too much for simply one go. And this is one of the great beauties of the movie: for all of the complex visual that it offers, the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet. Definitely a children's movie that really delivers"
dvd,,5.0,She walks in beauty like the night,"I watched The Wedding Singer in a state of enrapturement.  The movie stars Drew Barrymore.  There might have been other people in the movie, I don't really know. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,The Mothman Prophecies - a different take,"I just read Dirk's ""spolier"" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh?  Demonic, fallen angles? What?  Did we watch the same movie?  If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area  was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Robin Williams shines,I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be a very tender and wonderful film. Robin Williams and Matt Damon light up the screen. I really felt this was Williams break out role as a serious actor and he showed a lot of range (though he was also great in The World According to Garp early in his career). He totally broke away from the manic comedy routines that can exhaust you and become tiring. Ben Affleck was just poor and a piece of wood as usual but what are you going to do? I guess they were a package deal back then (he and Damon)Mini Driver was also very good. Also Stellan Skarsgard was good as Williams childhood schoolmate who made it good.
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,The last gem of Sidney Lumet,"This outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink, decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis. Please notice how Lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama."
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,I felt like a beginner!,"I had been working out on a stability for about 6 months and I thought this would be a change of pace for me and figured being a ""beginner"" workout I wouldn't have a problem. Boy was I wrong! I felt like a true beginner as I worked through the routine and was wobbling all over. Regardless, I still ""felt"" the results of the workout. "
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Vive le Monster!,"I find this DVD rather mediocre, too brief and even a little annoying. Cookie Monster has had better appearances, the DVD runs a scant thirty minutes and there is a video for one song in which Cookie Monster does not even appear. My two-year old son, however, loves it and watches it repeatedly. Since he is the intended audience, I give it four stars. He doesn't scrutinize the quality of the skits the way I do and anything more than thirty minutes would challenge his attention span. In addition to the obvious inclusion of ""C is For Cookie,"" the DVD also includes a fantasy about the moon being a giant cookie, sharing cookies with friends, bidding adieu to a beloved cookie and a skit with Annette Bening. As one would expect with content from Sesame Street, the material is educational and teaches acceptance and social skills. It is brought together by a running skit, specifically created for this video, featuring Cookie Monster as a newly employed baker... with expected results. Caution should be exercised because anyone familiar with Cookie Monster already knows that your toddler will pick up poor eating habits, meaning stuffing cookies into their mouths and leaving crumbs all over. If you can live with that, this is worry-free entertainment and a good recommendation."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Amazing, Epic, Undisputed Champion of the best Motion Picture Trilogy Ever!","Yes I know.  I said this was better than the first three Star Wars movies.  Star Wars was a great trilogy, but being a Tolkien fan these movies were done amazingly.  I had an idea of Middle-Earth in my mind after reading the books, but Peter Jackson makes you believe so vividly in the world that he has created.  I loved every minute of each movie.  That is the only movie I can say that about. The acting and CG are amazing.  The casting choices were phenomanal and Peter Jackson showed us that he is the next Spielberg after King Kong."
dvd,,4.0,Dead Alive- GORE FEST!!,"I got this movie for my little 13 yr old brother and his friends to watch and it did its job. I saw it and it was a horror. This movie has the most blood, guts, gore and comedey of any horror movies out their."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Fabulous workout!!!,"This is a MUST HAVE pilates DVD. The moves are awesome, and while you are doing it, you can feel the fantastic burns, and the stretches release the tension in your body so efficiently. The only thing that I can complain about is the breathing, I feel hard to keep up with it, the fast and forced inhales and exhales are so unnatural, I guess it takes a while to get use to. I especially like the lower body and stretch sections. As for abs, whenever I'm doing ONE HUNDRED or double leg/single leg stretch, I don't feel much around my abs, but very tense on my neck, I guess that's my weakness point. But overall, this DVD is well-structured, very well interpreted and easy to follow (only a few moves are advance for newbies like me)."
dvd,,4.0,SAW,Great movie!!!!! It will keep you interested. It will always have you there guessing the next move. A lot of twists and turns. Although it is a great movie the person who created it must of been sick or demented
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,great date movie,"I got this for my girlfriend, and she loved the movie. She is a big fan of Helen Mirriam, so this is a plus. I don't have cable, so I never saw it in the original run. (I missed it on the theaters"

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A Great Look Inside,"This DVD not only provides great entertainment, but it gives you an honest look at Jess and who she is as a person. And not to mention the 5 fantastic music videos, great interviews and other looks at the &quot;pop princess&quot;. I highly reccomend this DVD to anyone wanting a closer look at this fantastic performer and person"
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,"It was a landmark film, back in its day...","I think ""Best Years"" is now terribly dated, and it has always been overlong, but there are great performances here, especially Harold Russell's portrayal of Homer, the double-amputee, who must return from WWII with artificial hands. Set in a large, fictional, midwestern city, the film tracks the troubles of three veterans as they return to civilian life. Russell is so impressive because he was the real thing...a non-actor amputee vet. The movie is worth seeing for him alone. The Hollywood pros, of course, do good jobs in their roles as well. If your parents or grandparents were young adults in the post-war 1940's, this film will help you understand their experiences. It is fascinating, too, for the cars, the airplanes, the jobs, the courtship rules, and the relation of young adult vets to their parents or partners after years of separation. I think every adult citizen should see it at least once. We have wounded vets returning from war experiences every day in the USA in 2006, and while the nature of work and relationships have changed tremendously in the past 60 years, the fears and joys and hopes and challenges are largely the same"
dvd,8 of 10,5.0,Thanks to the Other Reviews!,"After reading the other reviews, I went ahead and purchased this DVD.  I am sort of new to step aerobics and needed something for beginners.  This was it.  I have been doing this DVD and another one for 3 weeks now 4-5 times a week.  And have had spectacular results! I have lost almost 10 lbs (a change in diet helped too)!  If you are looking for a beginner step DVD, this one is it.  In my opinion, this is a great DVD to start off with; I am ready for a more advance DVD. I am looking at Karen Voight's DVD's right now.  Good luck with the battle of the bulge! I hope this review helps!  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,BEST version by far.  ,"I agree with everyone who feels this is the very best version of this story ever put to film.  Everything about it is wonderful; but indeed, it is the acting in the scenes following the visits by the Ghosts which makes this movie stand out.  Anyone who watches those scenes, wherein Scrooge is rejoicing, without feeling it in his or her own heart is a real life Scrooge... and a humbug!"
dvd,9 of 20,5.0,:0),"Very good movie enjoyable and funny VERY FUNNY, if you are or aren't a soccer fan still watch this movie.."
dvd,2 of 6,5.0,Hilarious and addictive,"This movie is a riot!  Of all of the movies I own, this is one of the few that I will watch over and over.  It never stops being funny.  Do yourself a favor, and at least rent it.  If you don't laugh, you are in desperate need of a sense of humor and you should go find one IMMEDIATELY"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,this time they were wrong!,"It is a crying shame how voters in the oscars do not know what talent is. Leo did the performance of his lifetime. I laughed at tom hanks in Gump, I laughed at Foster in Nell. In my mind I knew they were acting but Couldnt act. Leo on the other hand made me convinced that he was a mentally disabled child. ""I dont like the word retarded"". THAT IS ACTING. Should have won that hands down and I dont blame him one BIT for not showing up for the oscars the next year. After seeing Leo lose, I give up on the oscars and are disapointed in them and do not consider them really good judges"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A Great Holiday Film,"I like this holiday movie like always, and I like it when it plays on T.V every year towards Christmas and after Thanksgiving.Another great holiday film for the famil"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,The Human Nature To Conform,"Bertolucci's 1970 film following the life of a young student of philosophy in Fascist Italy.  Not of great film quality but the film has an excellent screenplay, a clever script, and reasonable acting."
dvd,10 of 15,5.0,The cast is better than the CD,"That's right! I said it! John Rubinstein's voice is not strong enough to play Pippin. He sounds like Henry Gibson singing...anyone? Henry Gibson? &quot;Laugh-In&quot;? He was the voice of Wilbur in &quot;Charlotte's Web?&quot; No one? Okay, moving on...William Katt however not only sings &quot;Corner of the Sky&quot; he relishes it. He savors every note, and that's the way it must be sung. You wouldn't sing &quot;Do You Hear the People Sing&quot; unless you can handle it and you shouldn't sing &quot;Corner&quot; without some serious chops....or props...or snaps, or whatever the hell else it is that means &quot;talent, abilities.&quot; I also think that Ben Vereen does better live than in the studio. That's right, I think Ben Vereen gave a better performance than Ben Vereen! Not even Ben Vereen could've matched Ben Vereen as a...no, this is silly. Look, the CD's fine, but the movie's better. The arrangements, the performances, and the fact that they cut my least favorite song &quot;I Guess I'll Miss the Man.&quot"
dvd,,5.0,What a great series!,"The DVD in this series are well put together.  It is amazing to see episodes that I have never seen before.  While there are times this would be seen as a feminists biggest nightmare, it is also amazing how fresh the episdoes are.  From a historical point of view they are great viewing as well.  A bit corny, but good for a laugh or two.  I am a bit of a traditionalist as well, and am glad they are available in the original black and white format"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Style Wars ! Super Movie!,"I've seen the movie and i must says its ***** cool, it rock's..."
dvd,1 of 3,2.0,Let's Grow Old and Fat and Drunk and Stoned Together,"I was ""treated"" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,A Rare Gem,"I will forever be in the dark as to why anyone would dislike this piece of theater. So many times you hear about how ""cerebral"" and ""inaccesible"" Sondheim shows are. Is it so hard for people to think and feel at the same time?  The beauty of this piece is that it forces the audience to think about their relationship with art (either as an artist or a patron) and at the same time allows you to care for the characters deeply.  Alright, so you have to listen to it a few times before you really begin to ""get it."" This work allows you to witness an artist (considered a genius by many) who devotes himself competely to his work only to realize that he must do it at the expense of all of his other relationships.  From ""Beautiful,"" during which George tries but realizes it's too late to connect with his aging mother, to ""We Do Not Belong Together,"" when the love of his life tells him that she simply cannot be #2 anymore, I am not sure how anyone can watch these amazing moments and NOT be moved."

dvd,2 of 6,4.0,Madagascar,"This is a cute movie.  The creators of this one have one fabulous imagination.  I highly recommend watching this film.  However, this is not for small children. "
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Good intro into Ashtanga Yoga Poses,"This is exactly what it says it is, an introduction to Ashtanga Yoga poses. For someone who has been practicing Vinyasa or Ashtanga for a while, this DVD will be too basic, But if you are curious about what Ashtanga yoga is, this gives you a beginner's insight into the practice and technique in doing Sun Salutations. "
dvd,,4.0,Good Short Workouts,"The short workouts let you squeeze them in around baby's schedule, and still feel like you're getting a workout.  They are not too difficult and the countdown clock is great to see how much time is left in each segment. "
dvd,4 of 12,2.0,"Short but good nude scene, disappointing movie","Well if you want to see Angelina Jolie young and naked in a short one time scene this is the movie to buy, if you don't then leave the movie alone it's just another teen rebelion movie"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,I love it!,"My first exposure to kundalini yoga was through this Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond DVD.  I have been practicing hatha yoga (Ashtanga and vinyasa) for years; those are wonderful practices, but I never experienced the almost miraculous sense of well-being from them that I felt after doing 'Beginners and Beyond' the first time.  No lie!  So this inspired me to explore kundalini yoga more, through more of Ana & Ravi DVD's. All of their DVD's are excellent. I have not been disappointed by a single one. I highly recommend after you try this one -try  Ultimate Stretch Workout and all the new ones (Dance the Chakras, Yoga Beauty Body, and Yoga Bliss Hips"
dvd,,4.0,Awesome,For the longest time we have had this classic on VHS. At last we have upgraded. The quality is phenomenal and let's face.... Who does not love Indy?????
dvd,,5.0,Outstanding,"I found this movie to be simply fantastic! Personally I think I am a very very tough critic....Am shocked that so many find the film so-so...... De Niro was his same ole same ole outstanding. Eddie Murphy was sometimes a little wierd, but overall as the sidekick was excellent. Rene Russo had a few zzzzzzzzzoring sceens, but again like all other cast, really made the film enjoyable, START TO FINISH!!!!!!!!!!!  I give it a solid 8 outta 10, Heck I even bought the soundtrack I like it so much....Cheers Vintage Man in Californi"

dvd,2 of 7,5.0,Music,"It's just crazy to think that because of this movie, Insane Clown Posse got to where they are today. They got signed to Disney records after providing music for this movie, and later got kicked off the label for too offensive of material."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent all the way,"Lovely.  It's a sweet story with danger, humor, and regular life struggles crashing to a head in the end.  Janette Oke's books are always lovely, but seeing them come alive visually is always a treat too."

I've got to do this!"""
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,It's Captivating and Enchanting,"Like one of the other reviewers, I rented this from the library for my daughter and I to view.  No, it's not the original and it's does lack much of the creativity of the original, but my daughter and even her older brother find the mice telling a story enchanting and captivating. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Well four and a half really but... ,"This is a great dvd spanning most of Rory's career, some of the early tracks do have a little too much hum and some on screen noise bars but other than that the production is great, the energy as I remembered from Massey Hall in Toronto all those years ago.  One of my knocks of this anthology is it could have been seamless and the credits which run after every performance kept for a 'credits' section on the dvd later."
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,A real treat for newbies and diehard fans alike,"This DVD surpassed my highest expectations. When I ordered the DVD, I was not aware that these performances were all taken from European TV shows. I thought that these performances were actually recorded live at the Festival, and was expecting grainy pictures and poor audio quality. Imagine my surprise at seeing Buddy Guy introduce Big Mama Thornton as she walks out onto an indoor stage set, not unlike that of ""Saturday Night Live"". Despite the black and white picture, I felt like I was really there in the studio while she sang! The audio quality is really good."
dvd,,4.0,Dark Days - Got Balls?,"People live in the NYC subway. Are you freaking serious? That's awesome! We should all aplaud Marc Singer for making this documentary about real people who live down there. Why? Because I sure as hell wouldn't do it. Have you ever seen a NYC rat? They could eat your foot. Cinematically it doesn't even matter because the story is enough, but Singer does a great job given the circumstances. He even won the cinematography award at Sundance in 2000. I was a little shocked by that one. Just validates the expression, ""only two kinds of people can afford to live in New York, millionaires and the homeless."" I don't know who said that"
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,A pretty good movie,this was a cool sexy movie. It is nice to see kiefer sutherland in a romancey thriller type of movie. He usually is a freak. I thought the plot was pretty good it probably could have been better but oh well. I really thought it was interesting how the girl falls in love even though she is supposed to be on the job naughty naughty. I unfortunatly had to watch this movie on the lifetime network a silly t.v. thing for  woman. I saw this movie and suddenly became interested in Kiefer's movies. I haven't seen them all but i hope to someday

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Lone Star Review,"Lone Star is a complex movie that bases it's story line on a small town, Western, murder mystery.  The film exhibits excellent use of the camera, which allows the audience to get into the mind and confusion of the characters within the movie.  More importantly, though, it touches on serious subjects such as racism and interracial relationships."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A Family Movie Everyone Should See!,"This is one of, if not, the greatest story of compassion that I have ever seen.

Unfortunately, their pain goes on ignored and unheard, in a world where many don't even believe that animals have the basic right not to suffer."

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,An Epic Poem Pulled Into Two-Hours Of Cinema,"Taking from the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarsson pulls the broad poem down into a successful two-hour film filled with heroes, warriors, monsters and love (everything you need in an epic, right?)."
dvd,3 of 5,4.0,"Almost as good as ""Pride and Predjudice"".","This is a fabulous story, taken from a novel written by Catherine Gaskell. This production sticks pretty closely to the original text and in my opinion brings the characters wonderfully to life.  The story is a intense one, and the love story just as interesting as the one between Darcy and Elizabeth in ""Pride and Predjudice"".  Don't expect the same idealised views of England though,this is a far grittier and realistic period drama which captures the cold of the North of England beautifully.  My only critercism is that the final scene would never have happened in the 19th century and certainly does not happen in the book.  Although beautifully romantic, the final scene would have meant the total loss of Miss Hales reputation.  People simply would not and could not behave in that way in Victorian England.  That's not to say that it's not a lovely ending though"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Cool... very cool!,"Not exactly a concert video, but not really a documentary either.  The few concert videos I've seen (including U2's ""Elevation"") are of a single edited concert, and largely limited to a handful of cameras and angles.  In contrast, ""Rattle & Hum"" shows a series of different concerts around the US during their Joshua Tree tour with incredible camera angles that put you right on the stage.  But it goes a bit beyond that and shows some rehersals and recording sessions for some of the new songs, some backstage shots, and a few brief interviews, but not to the point where you would really call it a ""documentary.""  The Edge really puts it best when he says (about the film), ""it's about music."""
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,So what good is it?,"Frank Capra tries out eccentricity for size in the enchanting ""You Can't Take it With You,"" a movie all about doing whatever makes you happy, not rich. While he's not quite in his element here (this is supposed to be really weird?), the talented cast and heartwarming message make this a truly enchanting, sweet movie."
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,A World Reknown Classic,"A great achievement in movie history. The famous Charles Chaplin wrote the script, acted and even wrote the music for his movies. The jokes are timeless and seem to never get old. In the year 2104 it is likely this King of Komedy will be a cultural icon that even the children know of while names like Adam Sandler would drift into oblivion. For those unfamiliar with b&amp;w silent movies it may seem hard to follow but once mastered these movies will have you in an uproar. Charles Chaplin, the world renkown actor is further immortalized in this great collection"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Fine Adaptation,"One of the finest film adaptations of a play, Tennessee Williams pulls all the stops so that Richard Burton can go gaga as the sex obsessed defrocked minister in a tropical setting surrounded by women that think he's ""so hot.""  No doubt, Burton in 1964 is at the top of his game, oozing sensuality while walking on glass to deny it.  "
dvd,6 of 14,2.0,Careful as you might feel cheated,There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD
dvd,,5.0,love this movie!,reminds me of somewhat of my life. 
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Simply a great movie,"I've probably seen this movie 20 times since it came out and I still watch it when it comes on television. I must say that some of the acting seems a bit corny now, but the images, characters and the story are still as gripping as ever. MIIS is basically a remake of the gangster classic Public Enemy from 1931. At that time Warner Brothers studios had directors that were interested in telling real stories. Another example also from 1931, I think, was I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. Basically these films were about how life was in the early thirties for some people, like gangsters or poor people."
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Pretty Cheesy Horror Collection,"John Carpenter's Body Bags in a series of 3 stories all told by ""The Coroner"" played by of course John Carpenter (Escape From L.A and New York). First segment is called ""The Gas Station"" which is the shortest,  where a young woman, played by Alex Dratcher (Passenger 57, Scorcher) who starts a new job at the gas station. She is actually going to school for pyschology. She soon becomes a little paranoid on the job and eventually when the night is over it becomes a little bloody. Robert Carradine (Revenge of the Nerds), David Naughton (An American Werewolf In Paris), Wes Craven (Scream Trilogy), Peter Jason (They Live, Red Heat) and Sam Raimi (Evil Dead movies) also star in that segment. The second segment is called ""Hair"" which is the stupidest one out of the whole bunch which stars Stacy Keach (Escape from LA, Up In Smoke) who plays Richard, a man who doesnt want to be bald. So he goes to doctor David Warner (Titanic, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2) who gives him the stuff to grow his hair back but after Richard gets his hippie hair, things dont seem right. Deborah Harry (BLONDIE) and Sheena Easton (Real Ghosts, Tek War) also star in that segment. The third and final segment called ""Eye"" which is the best one out of all three and the longest too about baseball player Mark Hammill (Star Wars, The Guyver) who gets in a horrible car accent and eventually loses his eye. Doctors implant him with a brand new eye but what Hamill soon finds out is that the eye itself was the former owner of a sick and murdering individual. Twiggy Lawson (Twiggy, Woundings), Roger Corman (its Roger frickin' Corman people know what hes done) and Charlie Napier (Austin Powers) also star in that segment. ""The Mourge"" segment also has Tom Arnold (Roseanne) and Tobe Hooper (Funhouse, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) in it as well. Some of the acting and script is very cheesy. Carpenter as the corpse like ""Coroner"" doesnt do anything original with it because it's bascially we've seen that in Tales From The Crypt and what not. So-so fun is had here"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,In Magnificent Black and White!,"A true swashbuckler, with all the necessary elements - slavery, abeautiful woman who gets seduced by goodness, the best swordsman in all England and the Seven Seas!  All in glorious B&W!"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,One of the funniest films ever.,"Two friends, Stan and Billy, take a road trip down south but run into trouble when they are mistakenly arrested for murder in Alabama. The hapless youngsters have no money to hire an attorney but Billy's cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) is a lawyer so they call on him to help. What they don't realise is that Vinny took 6 attempts to pass his legal exams and, what's more, has no courtroom experience to speak of. What follows is none stop humour and 'laugh aloud' moments as the brash New Yorker sweeps into the hick town accompanied by his strident girlfriend, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei)."
dvd,14 of 47,2.0,Manipulative," Though well made, the movie is manipulative, really leaving more questions than answers. The narrator is extremely vague, -- ""certain people"" ""they"" among other euphemisms -- refuses to include other points of view, making it ipso facto propaganda, and plays more on the viewer's emotions than anything else... Part of it is a pro-illegal immigration manifesto. The actual phrasing of the Geneva Convention is manipulated too -- in the actual document, it says that only those who fight under a uniform are entitled to it's protections. The documentary claims that all people are, regarldess... Overall, it's basically a documentary with some a few valid points but overall just well-made propaganda"
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,Magnificent,"I've watched many Japanese movies and have never 'felt' them until I watched ""Ran"". Powerful, 'Dark', you can almost guess what's going to happen but it still comes at you and makes it all the harder to bear. The Criterion Collection has done a wonderful, if not masterful remake of this classic. Wow"

dvd,2 of 4,5.0,WHAT?!!? No awards or nominations for this beautiful film?!?,"This movie was moving, brilliantly filmed, consistent and thought provoking throughout. Each portrait is beautifully portrayed, each woman struggling with her own story, ghosts and baggage, fears and hopes, searching for a sense of her own power, all the while looking for something better... What will it take to seize the moment fearlessly?"

I wasn't the only one I loaned them to two of my friends and my sister and aunt and they all agree... I was actually hopeing to preorder season 3 when I came across this aweful review about how the show is no good. This show is great you get real addicted to it. Yes, Horacio Caine is star struck but come on its a TV show get over it the characters all have their own personality. I honestly think this show is awesome!! Vegas is awesome too just in it's own way... Either one is worth the money... hope you enjoy it as much as I do!! I  also hope this review is at least a little bit helpful!!"
dvd,,5.0,Classic,"I first saw this movie in 1998, years after the original release. It was my senior year in High School and we watched this movie in art class. After the movie was over I was probably the only student begging the art teacher to let me borrow the movie, and luckily she did. Now I'm lucky again that I can find this movie after years of searching video stores"

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Rebellion = self-discovery, expressing individuality","Maria is a teenager whose father is a priest in a parish in a small town in Norway in the late 1950s. She is awakening to her individuality but finds the rules of her religion and home stifling ... Her friends are discovering the opposite sex while she is not even allowed to wear lipstick or mascara. Maria is wrestling with the teachings of her church and the natural inclinations of her own mind and nature ... Her father is the priest who has strict rules and a strict interpretation of the Bible - yet Maria has discovered the Song of Solomon where the verses speak exactly about the feelings she is experienceing. When sitting in church, her mind wanders to what she is missing and when listening to the sermon, her mind compares what she is truly feeling which differs from the narrow view presented of what G-d wants from his subjects. She ponders why G-d created imperfect human beings and then forces them to follow strict rules ... Maria's mother is a thin, gaunt lady whose life was squeezed out of her. She seems to have little say in the marriage, her role is that of an obedient servant."
dvd,2 of 9,5.0,very entertaining,i loved this movie and think it is the best out of the trilogy. it  is so erptic that even gay guys would enjoy the scenes
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,This Is Batman!,"Batman, like the Phoenix, has risen from the ashes and has returned with 'Batman Begins'. This movie is truly amazing and is never dull. I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time."
dvd,24 of 24,5.0,Goodbye (for now) Dr. Lewis,"Since it's beginning in September of 1994, ER has been my favorite television shows. The great story lines and great characters that have appeared on this show have occupied my Thursday nights for 11 years."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Tarantino at His Best,"This is Tarantino at his best.  A strong dialogue driven character piece that involves amazing actors in outlandish situations.  The dialogue is crisp, the direction astounds and the story involving.  There are scenes that make you squirm and there are scenes that make you laugh.  Overall, an enjoyable experience..."
dvd,3 of 18,1.0,Girl movie ,Girls in this movie are portrayed as underdogs struggling against stupid boy bullies. It's a pretty way to boy-bash and promote sexist stereotypes that girls are good and boys are bad.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,TOBE HOOPER'S TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE STILL OUTSHINES THEM ALL!!!!!," ""Who will survive and what will be left of them"" going into this movie you're already thinking, and this is one of the rare movies that lets the viewer think what it wants, which makes the movie all that more potent. There is not excess gore, violence or a huge body count and what you do see and hear allows you  to use your mind and that is where your imagination takes over and you become part of the movie. Ask anyone who has seen this movie and 9 out of 10 times what they say happened is what their imagination saw . That is why Tobe Hooper is a genius, because he lets the viewer add what they will, even upon repeat viewing's Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't lose that power. Even the cast was perfect, although sadly underrated, unknown and grossly underpayed (if they were even payed at all), had anybody else been used it would not have been as good. Nobody but Edwin Neal could have portrayed ""The Hitchhiker"" as well as he did. And the way Marilyn Burns became"" Sally"" it's like you were right there with her. Jim Siedow added so much with just his facial expressions let alone his acting  and nobody and I do mean nobody  could  of done Leatherface as good as Gunnar Hansen did. His chainsaw dance at the end is phenomenal. The budget being so low also added to the final outcome of how good the movie is. Every aspect of this movie worked. That is why The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is in a class of its own. Both of Rob Zombie's (excellent) movies have the feel of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you can tell he was definitely influenced. To all of the younger movie fans out there, before you watch a movie at least take into consideration the year the movie was first released. If your diet of horror movies is only from the 80's or 90's (where it was basically body count , skin , & a ton of special effects) & more recently the  ""safe PG-17"" (so we milk as much money as possible out of the youth) your only watching with your eyes and not your imagination.  Not that I don't like those kinds of movies, I too am also a HUGE Horror movie aficionado/junkie; especially any and all ZOMBIE movies, I've seen hundreds of underground, B-grade, cheesy, low budget movies, including every TROMA movie ever produced. At least be open minded when viewing a movie. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the first in the genre and still the best. Before Michael, Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, Chucky etc. etc.   and countless other 80's & 90's bad guys (or girls) Leatherface still outshines them all. The quality of the movie itself on this Ultimate edition is reason enough to pick it up.  The bonus features are killer you get a very interesting commentary with Tobe Hooper, Gunnar Hansen & Daniel Pearl with some killer info about filming, effects used, and recollections from all three. Also included is another commentary with Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Allen Danziger, and art designer Robert A. Burns. ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Shocking Truth"" & ""Flesh Wounds"" two very well done documentaries. Also a tour of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre house with Gunnar, deleted scenes, outtakes, bloopers, trailers, TV and radio spots & much more, plus it comes in a tin case.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Ultimate Edition DVD should be in every horror movie collection. This is the sixth edition of Texas Chainsaw Massacre that I have purchased & definitely worth owning. Another edition worth having is the ""Chainsaw Flip Case"" which has 2 DVD's inside of a Chainsaw - very nice packaging."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The Philosophy of War,"Not for the faint of heart, Turtles is a semi-realistic portrayal of life in Iraq after the first Gulf War.  It could be described as a mix between The Thin Red Line and Lord of the flies, offering both a subtle philosophic insight into the outcomes of war and a narrative built around children being forced into the role of adults.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Toyboy redeems playgirl,"This charming and delightful film is the glittering obverse of that horrible downer, Midnight Cowboy. New York is dreamy, the clothes are gorgeous, Hepburn is unbearably lovely and appealing, Peppard is steady and straight. The characters develop through the film, they grow in maturity and substance. Peppard ditches his humiliating life as a parasite, and gets a job. Hepburn, who is what used to be called a B-girl (I think), not a prostitute or a call-girl or an escort, finally sheds the sleaze and finds true love. In the 30s she might have been a Manhattan baby. Moon River is about as different from that dreadful whiney thing in Cowboy as it possibly could be, written by the unmatchable Johnny Mercer. The only rats are the punters and snobs, and the hornily heartless middle-aged lady. There's a bit of Sweet Charity and Pretty Woman, as well as Cabaret, in the story; but this bubbling froth, with bite and feeling, rises to top the lot. Take your pick, folks, I know which one I'm going for. Audrey forever. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Comedy and Drama at its very best!!!,"I absolutely loved ""Good Times"" the complete first season.  I remember being a little girl, watching Good Times while my mother was preparing dinner.  When I bought the DVD, it reminded me so much of my wonderful childhood and the great ethical comedy that the whole family could watch and enjoy.  Today, I am married with three children and my oldest daughter who is 11, loves to watch and laugh with her mother.  Its like looking at it for the very first time, each and every time I watch it, which is at least once a week!!"
dvd,1 of 7,4.0,All-Stars= Great Selection,The people of All Stars are
dvd,4 of 10,4.0,"Volume Four Starts Strong, But Ends Weakly","This is the fourth set of DVDs that complete the WrestleMania Anthology.  Sadly, the last two WrestleManias (19 and 20) aren't that great.  However, this set includes some awesome matches from ""WrestleMania 2000"" (Edge/Christian vs. The Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz in a Ladder match, or Mick Foley vs. Big Show vs. The Rock vs. Triple H in a No DQ Elimination match for the WWF Championship)."
dvd,1 of 4,4.0,The best season,"The second season of the original Star Trek is the best. My favorite from this season is ""mirror,mirror"" There are a few that aren't very good, however, like ""assignment:earth"" which was intended as a pilot for a series that didn't get produced. However, there are more great episodes than bad in this season"
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Not bad at all for an indie thriller,"As I never expect a lot from indie thrillers, this one was far better than I thought. Although the twists and turns were not quite unpredictable, they still got you some way or another. Also, enjoy a good performance (and some real nice body shots) given by Nastassja Kinsky if you're a fan of hers. To me Nastassja looked much better with age and she really mastered the sex scenes when needed. Josh Holloway (playing the psycho depressed hunk) was fine too. I would give this movie 5 stars if they cast someone more convincing (like William H. Macy) in the place of Jeff Fahey. But, as I said, I never expect a lot..."
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Vintage Michael Moore,"No one goes after the ""bad guys"" like Michael Moore. He is relentless asking big business why not take care of the working man who put you where you are today?  He asks the simple question, why not share the wealth?  He pursues the answers to these questions in a humorous and compassionate manner. Being a working woman myself, and working in the auto industry, I appreciate where this documentary comes from"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A fascinating dramatic series...,"Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood..."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Not Her Best Season- But I Still Love Lucy!,"I love Lucy- and have most of her movies and most of the series. This season however is not my favorite... although featuring some classic episodes such as when Lucy and Ethel wear burlap sacks by accident thinking their designer dresses or that infamous wine stomping scene. But, mainly Lucy and Ricky have lost that ""spark"" you saw in seasons 1-4 having notrious difficulties at the time you call that on screen as well."
dvd,,5.0,Prancer DVD,Best movie for the Christmas Holiday.  Sam Elliott is wonderful.......it is my altime favorite!  Every family should have a copy of prancer
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,My favorite Van Damme movie,"Anyone who gave this movie a 1 star rating needs to go find a really high cliff to go jump off of. This is actually a pretty decent film, with some beautiful shots and cool desert scenery, and ok acting from Van Damme. Most of the supporting cast play their parts quite well too I believe (and seemingly good chemistry between the main characters). I mean yeah of course this isn't Lawrence of Arabia or Saving private ryan, but then again what else is? I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie, it has some kind of pleasant addicting nature to it that I can't quite describe. A great film to watch if you are sick at home or just plain out of your mind bored. And also, I'll definitely have to give this movie props as being the best movie I've ever found in the Walmart 5 dollar bin. Even better than the lower budget clint eastwood flicks that I've found in there. It's THAT good!"
dvd,0 of 3,4.0,has some real highlights,"What is up with the Lois Lane character?  When she showed up attending high school and looked like should be teaching, I thought, ""ok, I can learn to ignore this"", but now I find myself completely mezmerized by her botoxed face!  The woman's eyebrows and cheeks are completely immoveable!  And don't get me started on the breast implants! She is very badly cast.  "
dvd,,4.0,Cohen's The Man!,"There aren't too many directors that could pull-off a horror film about a mutant, killer newborn on the loose, but there aren't too many directors like Larry Cohen either. No matter how outlandish the premise of a Cohen film might be, he has a real knack for getting you to least play along, because outside of the fantastic elements, dramatically Cohen's films ring true."
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,Excellent overview fo the commanders,"This excellent series, ""Civil War Journal"" gives another great set for its fans and is a must-see for serious students of the war. While the general's names are well known, their motivations get a thorough examination. So many of the key players had friends and even kin on ""the other side."" West Point Classmates gives an excellent in-depth look at the early training and molding of values that influenced the sometimes heartbreaking choices these American heroes were forced to make. Highly recommend"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Five stars is to few,This is quite simply the most motivational film ever amde. Nothing short of comeplete brilliance. WHY? Five words:
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Like eating chocolate...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of ""ER,"" and the second season did not disappoint me either.  If I had a problem with the series, it was in the different problems that the producers cook up for the main characters.  Of course it's fascinating watching the choices that each character makes, but the problems are becoming more and more debaucherous.  It would be nice to see positive character development instead of the constant angst that seems to be mounting underneath the surface.  Watching ""ER"" is like eating chocolate:  It's good in medium-sized doses, but too much at a time can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  But I would say the purchase is worth the cost"
dvd,,4.0,A Wholesome Movie to Own,"Yes, this movie did not follow the books. Many people were angry that the movies weren't accurate. I can understand, but I have to write that it is an excellent movie to own anyway. It is very wholesome and it is hard to find quality wholesome movies in this day and age."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Entertaining And Fun: Especially  For The Kids!,"When I first viewed ""Jurassic Park"" in a theatre on Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles, I actually walked out. It wasn't so much because of the film, but the speaker system in the theatre were so darn loud, I thought I was back on an Air Force flightline. I actually had to cover my ears it was so irritating. And I was not alone, many others got up to leave too. This film has been discussed to the point that I don't believe there is anything further I can add. However, I am not a big dinosaur film type person. [I really like archaelogy, and Paleantology, however, as one who is not a specialist, but through an interest in the past]."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Funny!,The Amos and N Andy show was a terrifically funny show and
dvd,8 of 8,4.0,Good for back trouble,"This Pilates workout is intended for those who need an extra-gentle Pilates session to strengthen abs and rehab the back. I found it to be an excellent, gentle and safe introduction to Pilates. (Always check with a practitioner first though). I also recommend Allan Menezes Pilates for back pain"
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,superb historical drama on redemption and coming of age,"I watched this with total absorption at the plight of this unusual man, the Hurricane.  His story, as others outlined in reviews here, is very sad and unjust:  accused of a crime he didn't commit by a racist cop with an odd hatred of him, he is thrown in prison at the height of his career.  "
dvd,4 of 6,4.0,The best of the series,"Despite the disc I received(with 2 scratches on the back)I think this is the best of the series that lauched Tom Cruise career(which had other sucesses).I'm a bit dissapointed about this Special Edition.No making off are in the disc only some featurettes focusing Tom Cruise and the story of Mission Impossible in the last 40 years since it's first TV series.Just a few trailers and tears focusing mostly on MIF 3.I really wanted to see the rolling of the film and how the stunts and FX were created(ILM,Blue screen shots and at)."
dvd,,5.0,Perfect Love Story,"Love story meets dark comedy.  Cameron Diaz said it best in ""There's Something About Mary"" - Harold and Maude is the greatest love story of all time.  The story is great, the humor priceless, and the soundtrack is fabulous"
dvd,,4.0,"Fast-paced, amusing look at an internet company's implosion","E-dreams will probably be most interesting for those who are more business-minded or who were part of the internet boom. If you're neither of these, you may find yourself wondering, 'why do I care about this company,' or 'boy, that Joseph Park guy is really full of himself.' But if you are business-minded in the least, or if you have a passing sociological interest in that crazy period of economic history, you will probably find yourself captivated by the heady sense of inevitable world domination that permeated the offices of Kozmo.com and similar companies, which this documentary does a decent job of capturing. "
dvd,,4.0,Campy hunky boyz in speedos!,"This is definitely a B-movie, so don't expect great acting or special effects, but boy, does it have hunky guys showing off their glistening bodies as much as possible.  Imagine a movie starring a bunch of Abercrombie & Fitch models... and imagine acting along the caliber of said models.  The only thing that really bothered me was the ridiculous and annoying ""special effect"" used whenever the leeches attacked someone. But, now that it is available at a really low price, it's even more worth it if you like campy, brainless fun.  This is one of those flix that you would rate ""1 star"" if your reference point is a normal Hollywood blockbuster, but for the genre that it is, this is definitely a great addition"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Wonderful Life,"What a wonderful story. This simple movie poignantly wraps the meaning of life into one moment of our memory and underlines the saying, ""an unexamined life is one not worth living."" "
dvd,1 of 3,1.0,Suspiria....The Woods Is DEFINITELY Not,"Two things caused me to give this film a rental: the comparisons to ""Suspiria"" and Bruce Campbell. Combining these two elements, this movie should have been a no-brainer. Most modern horror movies lack the sense of tension of the movies of the 80's and before. For example, ""Halloween"" is pretty tame in the gore department but the atmosphere, camera work and music combine to give the viewer the feeling of ""What's going to happen next?"" throughout. I can't think of one modern horror movie; aside from ""High Tension"", that creates that same sense of dread."
dvd,28 of 29,5.0,Wonderful screen adaptation of the Chekov play,Two points to make: 
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Comfort Movie,"I LOVE this movie and I was so worried it would never get to DVD since not many people have even heard of it. Its one of those movies that you can watch in your PJ's over and over. I just think of it as a comfort movie, I'm sure plenty of people would think thats crazy but I really like it =o"

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,A Worthy Sequel,"The first Spider-Man movie was great, and this one follows in its footsteps.  I would go as far as to say it is even better than the first.  It is always impressive to see Spider-Man display his powers, and with modern special effects, we get to see him in all of his glory, as his creator Stan Lee had intended.  There is one particular part in this movie that brings a tear to my eye.  It is that powerful.  It is this one part where Spidey uses his powers to the max in order to save a trainload of people.  It is simply AWESOME.  The rest of the movie is good too, but that is my favorite part.  If you like comic books, action films, or both, I recommend this title to you"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,A real score for Beckett aficionados,"Not to gush, but many of the versions in this set far surpass my expectations of film adaptations of theatre. For instance, ""Endgame"" is brilliantly realized, with finely nuanced acting. Top talent on both sides of the camera, often visually arresting works. Really great stuff for any Beckett or experimental theatre enthusiast. Pricey, but worth it"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Say A Prayer....,"From the opening scene in Dean and Britta's apartment to the last note of 23 Minutes In Brussels during the end credits, this film delivers a poignant view of how beautiful things must sometimes come to an end.  For Luna fans, you will find the interstitial music just as fascinating as the content of the film...previously unreleased music taken from studio outtake wanderings by each band member.  The bonus materials feature a massive onslaught performance of Black Postcards (nearly 10 minutes long).  I think I would have bought this DVD for that alone!  It truly is sad that Luna is no longer performing, I'm glad I was able to see them a few times during their existence...having this film on my shelf to comfort me really isn't proper solace, but it helps"
dvd,,5.0,Peter Sellers final bow?,"I had always been under the impression that this was Peter Sellers final movie, recently I had heard that his ""Fu Manchu"" movie was technically his last film because it was released after ""Being There"" - I guess in the big scheme of things it really doesn't matter unless you need a correct answer for a $100,000.00 Jeopardy question.  If this wasn't his last movie, it should have been - before you curse me, allow me to explain what I mean - this certainly was one of his best performances, and it was a role that he seemed destined to play, it was almost like it was written for him.  He had a long, successful career with quite a mixture of movies - as with any actor, he had more than his share of less than memorable movies, BUT amongst them, he also left us with some really brilliant and classic performances - the ""collection"" of characters he did in ""Dr Strangelove"", Inspector Clouseau (although near the end of that run his character had degraded into a cartoonish version of itself - the last ""Panther"" movie, released after his death, didn't even use Seller's actual voice, relying instead on a ""voice actor"" that cheapened it even more)- just to name a few.  With ""Being There"" being such a superb performance, it would have been most fitting, and almost a poetic way to remember the man.  You've seen all the other reviews, with all the other descriptions, but this movie is a little tricky to describe - what comes to my mind is that it is a movie full of illusions, it takes on everything - life and death, world politics, power, relationships, and everything in between.  The movie is also about perspective - how we view everything around us, and how we are viewed by others.  The movie makes a very effective point about how things are rarely what they seem to be - we tend to see and believe what we think we should be seeing and believing, as if we are all creating our own realities.  The movie is also what you make it, it works on many levels - it can be as simple, or as complex as your imagination can make it.  It is definetly one of those films that can be viewed more than once - and each time you might notice something different, or learn more.  What can I say?  It's a great film full of great performances - the author, Jerzy Kozinski, is a world class writer, and if you are not familiar with his work, I would also urge you to read one of his creations - but be forewarned, some of his stuff is pretty dark and disturbing (The Painted Bird, for instance)BUT, it is also a great book - it just tells the story of a young boy trying to survive in Europe during WWII (based on Kozinsky's actual life, I believe).  But - ""Being There"" - if you don't buy it, you should at least view it once - if you are a serious collector, you'll just want to add it anyway.  Thanks for your time"
dvd,1 of 6,5.0,fantastic movie,"Now that I'm older I understand the complexities of this movie much better. There are many plots & sub plots here with excellent performances by the cast. It makes strong statements about heros, legends, mean bullies and ""the Taming of the West."""
dvd,1 of 11,2.0,Should be Santa vs. the producers,"I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the ""New Rudolph"".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great Series Worth Watching,"I originally saw this series on the Cartoon Network Adult Swim segment back in 2005.

dvd,17 of 19,2.0,Not as good as others...,"This documentary was rather disappointing to me. Mr. Hammond is a fine musician but too much of the film is wasted showing him performing Johnson's music. It was interesting watching Hammond and Mr. Johnny Shines 'cuttin' heads' on the street corners of a delta town. However, Hammond isn't a good interviewer and it seems like he just uses this as a platform to showcase his own considerable talent. I would advise anyone to stay away from this one and get 'Can't you hear the wind howl' instead. This is basically a rehash of all the same material. If your a diehard like me, go ahead and watch it but you might be disappointed"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,The show that shouldn't work still going strong,"Comedy Central's Reno 911 is one of those rare shows that shouldn't work, and yet it surprisingly does.  As the third season of the show opens, the inept officers of the Reno, Nevada sheriff's department are freed from prison and leading new lives, only to be re-united again and eventually re-instated as cops, much to their dismay.  The improvised jokes and gags come as fast and furious as a long time fan of the show would come to expect, yet pretty much everything here still manages to feel fresh.  Thomas Lennon (Dangle) and Robert Garant (Junior) are still the funniest attractions of Reno 911, and even when a new recruit (Mary Birdsong) joins the force, the show still keeps rolling along.  There's plenty of other hilarity that ensues throughout the season, including Weigel (Kerry Kinney-Silver) planning to wed her serial killer boyfriend; not letting a little thing like him sitting on death row spoil her plans of matrimony.  All in all, the third season of Reno 911 only improves everything that the surprising Comedy Central hit has laid out, and while these cops are definitely not the best, you can't deny that they're not the funniest"

The cameos are wonderful...Richard Dreyfuss as the doc who pumps Streep's stomach?! Gene Hackman as Streep's suffering director...the list goes on. The ""bad"" thing is that we're left with one big unanswered question - when is Meryl Streep going to record a real album? Her voice is incredible! Fun, funny, and all too true - this one's a winner"
dvd,0 of 6,5.0,Terrific but Letterbox Please,"There's not much to add about this movie beyond what has been written already, other than it's too bad they didn't produce it in letterbox.

I suspect younger viewers might be a put off by what might seem a little too much attention to the cattle, but the story builds steadily to the climactic scenes"

dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Easter Parade is the Easter Serenade!!,"This motion picture, full of laughter, hapiness and wonderful music stars Judy Garland & Fred Astaire in their only film together.  Judy plays Hannah Brown, a struggling ""cabaret-ish"" performer who is discovered by Don Hewes (Fred Astaire).  As the minutes of this movie run you find romancetaking its roll and the wonderful music that accompanies this matsterpiece of Metro Goldwyn Mayer.  This movie is one of the greatest musicals with no one better than Miss Judy Garland and Fred Astaire.  Film Fact:  Gene Kelly was to play opposite of Judy, but due to a broken leg suggested that they give the role of don Hewes to his good collegue Fred Astaire.  Fred Astaire was in retirement at the time, but came out to work with Judy.  All in all this film glorifies every aspect of the musical motion picture.  I give you Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford in Glorious Technicolor, Easter Parade 1948.  Enjoy!!"
dvd,,4.0,Return of the Oompa-Loompas,"We went as a family to the theater to see ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". The involvement of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, along with the need to see another treatment of Roald Dahl's classic children's book got me interested. We have the '70s musical version with Gene Wilder on VHS. It was OK but didn't quite capture Dahl's magic. "
dvd,10 of 10,4.0,"Seagal proved he still had it, then flunked out again","A lot of you may have considered Steven Seagal's non-presence for the 4 years before this film a blessing (he last appeared in 1997's Fire Down Below, which was a No. 1 hit but still weak movie) but I think that audiences are just too dismissive of him and that he needs to be given another chance. They waited for him to slip up and as soon as he delivered a flop he got called names and we forgot about him. Give the guy a break. The Mob is after him! And in real life his Aikido won't do him any good in that kind of situation."
dvd,10 of 13,4.0,Better then PLATOON???,"Many people will disagree, but I 100% enjoyed this movie, even more so than the highly over-rated Platoon. So why is it so good? Well, in short, because it's realistic, the acting is brilliant and the action is impressive...making this film great for repeated viewing. Ok, so some of the effects are a little dated e.g. when a soliders head is blown to shreads the bits of skull are obviously made of cheap rubber or plastic. "
dvd,,4.0,Dog Whisperer,"I don't happen to get Cesar Millan's show on my cable network and have never seen him on any other show, but everyone I know has been singing his praises. I bought the DVD because it was reasonably priced and I was having some aggressive issues with my dog, Dempsey. This DVD gave me enough information for me to correct the aggressive issues with Dempsey. It also gave me the knowledge that Dempsey needs to see me as the pack leader for me to get him to do what I want"
dvd,8 of 13,5.0,Excellent,"I don't own this DVD, but I am a devoted fan of the show on Cartoon Network. The story is highly original. And the art? I am studying artist and I must say that this is perhaps one of the most beautiful animes I have ever seen. It made by the same people who made Cowboy Bebop, another excellent anime. The well defined shadows, the dazzaling character designs (man, that Blue is a one sweet hottie, for a dog anway), the jaw dropping backgrounds. And then it's all held together by one of the most fantastic soundtracks ever made, composed by the legendary Yoko Kanno (the composer of the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack). I don't think I can think of the words to properly describe it. If your a fan of anime, then you must pick this up. It's almost like a requirement"
dvd,,4.0,New meaning to car show.,"When you're in love, you're in love right? No one says it can't be with a car. I love some aspects of the film better because it leaves pieces missing and unexplained which is what captivates people, creates debates, and enhances fear. Arnie is a nerdy teen boy...until he fixes up Christine. The moment he saw the old junk car, he was enticed. After polishing her to protection, we soon learn that all Christine needed was a little bit of love...and the rest she can do herself. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,The First World War - A Commendable Effort,"I found this series to be engaging and thoughtfully done. It used a great deal of archival footge I had never seen before.

The makers brought forth the tragedy of this conflict while maintaining an even and intelligent presentation of it"

So, I had been avoiding watching this film, until this most recent trip. I was pleasantly surprised...it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. The film centers on two characters, played by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. MS does a fantasic job of playing the editor of a fashion magazine similar to Vogue, who is very much the dragon lady you might expect. AH does a great job of playing a young graduating journalist who falls into the fashion world as MS's assistant, and suffers accordingly, but then goes through a transformation that she doesn't really understand is going on at first, and then later is very unhappy with. I was expecting vacuous, but this film wasn't that"

On DVD, it's back, along with the chain gang demolition of a drug dealer's car (""Goin' to Mississippi, Goin' to see Delilah""...) Leslie Nielsen's reminiscences are excellent...he gives the reason for the show's failure after six episodes as ""people don't actually WATCH TV...they don't pay attention, so they miss the gags."" He's right...this DVD is the equivalent of six highly compressed movies, with no filler and no fat. It's been a long time coming and it was worth the wait."
dvd,11 of 12,2.0,"Introduction to Yoga: Gentle, for Extreme Beginners","Very disappointing.  If this is for beginners, I wonder what a DVD for ""experts"" would be like.  The rhythm of the movements was too fast, and the sound was not at all soothing, which to me is the essence of Yoga.  Perhaps I didn't know what to expect since I have never taken any yoga classes.  But that was my purpose in ordering this ""beginning"" Yoga DVD--too learn the basics and the ""feel"" of Yoga. "
dvd,19 of 20,5.0,The Garden needs help.,"A great sequel to the many originals. It was great to see returning characters. Though the Garden may have shrunken a little if you're a fan of the Kate Maberly version, but the Magic is still there. When Miss Mary must leave Misstlethwait manor, the garden door disappears. Martha Sowerby, the house keeper, tries looks for it, but even with all the ivy covering it, she knows it's not there. No one knows why, but the Vibrance of the once gorgeous garden, is gone, and the plants are dying. But when a little orphan girl named Lizzie Buscana from America comes to live in the large orhanage, she realizes the garden needs her help. Dickon may not be here to help, but all by herself, Lizzie can bring back the magic just by using her own instincts. Martha, now much older, and wiser, starts to realize, that Lizzie may be the only one who can save the garden now. With a little help with some animal friends, a lot of tender loving care, and friendship, the kids of Misstlethwait can bring the garden back to life by just being themselves. It was a great adition to the secret garden collection. Some people say that the secret garden all by itself was fine, and that this movie wasn't needed, but watching this movie shows adults that kids need to play. In this case the garden wanted to be played in. Just sitting there in the middle of a field makes you feel alone. With the garden returning, and 5 star acting, you can make this another addition to your secret garden collection"
dvd,,5.0,Interesting tale of the Ultimate Warrior,"If you liked the Ultimate Warrior at all during the late 80's, you will like this DVD.  It may be a one sided account of the Ultimate Warrior's tenure, but it still is one of the better made WWE documentaries.  Super fans of the Ultimate Warrior will be disappointed with the views, but fans of wrestling will find it informative and entertaining. "

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,March of the Penguins!,"I saw this movie in theaters, and soon after it came out on DVD, my brother and I bought it. This is a great documentary, and even though it was on the big-screen it didn't take on a Hollywood feel because the real story is better than anything they could have made up. The cinematography in this movie is fantastic! The penguins look so clear and the Antarctic scenery is beautiful. Everything about this film is amazing and it is also a very touching movie. For reasons like; the loss of a chick, or the bond between the family and seeing the parents leaving it's chick forever. Also, Morgan Freeman did a great job as narrator."

Let me say I only enjoyed the movie slightly because it beat being fried in the boiling heat outside. First of all, the plot has so many holes in it I seriously think that someone held the script up to the wall and shot twenty rounds at it. Secondly, I believe I watched an episode of Teletubbies once and laughed more then than I did during this movie. Finally, the movie is more bland than a block of tofu. No action, no drama, not the slightest trace of good humor."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Shaun of the Dead (4.5 stars),"As ridiculous as it sounds, the description on the cover of the DVD (""A romantic comedy. With zombies."") is completely true. Shaun of the Dead, of course being a pun on one of Romero's zombie flicks Dawn of the Dead, starts out with a glimpse into a very bad day in Shaun's (Simon Pegg) life: Shaun's flatmate Pete badgers him about his other flatmate and best friend for life Ed (Nick Frost) who is an unemployed slob, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him for being unreliable, and his teenage subordinates at his dead-end job make him feel increasingly old and obsolete. At least it's not the end of the world, right? The next day, Shaun humorously goes about his routine in the exact same way, not taking care to notice the zombie infestation that occured literally overnight until Ed points out a strange girl in the garden. With the truth suddenly dawning on them, Shaun and Ed head out to rescue Liz and her flatmates along with Shaun's mother and stepfather. What seemed like a perfect plan falls victim to increasingly more complicated hitches as the movie goes on until it's no longer a spoof on the zombie genre but a very real, emotionally charged drama set inside the events of a zombie outbreak. Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright continue their series of excellent ideas from their hilarious sitcom Spaced with some of the best screenwriting and directing in years. Shaun of the Dead is every pop culture fanboy's dream: the script is filled to the brim with zombie references from sources as obvious as Night of the Living Dead to the obscure videogame Zombies Ate My Neighbors, not to mention a million other homages to just about every other form of mass media (for example, the debate around The Stone Roses' widely criticized Second Coming in comparison to their debut). Not only does Shaun of the Dead reference those numerous outside sources but it is self-referential as well, the whole second day of the movie being an almost word-for-word recurrence of the first with the dialogue providing a hilarious irony that takes several viewings of the film to fully appreciate. To make things better, the cast's comic timing is superb to the point of almost being able to work telepathically with each other and Edgar Wright's use of camera angles and distinct images not only pays respects to the classics that he so reveres but also demonstrates his enormous talent in creating films with a style all his own. Shaun of the Dead is easily the most rewarding movie of its kind for at least a decade and one can only hope that the excellent output from the geniuses behind it will continue long into the 21st century"
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,Entertaining Moive,"The Hot Spot is an incredibly hit, with the various positive elements in the film hurt by a seriously overlong running time. The most effective aspect of the film is Johnson's performance. By shedding his usual cocky grin and confident swagger, he manages to turn Harry into a character that's so sleazy and self-serving he can't help but be fascinating. As he ambles into this small town, we get the sense that he believes it's the sort of place he could own - with the help of some conning and stealing. It's certainly an eye-opening performance.The movie is mostly entertaining"

dvd,,5.0,One of a kind.,"How do you describe a movie like ""Shaun Of The Dead""? Well, that's the hard part, because there really isn't anything else out there like it. The writing is incredibly smart...mixing comedy, horror and even a bit of drama all together so well. it's a movie that can't be classified, as anything other then just a GREAT film. There are moments that make you laugh out loud, followed by, and sometimes mixed with scenes that are genuinely creepy and unsettling. And towards the end, there are some truly touchingly sad moments. I give immense credit to star/co-writer Simon Pegg & director/co-writer Edgar Wright. I just wish there were more movies like ""Shaun Of The Dead"" being made these days; ones that are as entertaining and intelligent. Going to the movies would be a lot more fun"

The Surrealists felt that one of the keys of art lay in our dreams, and the intro to this show seems like a happy nightmare of sorts.  The music, Pee Wee's odd vocal interjections, the variety of visual images, the introduction of the strange group of inhabitants living in the playhouse, all combine to announce to the would-be viewer that his was a show that wasn't going to go down any path that had been traveled by any previous show."

She has some serious vocal affections that hinder her natural sound and distort her pop croonings (she comes off as a Britney wannabe). Interestingly her more tepid and boring tunes from In This Skin sound the best (including ""My Way Home""). Her rendition of ""Take My Breath Away"" is decent, as is the touching ""You Don't Have to Let Go"" (her ""I can love because you love...me"" is nothing less than beautiful), but her awful performance of ""Angels"" falls extremely short of expectations (she sounded much better on VH1's Divas Live). In the end, her Reality Tour 2004 is a decent but much less stellar concert given by a girl who does have talent. Throw out that Britney-trademarked growl, Jessica, and the odd vocal quirk that makes it sound as though she's choking back a song rather than singing it and you can soar. Decent, but not great."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,What Romantic Comedies Should Be,"This is the good side of Hollywood. Wholesome, clean, romantic, and funny. A film one can watch with the entire family without embarrassment. One that couples can watch together, and feel good about relationships. Definitely the type of story for Meg Ryan. Her best work since ""When Harry Met Sally"" without the strong language. And the perfect chemistry with her best leading man Tom Hanks. "

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The best TV show ever,"At least it's my favorite. It works as a comedy, as an adventure, as a romantic story, as a mystery and as great entertainment. The show made Bruce Willis a star and deservedly so. Cybill Shepard had a part that fit her skills perfectly. The show didn't produce that many new episodes and the arrival of a new episode was an event. The show took wild risks and although not every one worked perfectly, its fans loved them for trying to do something more than an ordinary TV show. There has never been a show like this one - unique, original and always entertaining. If you've never seen this, you're in for a treat"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A Waltz for a Night,"So, we continue with the psychosexual primer for guys (How to Get the Girl of Your Dreams in One Easy Step).  I know that women may value this movie, which is natural, but I found an extraordinary number of guys falling for this ""romance.""  I like they, could relate wholly or not at all.  The script may seem boring for Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but that is only true when you find the concept of being alone with a beautiful woman in an intense one-on-one boring.  This concept may be terrifying to some guys.  Otherwise, you will find the patience to endure the cinematic buildup to the inevitable end: The soul mates converge."

dvd,,4.0,Imprint: Good Horror Movie,"Scary! The really gross sort of scary too. Not a wise idea to watch it alone on a stormy night. That's what I did & had bad dreams because of it. Yeah, the acting wasn't great, but I feel it was good enough for this kind of movie. An actor who was a demon on the tv show Charmed played the main character. I thought the story was pretty clever & interesting. It kept you on the edge of your seat. You never knew what to expect.  Watch this if your looking for it good scare. "
dvd,2 of 5,2.0,There's pushing the envelope of filmaking and the artful ,"depiction of ""reality"", and then there's the perverted vision of Larry Clark. Being a fan of Bully and by no means someone who shy's away from sex in media, I was thoroughly disappointed by Clark's latest offering. No real plot. Just a hodge podge of unusually dysfunctional characters connected only by their age and their locality. One can't help but think that the constant theme of adolescent sexuality in Clark's films is indicative of some personal demons and temptations the director must be grappling with. You can argue that many of the over the top characters and scenes in Ken Park do exist and take place in real life and you would be right. There are mother's cheating on their husbands with teenage boys, there are overbearing religious families that inadvertently push their kids to the opposite end of the morality spectrum and there are certainly kids who kill their parents/grandparents. But what's the purpose of the movie's characters? To demonstrate teenage angst and they way people push the limits of sexual boundaries? To see that you'd be better off watching an hour and a half of Jerry Springer epsiodes which would arguably have as much continuity and plot development as Ken Park.   "

She is filled with a love of her music. I only hope that she stays that way. The fact that she has a great relationship with all her family is her only hope that she will stay well grounded and ""Pure"". When you consider all the so-called US ""Stars"" that started off ""Pure"" and have since reveiled a hardened ""Porn-Like"" Character not at all Pure We can only hope and pray that she travels a different road through fame and fortune!  At this point in her short life she seems to care less about the fortune part of the equasion.  That is good.  If I had a daughter I would be thrilled with one like her!"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,We're Going to Be Extinct.,"JURASSIC PARK is one of the best, if not the best, movies made about dinosaurs ever.  It's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released.  It's also one of the first movies to use CGI in significant scenes throughout the film.  It's also the movie that gave Sam Neill a break and reinvigorated the career of Jeff Goldblum.  The movie (promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier) got the general public (and not just kids) excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK did to archaeology."

dvd,,5.0,A History of Violence: The Best Film (2005),"David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" is the type of film that you may not know how will wind up in the end, or what will happen next, but from the chilling starting sequence featuring what is the most violent image of the whole film, you know it's a film that's ready to raise your hairs, maybe for sheer pleasure or maybe because it's an exciting experience. The film probably shouln't be qualified as a thriller, even if it is a thriller and it is full of non cheap thrills and emotions, but as the modernization of westerns. It is, after all, a western. The character portrayed brilliantly by Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, and as the movie unravels we see that's he's no different to the Man with No Name or to Will Kane, for he is just the ""good"" cowboy, the man that we route for, the man that we want shoots the other men. As the movie advances, the plot doesn't thicken or gets more complex. As a matter of fact it's tough finding a plot so simple, yet so compelling and fun. The movie is quite fun, specially for those who like their movies to be charged with mordant black humor, and violence served in both spectacular showdowns and straight shots of blown away faces and blood splattered frames. "
dvd,,4.0,GREAT  DVD,"This was my 1st dvd  from the quick fix  series. I love this dvd. The choice of the 10 mintue workouts are just great.

dvd,,5.0,SHAKESPEAREAN HORROR,"Not much more can be said than has already been posted. It's an excellent film with excellent acting. Bring out this film when you need to be reminded what good acting, writing and directing are about.  As for it's 'R' rating, I think a high schooler would be able to watch the film but you'd have to determine if your child is too sensitive for the film.  Definitely watch it prior to and with your child"
dvd,7 of 9,4.0,"finally, an accurate high school movie !","forget about the social commentary or disturbing content.  the real reason this movie is good is because it has cute japanese schoolgirls violently murdering each other.  and at the end of the day, isnt that what every heterosexual male wants to see?

dvd,3 of 3,1.0,Not  as advertised -- and I can't take it Bach!,"Its DVD packaging claims that CRAZED ""features a fully nude lesbian scene between Daisy Duke herself Catherine Bach and critically acclaimed character actress Leslie Caron.""  I don't know how you define ""fully nude,"" but I would say it means ...duh...full nudity, not mere toplessness. CRAZED, which is being sold on the basis of this non-existent scene, not only lacks the promised full nudity from Bach -- *nobody* at all is fully naked. Furthermore, *there is no lesbian love scene at all* between any characters in this film! Troma, right on the package, says that ""because of this notorious scene, CRAZED has become one of the most sought-after movies on the cult-film circuit!"" What scene?! There is one small bit featuring Bach and Caron in a bedroom, but it cuts away while they are *fully-clothed*. In another, Bach is only topless, and only for a few seconds. There is no ""notorious scene"" in CRAZED -- only notoriously bad picture quality, the likes of which Troma has become known for, when it comes to the older films they unapologetically slap on DVD with little respect for the source material or customer. A more quality-cognizant company would explain on the package that the film was mastered from a poor print, so the buyer knows what he's (not)getting. Troma has released some fun films of its own in pristine condition, but the vast majority of its ""golden oldies"" look like they were pulled out of Lloyd Kaufman's toilet. In CRAZED, there is a  glitch or two in the picture that makes it look like a used video tape (which seems to have been the source). Unfortunately, DVDs are one of the few goods for which the misled consumer has no recourse. Once you open a DVD, no store will take it back on the basis of not-as-stated. Is that fair? What if you bought a dozen eggs and the carton contained 10? What if you purchased an ""antique"" that was sold to you on the basis of being 100 years old, but it was only a replica? I work hard for my money (never meaning to quote Donna Summer), and I resent the false claims made by Troma for CRAZED. Either Troma doesn't verify what's written on its own DVD packages or it knowingly misleads buyers with false promises of non-existent scenes just to part them with a couple of ten-dollar bills. It's a shame, because the movie itself is an arty erotic curio that would otherwise be worth owning"

I loved the book so much, I just couldn't wait to see the movie and I missed it theaters so I watched it this weekend from Netflix. What can I say? It's BORING! I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks, especially with this mullet-esque hair (it's ok to hate me), but I love Iam McCellan and Jean Reno, but these great actors just couldn't save this movie. And Sofie Neveau was SO much more interesting in the book. Don't waste your time on this one"
dvd,,5.0,Suspenseful,"This movie has all the perfect elements.  Hitchcock was robably beaming in his grave.  This movie has so many layers.  The moment you THINK you know what this story is about, it changes, and then changes again until the truth astonishes you.  I remember when I saw this movie in the theatre-I was just rivited to the screen.  Catching it on TNT so many years later, it still has the same effect.  The young teen screams don't have the corner market on suspense.  I wish there was more movies like this out there.  Bravo"

For one, it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into New York City circa 1959. Fox certainly has done a commendable job with the DVD--the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear. Cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch, because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by Deluxe brought to sparkling life. "

dvd,,4.0,"A strong Clint Eastwood movie, where retired FBI agent Terry McCaleb must deal with his new heart and a psychotic killer","Blood Work is a clever and satisfying mystery, in my opinion, with one drawback: The killer isn't all that hard to spot. On the other hand, the ""why"" of two of the killings is appalling, the police procedural aspect is interesting and it has the star quality of Clint Eastwood to power things along. More specifically, it has Eastwood taking full advantage of his age to play a retired FBI agent who has had a heart transplant, who is unwell, who keeps touching his chest in an uneasy awareness that what's there isn't his, who has to gulp pills and plot his temperature, and who often looks clammy and exhausted. At 72, this is the smart Clint Eastwood who some time ago decided to make his advancing years work for him, and not pretend to be an artificially preserved action hero."

A perfect introduction to the painter and for those quite familar with Bacon you will most likely recognize many of his statements - he often says the same things over and over (more or less) but its still very interesting to see him in action.  in addition the paintings and close-ups they show during the video are so much more fulfilling the reproductions.  i saw some paintings in a completely new light"

I have to disagree.  I started this video and tried to do all of the 5, ten minute sections.  It wasn't completely hard, but definitely challenging.  I am not the most fit person, but also not the most unfit.  I had a harder time because I am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video.  I am not saying I wouldn't suggest it, I am just saying it's not definitely for beginners.

He buys it! While he is returning some legal documents to her home vault, she lets him in on her suspicions that she believes that he killed her niece. She then slams the vault door shut where he suffocates. However, she is out witted by her victim. He ingeniuosly leaves a clue leading to his murderer. It's brilliant. There is not one episode, in this set, that is not enjoyable! I am soooo happy that my Columbo set is complete. Now, I can watch one of my favorite shows whenever I want.

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Excellent Report,"Set about fifty years into the future, the movie is a sci-fi/futuristic mystery that has a fair supply of intrigue and suspense.  Taking place in Washington D.C., in the year 2054 or so, is a new system of law called Pre-Crime.  The system hinders on pre-cogs, who are three gifted people who can see future murders.  Their visions are tapped into by futuristic technology and displayed before law enforcement.  John Anderton (T. Cruise) is the Chief of Pre-Crime, who trusts and enforces this system.  The system is demonstrated very impressively in the beginning of the film.  While Pre-Crime is excelling, so are the questions against it--especially from Danny Whitfer (C. Farrell) who turns out to be Anderton's main rival.  Anderton seeks advice and mentorship from the Pre-Crime creator: Burgess (M. Von Sydow), who is avid about seeing to it that Pre-Crime goes national."

dvd,4 of 4,4.0,A Love Story beautifully told,"The film that introduced Ingrid Bergman to American audiences is a beautiful re-make of the Swedish version (also starring Ingrid). Some viewers might find it too ""over the top"" dramatically in some places and dated in style but if you can put this aside - it's a real tearjerker. Leslie Howard (who I always found a bit 'weak' as an actor - or maybe it was the characters he played!) fits this role like a glove as the famous husband who falls hopelessly in love with his daughters piano teacher (played by Ingrid). I've seen the film countless times and it still moves me especially in the closing stages. It's very similar in theme to ""Brief Encounter"", so if you liked that, you should definitely give this a look especially as it's only relatively short (just a bit over 60 minutes)"

dvd,12 of 16,5.0,2000 Election Travesty,"What happened in the 2000 election was a travesty of momumental proportions. It is the stuff that usually is found in fiction novels but it happened right here in the USA; the country that proportedly sets the standard for Liberty and Democracy in the world. Unfortunately, our election process has been corrupted and this film shows how it happened. It is a shame that some people I have talked to admit that although it is most possible and probable that the fix was in, we are still better off with the person who won the presidency, so, no harm, no foul; nevermind there was wrongdoing and illegal practices. If we don't demand a paper trail in the next election I think it will cause so much disinfrancisement that the percentage of voters showing up at the polls will fall even more. After the last two elections I have no faith and believe we need to call in election observers from foreign countries.

I'm really not sure why it was done this way, but it is so I just want to make sure to avoid any confusion since there seems to be quite a bit."
dvd,1 of 2,1.0,Walt Disney Would Never Have Put His Name on This.,"""The Wild"" is under the ""Walt Disney Pictures"" banner, and even rated G, so I expected it to be a picture for the whole family, of which the studio is proud. I hoped it would put me in the Disney mood prior to our family trip to Walt Disney World."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,PHENOMENAL!!!!,This DVD was great! A lot of the matches were really awesome ones! My favorites were:
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon 2006,She Wore a Yellow Ribbon
dvd,0 of 17,4.0,abouut the movie Eros......,"The story is basically to show the beauty on how the approach of the exotic erotic moves is been presented in this films. The catchy moments at the start of the film is this sentence ""You never come in contact with a woman then how do you perform your tailor job""...bravo move by director Wong Kar Wai at the start of the film. (7/10 for this portion). A good recommendation for those whom are interested in this film. Book your ticket fast at your nearby theatre."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,A Great Romp for Fairy Tale Lovers...,"Despite the low opinions of most in regards to this film, I still thought it was a terrific romp through some of my favorite fairy-tales. "
dvd,4 of 4,2.0,John Boorman Misfires With A Heavy-Handed And Obvious Apartheid Drama,"""In My Country"" is certainly a well meaning film.  Filled with dignity, it means to explore the atrocities committed in the age of Apartheid.  Can justice be served?  Can South Africa move on?  How complicit is the average man?  There are certainly important topics and issues to be dealt with--but rarely have I seen them served up so falsely and dispassionately.  "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Escaflowne has it all,"this DVD is great! If your looking for anime that has action, suspence, romance, humor, and an engaging plot with lots of twists Escaflowne is the one to get. But makes sure you don't get the version fox kids puts out that version was hacked to death. Im my opinion the best version to come out is on DVD, it has great extras like music videos, and club escaflowne, and it has both English and Japanese soundtracks with subtitles"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Jamie shines under pressure,"It was quite refreshing to see Jamie in real day-to-day stuff, even managing to burn his own breakfast!  I've loved his previous dvds which are all about having a good  time.  Here, he's to be applauded for embarking on the monumental task of taking kids off the street and eventually turning them (some) into real chefs.  The patience he shows some of the kids, who time after time start to throw away this chance, is remarkable. But he does get mad. He does grow impatient, as do his old teachers and mentors.  He's got a lot riding on the line; his own money and his reputation.  But he never really makes it about him.  He genuinely cares about these kids. And inspite of his success and wealth, he seems to be the same old Jamie ever ready with a laugh.  It's also fascinating watching the students. Some grow and mature into their new role; something they knew nothing about the year before.  Others fall by the wayside and we know, as viewers, they'll one day look back on this opportunity and reget having made excuses to walk away.  "
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Intention Creates Invention,"""Imagination Is More Important Than Knowledge..."""
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991),"I loved the first one and I think, with the logic and plot of the first one, this follows through. We knew they changed the world, and in this sequel we see that. The actors do a good, since the lead characters are suppose to be, let's say less intelligent, but nice. I think this movie and the 1st one are classics. I like the grim reaper, his atitude during the movie, and the fact the he is the comic relief (okay so most of the movie is comic relief) Even if they are fun to watch to laugh at, it is worth it to watch"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Now this is not your typical thriller....,"Why not? Because the story is captivating, but not in a contrived way. The acting is excellent...much better than just average. The look of the film is top flight. The scenery is outstanding. And, of course, the suspense is awesome. See it if you can find it"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,John Grisham's novel brought to live by a stellar cast and preformances ,"     THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you. "
dvd,2 of 47,1.0,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen, even worse than citizen kane.  It is a movie about some bum who is a failure at life, and ends up playing one play during a football team.  This is a movie about failure and bothering other people to get what you want.  This movie just sucks.  Dont waste the time to watch this movie, cause this is time you will never get back. "
dvd,,2.0,"Confusing, too many characters, difficult to follow story line","Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clich� upon clich� is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the ""natural"" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk ""friend"" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship."
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,What a great workout!,"Over the years, I have purchased countless exercise videos and The Firm is definitely my favorite.  I own The Firm 1 (whole set) and this Firm 2 video.  This video is challenging and fun.  It is tough and definitely a good workout overall.  Each exercise transitions well into another.  The cardio is fun that includes a bit of kickboxing.  The weight training is more intense than The Firm 1.  I highly recommend this video.  I have always enjoy The Firm exercise video.  The only setback is, everytime The Firm comes out new videos, you are required to purchase a new equipment for their new workouts. "
dvd,,4.0,a slight problem,I was wondering if anyone has the same problem with these dvd boxsets
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"An immensely beautiful film, turned into a classic!","'Shane' is not a Western like Howard Hawk's 'Red River', nor a meditation on history and character like John Ford's ""The Searchers."" It is the most tasteful achievement ever invented to create a legend, an instant myth... Only Stevens' meticulously picturesque visuals and his evident desire to treat Western as art, could have mastered the archetypal simplicity and vitality of 'Shane.'"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Kathy Smith - Power Step Workout,I am a Kathy Smith fan and this is my favorite step video of her's. It really has three different ability levels and all three are a challenge.
dvd,2 of 6,2.0,good performances; not the most interesting stories,"Rebecca Miller spins three tales of woman who decide to take their lives into their own hands. In brief vignettes featuring three contemporary actresses (Kyra Sedgwick, Parker Posey and Fairuza Balk) escaping situations of largely their own making. I have never been particularly impressed with Kyra Sedgwick, but I felt that her role and performance was the standout among the three here. As an abused woman who finally had enough abuse, she decides to leave and take the lessons she learned in dealing with her abusive life to move forward, and she is excellent as much as she is convincing. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Break His Heart and I'll Break Your Face ... Memorable Line!,This was the most memorable line in the whole movie... when the tom girl in love with her best guy friend tells the popular girl to watch out! Hmmm... this should have been a signal that she was a keeper. The 80's was really captured in this movie and it signals the genres theme of teenage turmoil in a greedy decade. I'm glad the best friends ended up together. Sometimes it's true that our feelings run deep and we have no idea until a rival comes along
dvd,,5.0,DOH!=Awesome!,"Eighth season is fantastic! Now we get to the more ""out there"" stories. Chili contest. Mr. Burns as space alien. This box set just keeps giving and giving"
dvd,4 of 5,1.0,Appauling Quality,"This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to ""Angel heart""). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo ""Delta"" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term ""special edition"" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series)."
dvd,25 of 25,5.0,"Excellent toning for upper and lower body, with options to prevent plateaus","I got this DVD with the goal to increase my toning options - previous to this I only had Denise Austin's ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"", and this worked all sections of the body rather than having dedicated body part workouts."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Tom Hanks was ripped off!,"He should have won three Oscars in a row! This is better than Forrest Gump & Philadelphia, it has absolutely everything going for it. Cast, effects, writing, costume, music, cinematography, and most of all the fact that it is based on true events. So even though you know what happened it still is a thrilling ride - right until the end. "
dvd,,2.0,"Should be titled ""Spring Break Date Rape""","This seems like a movie that was supposed to be about teens going to the beach, getting drunk, and then having a date rape case for everyone to figure out.  Of course, if that sort of movie is going to have any dramatic impact at all, you have to have characters that someone could actually give a damn about.  This movie fails pretty thoroughly in that area, just like about 95% of movies these days.  Anyhow, at the last minute somebody apparently came up with the bright idea of making this a shark attack movie.  The sharks are barely in it at all, the date rape thing is really boring, the characters are paper thin cliches, and I personally couldn't care less if they got raped, went to prison, or if they got eaten by sharks."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,The Saint - Colour Series,The original B&W set were based on the Charteris stories and it shows. The colour series loses some of the charm of the 1st series. However the restored versions here and the colour are superb and the humour is always dry! A good buy
dvd,,5.0,Greats !!!!,I can say GOOD terror movie !!! U keep in suspense until the end . Buy this movie 
dvd,,2.0,Uneven Movie,This movie had two things going for it; Sarah Jessica Parker and Craig T. Nelson.  
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Stunning,"I'm not a big fan of `kicking and punching' films. My partner is... so I've grown immune to them, to some degree. But Hero is one film that stands above all the others I've endured. The action is... well, the action you always get in this kind of film, but there's also so much more. A tender love story, plot twists, and some of the most stunningly beautiful cinematography you'll ever see. The colours, the flowing movements, the locations... it's like opening a box of chocolates and seeing all your favourites. Wonderful"
dvd,,5.0,Fresh and Funny Jabs at Hollywood,Sharply written and delivered one-woman show that goes right after Hollywood and all of its resident alien creatures and craziness. 
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,It's About time - Hey you 99-500 dollar ripoffs Eat your DVD,"Thank God!! 3 stories starring Karen Black, with the third one the most famous with the Zuni Fetish Warrior. Worth the price of the DVD for just the third story"
dvd,,4.0,So excited! Now a little let down.,I was SO. EXCITED. for this release when I heard about it. I ran right over and pre-purchased it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive.
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Confirm your invitation now," The black cloud of the Great Depression shadows every scene and every character in DINNER AT EIGHT, George Cukor's brilliant adaptation of the hit Broadway play (it didn't hurt that the play was written by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, or screenwrit by Frances Marion and Herman Mankiewicz.  This is a smart and slick production.) I write that with a trace of wonderment.  I remember the comedy - I saw this movie years ago - but the serious undertones, the prominent minor chords, I didn't remember, and they caught me by surprise."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,ENDURING CLASSIC,"Even though this movie has some ""miles"" on it...It never seems to be ""dated""..the story is still full of suspense...and even though we have seen it several times..it never grows old.  We live in a small fifth wheel..fulltime and this is one of the movies we both voted to take with us for those rainy days!  A ""must-have"" for anyone who loves movies"
dvd,4 of 4,2.0,Long Gray Line,The movie overall is really a great story; the quality of the DVD is what really is what I find as poor quality.  It's almost as though some one  copied it using a video camera recorder.  I already own a copy of the VHS tape and it is a far better version of the film.  The actors are classics.  I can only say good things about Maureen O'Hara and Tyrone Powers.  Ward Bond also.  There were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention; still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of Americana that deserves remembering.
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Classic,"One of the best films I have ever seen.  Sorry I never got around to seeing this one sooner.  Impressive acting and phenomenal direction make this film the best ever made on the topic of coping with illness in a family or otherwise.  George Miller also directed Witches of Eastwick, Road Warrior, Babe Pig in the city...Talk about versatility.  He has an unbelievable control of the moving image with this film...I am in awe"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,"Good content, but needs a more attractive style",I am a HUGE fan of Edward Norton and the environment (not necessarily in the same order as stated). I worry a lot about our mother Earth and the days to come. I think after establishing the strategic balance of horror (nuclear weapons) humans are now able to look around and see the new challenge. 
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Even Better Than I Remembered!,"I grew up watching this show and I loved it back then. It's just as good now, with the added benefit of being hugely nostalgic!"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,I beg to differ,"Others here have called this film ""dated."" Any film from this period is ""dated"" including Citizen Kane. Someone else called this Mr. Reagan's finest performance. Actually, his finest performance is in ""Kings Row"", but I am sure these same folks would find that film ""dated"" as well."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful Series,"I love this series. I remember hearing about it when it first aired, but unfortunately I didn't pay attention to it. I rented it a while back and the DVDs were distorted, but I saw enough of it, to know I wanted to own. Amazon had it listed for a great price $16, so I immediately bought it. I would reccommend you buy this DVD, there isn't another show like this. It's funny, smart and entertaining"
dvd,7 of 9,2.0,"Extreme disappointment as with ""Burn!"" DVD release","[star rating above is for DVD only (gave them an extra * just for releasing the title); movie itself = *****] I've waited 7 years for this Sidney Lumet masterpiece to appear on DVD. The transfer here is non-anamorphic, non-progressive 1.66:1. Cruddy. 12 total chapter stops for a 2-hour film."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Great flick!!!,"This is truly a wonderful film that really gets to the heart of family and parenting.  It also has a lot of comedy added in the mix of it, so it makes the film that much more enjoyable.  I have loved this movie since I was a kid, and I still love it today!  The only reasons I rated the 'product' 4 stars is because it has not been released in a WIDESCREEN version!  I am not a fan of full screen!  I actually like to watch the whole movie, so if this one is ever released as a wide screen, I will be buying it again!  I always have family member I can give the other version to"
dvd,,5.0,Perry does it again!!!," Even if you don't like plays, your tummy will hurt after watching this one. Perry combines humor rolled in with common sense and good messages like an expert sushi chef. Don't be suprised if you find yourself looking for other movies of his the next time you visit the video store. This one will sneak up on you!!!"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,And they are out in Eight Men Out ,"In the early 1920's, the baseball world was shocked by a scandel, when 8 players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox team was accussed of throwing the world series. The players were Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn), Buck Weaver (John Cusack), ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson (D.B. Sweeney), Fred McMullin (Perry Lang) , Lefty Williams (James Read), Chick Gandil (Michael Rooker) , Hap Felsch (Charlie Sheen), and Ray Schalk (Gordon Clapp). These 8 players I am sure you all know of, was suspended from playing baseball in the Major Leagues for life for thier part in the crime, even if the jury had aquitted them. The movei starts before the World Series happens, and before we get into see a deal, or talk between players and gamblers, but mor names get added on in the deal, and they are each paid a certain amount of money each for each game in the World Series. The White Sox was considered in this season team in baseball, and was favorly favored to win the World Series, but in yet these players took thier turn in games, while they team met the Cinncianti Red Stockings, and look who turns out to win the World Series, whcih should make it easy to review this movie, and even if you know of the scandal that took place and broke the hearts of kids in America, and even the Chicago White Sox fans, the movie runs about 2 hours long, which even takes some time, before we get to see the World Series games, the trail bacially happened in 1921, even if it is seen in ths movie between 1919 and 1920, but White Sox and history buiffs should enjoy this movie.     "
dvd,,2.0,MacGyver on stupid pills,"As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action"
dvd,,4.0,Another Underrated Classic, This is the type of movie you will turn on by chance in the middle of the night when you are about to go to sleep and after a few minutes you are hooked and end up staying up another couple hours and next thing you know it's morning and you still haven't gotten to sleep - it is that good. Well done all around and an especially strong performances from both Wood Harris and Cam'Ron - the realism just blew me away. At first glance it doesn't look like much but that's about as far from the truth as you can get - a definite pick-up
dvd,25 of 34,5.0,Fantastic family Christmas movie!!,The movie itself is one of the all time classic family Christmas movies and should not be missed.
dvd,3 of 4,1.0,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,I like Sandler.
dvd,10 of 30,5.0,NFL FIlms does it again....,"NFL Films continues to dish out great Super Bowl DVDs. Everything from the Super Bowl Box Sets to the New England Patriots home videos, to the 3 games to glory Patriots DVD 2 disc set to the Steelers Super Bowl XL DVD and now this."
dvd,,5.0,good sad and scary.,For me this movie is good to watch at night. robin williams plays A photo developer a very lonly person who is obcessed with a young family and he steals copies of their photos he processes for them and hangs it on his wall in his half empty appartment. He has crazy fantasys of him being part of that family. He stalks the kid and the mother. And his store manager finds out he is stealing photos so he lets him go and he gets so depressed and before he leaves he finds pictures of the womans husband cheating on her so he switches the photos for the woman to see and the best part I liked was when sy breaks in their hotel and pretends he is taking pornographic pictures. best drama movi
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Bad Guy...another point of view,"First, I must complement the other reviews, they are very descriptive and accurate in covering the movie.  The only points I have to add are the following:"
dvd,,4.0,"Good Movie, Bad rep from gamers. (3.5 stars)","All I want to say about the movie, seeing as how it already has been touched on by 670 something people before me is that this film is beautiful and deep and entertaining. The negative things that people say are unwarranted i.e. ""The faces have no emotion"" actually they have alot of expressions, the cgi is exceptional and there is a fine range of emotion. The biggest complaint people have is that the movie isn't ""Final Fantasy"", this is of course coming from those people that love the RPG games and think anything attached to the ""Final Fantasy"" title has to have ""swords and potions"". I'm just trying to tell you guys that this film explores a beautifully animated and completely realized world and alot of work was put into the film. Almost anyone with an open mind is bound to enjoy this movie and acknowledge how hard the filmmakers worked to bring it to the screen. "
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,(:D) its good for me,I use to be a  dancer. I danced for 10 years and quit because of the pressure of being good and etc and i don't regert it but i do miss it a little. I'm addicted to dance movies. This one is one of the best I've seen Great thats all i have to sa
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,The 50s captured perfectly,"For those who were not there, this film really does capture the 50s teen experience. The cars, the dress, the town, the attitudes are all perfectly rendered. "
dvd,,4.0,The Protectors (Ending Song),The Protectors ending song belongs to Tony Christie's Avenues and Alleyways (1973)
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Has Heart,"My mother had came in on part of the movie when my son made a comment. He shared how he really enjoyed the movie and would be a great addition to the martial arts collection. He was right.Van Damme is truly more human in this role.  I recommend this to anyone looking for action and drama, Van Damme style"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Hysterically funny classic!!,"This is probably one of the best Cary Grant films ever!  Its premise is silly, the family  all delighfully crazy (with the 'frightening' exception of brother Jonathan).  It's rumored that Grant wasn't particularly pleased with the results for this movie - he believed that he had over-acted.  While that IS true, it is with uncompromisingly funny results!  It's a classic with good reason."
dvd,3 of 7,5.0,A gangster-film landmark,"Alain Delon sets the standard for ""cool killer"" characters in film. His performance marks the beginning of gangster as fashion icon, paving the way for Beatty & Dunaway in ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Smart, thrilling, and entertaining.",It is nice to find a movie that believes that its viewers have an IQ over 60.  Hollywood doesn't make enough of these types of movies.
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Epic,"A powerful, sweeping movie that makes a character out of the Russian landscape, Doctor Zhivago is about a man broken by the times he inhabits.  Set around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution we're introduced to our main players - Zhivago, the good doctor; Tonya, the faithful wife; and Lara, the beauty who steals men's hearts.  The three and a half hour run time allows plenty of room for side plots, but the main tale is of Zhivago's path crossing with Lara on several occasions - through chance, through war, and through communist desperation - and how his marital fidelity is eventually defeated."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent!,"Having lived through the coverage of the slaughtered Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics, I felt like I was experiencing the actual events as they were occurring over again.  Speilberg did an excellent job using stock news footage from the tragedy and overlaying actors into recreated scenes.  Though these events are actually shown piecemeal throughout the film, the actual story is about what transpired afterwards.  The Israeli government hired a hit squad to track down and eliminate 11 individuals that participated in the planning of the terrorist action at the Olympics."
dvd,1 of 16,2.0,Not one of Specner's Tracy's best performances.,"The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting.  But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance.  I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this.  He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Rejuvinated Series,This season has brought the show back on track to be once again interesting and exciting.  Season 8 kind of felt like the show was winding down to an end.  Season nine has rekindled the excitement of the show making you want more seasons
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Clever satire and quite funny too,"I only worked in one office for a month and I can relate to a lot of things in this movie: the printer that barely worked at times, the overdemanding boss, the rules and regulations and that feeling that any kind of profit and you're not going to see a dime from it. Unlike certain comedy movies which are based primarily on being disgusting, rude or people getting smacked by things, Office Space gets its laughs by moments where you go ""I know someone exactly like that""."
dvd,1 of 6,1.0,One star is too much,"Very disappointing.  Little is said of the expansion era, which could of been great considering WWE ownes most wrestling footage that exists"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Love this Series!,I was greatly disappointed when they took the show off the air..I'm so glad I thought to look it up online!  It is a quirky and thought provoking show but not pompous or self righteous.  Love it!!!! 
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,what happened to to the picture quality!!!!!!,"i give the season four stars. but the dvds get 2 stars. what happend!!! The WB got cheap, the new package sucks its higher than the others and not the same inside. That i could handle,  but what really sucks is that the picture quality looks like VHS!The first 2 seasons looked great. But the third looks like im actually watching them in 1991! In a way it feels old school, but dam we are in the dvd age and i wish they looked good like the first 2 seasons. i hope they go back to the old packaging and remastering in the 4th season"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Fantastic - Full Length & All Music - This Is The One To Own,"Great childhood pictures of Karen and her brother. This video is non-stop music combined with photos and videos from the past. Especially for those who heard the Carpenters on the radio day after day, this video is a real treat."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Young Fatal Attraction,"This movie is great. I just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it. I throughly enjoyed it entirely, I believe it kind of relates to Fatal Attraction"

dvd,6 of 18,1.0,BOB SAGET IS THE ANTI-CHRIST,BOB SAGET WANTS TO EAT YOUR CHILDREN - DO NOT SEE HIS MOVIE
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,The Immigrant Experience as Greek Tragedy. ,"""House of Strangers"" is based on the novel ""I'll Never Go There Again"" by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and novelist Jerome Weidman, who wrote about the immigrant experience in New York City in the early 20th century, particularly the Jewish immigrant experience. This screenplay is credited solely to Philip Yordan, but director Joseph Mankiewicz actually wrote the final version of the script. Jerome Weidman's book is about a Jewish banking family who were changed to Italians for the film. If that was in order to avoid controversy, it didn't quite work. The Giannini family, who founded Bank of America, complained to 20th Century Fox that the family in the film resembled theirs. But they were outdone by the studio chairman himself, Spyrus Skouras, who thought the fictional Monetti family was his. So he limited the film's release. That's unfortunate, because ""House of Strangers"" has some wonderful performances, including one that earned Edward G. Robinson a Best Actor award at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival."
dvd,,5.0,Tai Chi for Health: Yang Long  Form,I find it very easy to follow
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Pretty good,"I liked the DVD set to be honest. It however did remind me of the History of the Undertaker 3 disc set. The whole thing comes off as a way for WWE to make a buck(which that is the whole point in selling merchandise in the first place) than something special. JR hosts and introduces the matches but he seems so stiff doing it. On the other hand, I enjoyed the match selection, especially on disk 2 & 3. Some of tehse matches I had already seen or didn't care that much to watch anyway, but I was glad to see them. I would say this is a great set for new WWE fans. Atleast discs 2 & 3 are. Soem may get bored wi th the matches from the 70's and 80's."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Lives up to expectation,Better than what you see on TV because there are no commercials.  My kids and I have a lot of fun watching this
dvd,,4.0,Excellent Audio Commentary by Stephen Prince,"I knew that Akira Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" (1980) had some basis in history, but I didn't know how much until I listened to this DVD's audio commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince (""The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa"").  According to Prince, virtually the entirety of the film's story is based on historical events -- the major exception being the character of the thief who acts as the double of Shingen, the warlord.  However, Shingen, a historical figure, had employed doubles in real life, so Kurosawa's fictionalizing of the title character isn't that much of an embellishment.  "
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,No rollerskates-All woman!,"   I'd never given a great deal of attention to Heather Graham because mostly she seemed to be constantly cast in rolls that didn't give her much latitude.  I've always been attracted to those BIG eyes and wondered if she'd ever get a roll with some real meat on the bone.  Yes, those eyes and so much more!  And she really can act!  Aside from the great looking cast, this story also has some meat to savor!  I was so surprised at the compeling flow of this movie. A well made little piece that will not disappoint!  I hope some studio will give Heather more serious vehicles in the near future. I may have to buy a couple more copies since I know a couple of friends who would really enjoy this movie as a gift"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,In-home workout for just about anyone,"If you are at home and don't want to walk outside (maybe the weather is lousy), this is a perfect 2 DVD set that takes you from a 1 mile walk to a walk with hand-held weights for bone-strengthening and intensity. It can all be done in a small room in front of your DVD player and television."
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,Stonewall Jackson's Way,"Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done.  Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.   Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.   The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.   Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential ""Stonewall"" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.   For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.   It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.   Admirers of ""Stonewall"" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with ""Stonewall"" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.   His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.   It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.  "
dvd,,4.0,GOOD SUBJECT,"I enjoyed the play, young people really need to watch this, to know what marriage is about"
dvd,,4.0,Love Ashley?  Love Morgan?,"If you are a fan of either Ashley Judd or Morgan Freeman, you should like this movie.  I am a fan of both of them so I loved this movie.  Sure there are holes in the plot.  Yeah, you can see the twist at the emd coming.  So what?  Ashley is terrific and Morgan is lovable.  They have fantastic on screen chemistry.  Add to that another of my favorite actors, Jim Caviezel and for some of us 'High Crimes' becomes a can't miss flick.  I gave it 4 stars for the plot holes.  Could have been 5 stars easily.  "
dvd,,5.0,Another Great Video from Montreux,I own about 6 DVDs that were recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival. I am amazed that the video and especially the audio quality of them. They must have staged mikes all over and sent them to invidual channels when they taped. I am very pleased with the 5.1 audio mix. 
dvd,2 of 4,4.0,A Very Good Noir with Some Flaws,"I like Denzel Washington, have ever since his ""St. Elsewhere"" days, though I've never thought he radiated the all-time star quality so many people declare he does -- just stacked up against the mediocrity of contemporary acting and filmmaking, he shines.  He's a likable presence, savvy and natural before the camera, but he's still no Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, or Sidney Poitier.  Nonetheless, his performance in ""The Mighty Quinn"" as a smooth, mostly law-abiding Caribbean police chief investigating a gruesome murder deserves even more accolades than it typically gets.  Despite a wandering accent (still not as bad as Kevin Costner's in ""Robin Hood""), it ranks among his best and holds the film together, which is no mean feat considering the plot and execution are sometimes uneven.  As with the best film noirs, the actual mystery in ""The Mighty Quinn"" takes a back seat to the exploration of Quinn's personal life, which in stereotypical fashion is in shambles in spite of and because of his bravado.  His marriage is strained, his childhood friend (Robert Townshend) is the chief suspect in the murder, and his aspirations for political mobility are dashed.  There's also a shabby American (M. Emmet Walsh) poking about, suggesting he may be something other than an eccentric tourist, and the wife of a bigwig (Mimi Rogers) putting out more sexual temptations than Quinn needs at this point in his life.  When it all works -- and it frequently does -- ""The Mighty Quinn"" is eminently watchable, as breezy and rich with music and local color as a good vacation (the bits with characters in the police station are among the film's finer moments, as is a rendition of the titular song).  When it doesn't, as with an incidental soundtrack that assumes we're too dumb to understand what's going on or with a climax that undercuts the smartness of the rest of the mystery, the film feels schizophrenic.  There are some nice visual allusions, including three blind men walking the streets to music, a la ""Dr. No,"" and one must wonder whether Walter Mosley was inspired by the book upon which this film was based.  And despite its flaws, ""The Mighty Quinn"" stands up to repeat viewings, mostly because of Washington"
dvd,2 of 7,5.0,That's So Raven Rocks!!!!,Hey~ i bought this dvd and its really great!!.. owh~ Mannn!!! i totally love That's So Raven~~~~~~~~~ you'll never regret of buying That's So Raven DVD~ i think TSR should make a DVD BOX SET for every season!! (just like lizzie mcguire) and i will be the first person to buy That's So Raven DVD BOX SET... but please!! please!! im hoping that that's so raven dvd will come out more soon!!!
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Touching, but HORRIBLE cover","I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this film, apart from the fact we just got it in work, and I thought why not? Anna Paquin is really nice, and Jeff Daniels is an alright actor, although I haven't seen him too much in films, apart from Dumb & Dumber & Speed obviously! "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,One of the Best Anime's Ever,"This is one of the best anime's of all-time, not only for the animation, but for all the layers of psychology in the story.  Sometimes it's hard to know what's going on, but that's part of the amazing atmosphere.  "
dvd,25 of 28,5.0,Lucrecia Martel: An Argentinean Filmmaker in the Vein of Bu�uel and Almod�var,"Lucrecia Martel is one gifted artist.  Her latest film, 'La Nia santa' (The Holy Girl) was conceived, written and directed in a style that is a tough and puzzling of Luis Buuel and Pedro Almodvar: what you see on the screen is an enigmatic mixture of sexuality and spirituality, comedy and drama, polemics and parody, all woven together in a fascinatingly beautiful story that demands a lot from the audience. Martel is a talent of enormous potential and magnitude."
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Great exercise video for kids!,"I purchased this for my 4-year-old son, and we love it.  The moves are very easy to follow and extremely non-violent.  He compares the martial arts moves to picking apples and oranges versus upper cuts and jabs.  The kids in the video are just kids -- they don't perform everything perfectly so as not to make your little feel incompetent.  Great for all ages"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,It's easy to love a series where you can tell...,"The writers put creativity and thought into the plots. CSI is by far one of the best tv shows that's ever graced the screen. The characters are excellent, great chemistry, wonderful dialogue and wit. Gruesome gory crimes that just scream realism. I absolutely LOVE CSI"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,a great band near their prime,great pictures. great sounds. great band.
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,The Best Movie of The New Millenium,This film is what indipendent moviemaking is all about.
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,BEST OF THE BEST,"Wow!!! Somebody has a real chip on their shoulder... F word this and that. Well look I am no mormon, and we watch movies with an open mind, because it's fantasy. Yeah the movie was heavy with vulagarities, but it comes with the territory."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Better than you think!," This is a legend,  not historical fact.  But especially if you are Irish and English as I am-------and especially if you just plain love historical myth or drama with fantastic cinematography,  then this is the movie for you.  Sophia Myles (Isolde) is great,  and Rufus Sewell as the warlord who seeks to unite England is very convincing.    Critics have been hard on this movie because James Franco (Tristan) is not a modern kind of lover----------but what do you want out of a warrior coming out of the Dark Ages who has seen his whole family butchered.   Tristan himself has an appropriate darkness about him,  yet he fights with great heart and fits into the movie well,  rather than stealing the show so that more teenage girls will go see this movie.       This film puts all the pieces together very well.  I wish the critics would get some sense and love of history,  before they butcher a movie like this.  I take it a little personally,  because it is precisely this kind of film that I want producers to make more of"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,wow,"I walked into this series knowing nothing about it.  A friend had told me to pick it up one day and said that she highly recomeded it.  I asked her what it was about and she replied only with a smile.  I can tell you one thing.  I sat through the entire series with my jaw on the floor.  I was in awe of the story line and characters at every turn.  At first it seemed to resemble a few other animes that I have seen but after the first few episodes it veres sharply to the right and starts carving a new path through the mountain.  Its characters are an odd assortment to say the least.  They are definatly not your typical anything.  They are way out in left field on all terms.  One minute your sitting there thinking, ""no way theyre going to.....oh holy s**t they did.""  or your sitting there thinking ""this could be even better if.....wow this DVD just read my mind"".  Tha animation in the series is well done.  There are a few instances where it seems rushed and missing a few inbetweens but over all it holds up fairly solid and consistant.  All in all I highly recomend for any horror/scifi fan.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you wondering, what the h*ll just happened.  And not to worry the ending is acctually good!! it doesnt have a cop out ""evangelion/razephon"" ending.  It wraps everything up in a nice little bow and makes you glad that you sat through the series. "
dvd,31 of 32,5.0,SECOND SEASON OF A 70'S CLASSIC... great fun!!!,"I was just a kid when this show was on... and I loved every episode of it. Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show..."
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,Badly marketed on release...this is a smart thriller,"The movie ""Venom"" is not so much a scary monster movie as it is an intelligent and involving thriller. In fact the black mamba (reportedly the worlds deadliest snake) has very little screen time and serves merely as a device to move along the plot and raise the tension level of a household held hostage by ciminals and under siege by police. "
dvd,,4.0,UNIQUE & BEAUTIFUL !,This film is just another example of Argento's supremely atmospheric & visualy beautiful artwork! In this movie he  displays some of the most artistic & groundbreaking murder scene's to ever grace the bloody screen. Its such a unique & beautiful piece of art! Noone can make a creepy painting come to life like Dario Argento
dvd,,5.0,Allen's black & white masterpiece.,"Manhattan directed by self-obsessed genius Woody Allen is brilliant, beautifully written, and wonderfully acted. Could Diane Keaton be any cuter?! She is such a natural and talented actress. I was pleasantly surprised by young Mariel Hemingway's vulnerable and very mature performance, she plays Tracy, Allen's 17 year old girlfriend in the film. I love the look on Allen's face at the end of the film (you'll know what I mean when you see it, priceless!) Manhattan explores the ups and downs of so-called committed relationships. My three top Allen films are of course Manhattan followed by Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. Manhattan is breathtaking to look at, Allen's camera angles are defintely unorthodox, especially in the numerous car scenes and in his apartment. Buy Manhattan today"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Brings me back...,"I had two favorite Halloween classics growing up; Young Frankenstein and Arsenic and Old Lace. Arsenic is entertaining and hilarious in it's absurdity. Cary Grant's charm and grace is at a peak in this film, and his humor is without fail. A definite must see"
dvd,,5.0,time travel," i loved this movie, it absolutely takes you back in time.it is very succinct and exciting"
dvd,99 of 101,2.0,Quality of transfers is disappointing - trash along with just o.k. transfers - most can be found in better quality elsewhere,"50 westerns, seems like a bargain?!  Well... maybe, depending on your tolerance for sub-par film transfers.  There are some great films here to be sure, but at least a third are pretty bad transfers, and the rest are mostly just marginal at best. Virtually all of the more commonly available films offered here can be found in significantly better quality elsewhere."
dvd,,5.0,A Classic Not to be Missed,"This is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book.  The cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous.  This film will delight both children and adults with it's adventure, suspense, and innocent romance.  It's a little spooky in some scenes, but of the fun rather than truly scary kind.  This story has a very positive underlying message but doesn't preach, rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the Secret Garden and of themselves.   No matter what age you are, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, uplifting, perhaps even transformative film - don't miss it"
dvd,23 of 23,4.0,Abs section is good; Buns only okay,"The set, outfits and Tamilee's hairstyle look quite dated, as this was filmed in the 1990s. However, the abs section is pretty good and some parts of the buns section are tough."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,The funniest play he wrote yet!,"I love to watch the Madea plays they are so funny but yet still send out a message to people. This play was funny all the way. My favorite line off the whole play was ""Hello can I speak to Scooby Doo"". This was a great play. Tyler Perry doin the thing. They should make a movie off of this play, hopefully they will"
dvd,2 of 6,1.0,Is anyone ELSE tired of stereotypes??,"   This movie is just terrible; even more than MOST of the predictably terrible films in this genre.  Women with terrible haircuts, dirty homes filled with poor taste in furniture, jobs a 16 year old would have - or no jobs at all, awkward behavior, barely able to function socially...UH+GH!  The truth is, there are gay women out there who look great, have beautiful homes, have very progressive and meaningful careers, have talent and are entertaining and sexy.  WHO SAYS this is representative??  Not in MY world it isn't.  I am so sick of these painful displays of us.  Anyone who gave it over 2 stars is childishly defending the genre in general, and not talking about this stinker of a film.    "
dvd,,4.0,It was good,A fancy high school with students in their 30's. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Lots of good laughs. 4 stars because I didn't like the ending
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"Graphic , well paced , dramatization of the Jack The Ripper story",The Hughes Brothers created a nightmarish vision of Victorian London only matched by some of Dickens novels. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are fabulous as the police inspector investigating the case and a prostitute who is a friend to the victims.
dvd,,5.0,Fabulous!,Can't wait for Season 4 to come out!  I now have the first 3!
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"Still too much Bruce Lee and not enough Sherlock Holmes, but still (by far!) the best live-action rendition of Batman to date","Being a longtime fan of the Batman comics, I have definite ideas about what a Batman movie should be.  I am pleased to report that Batman Begins is pretty close to my definition of a good Batman movie - it's certainly the first incarnation of a live-action Batman that I would recommend to friends.  The story - millionaire heir Bruce Wayne witnesses his parents deaths at the hands of a mugger.  He ends up wandering the world looking for a purpose and comes across the formidable and enigmatic Ra's al Ghul, head of a centuries-old organisation dedicated to cleaning up corruption and decadance (they claim to have caused the sack of Rome, for example).  He trains in a variety of martial arts, returning to Gotham City (a fictional city ""between NYC and NJ"") to start his life of crimefighting.  His first target - mob kingpin Carmine Falcone.  His second mission - to save Gotham from Ra's's mad plan to raze the city as an example to the world."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Wowsers!,"Like many viewers I've been waiting for the real thing on DVD--and here it is! Don Adams (Get Smart, Tennessee Tuxedo) did a great job on this series. It's a smart, action-packed limited animation cartoon that draws you in. As many reviewers have commented, this is DIC's motherlode. But it's not the only DIC 'toon I'd like to see on DVD. I watched Dennis the Menace every day and there was a great one called Little Shop spun off of Little Shop of Horrors. Also Sabrina from Savage Steve Holland (and where's Eek the Cat from the FOX network?)"
dvd,11 of 13,5.0,HE COULD HAVE BEEN A CONTENDER...,"This HBO original movie tells the story of street basketball legend, Earl ""The Goat"" Manigault. The film opens up with Lakers legend, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, stating that the greatest player he ever saw was ""The Goat"". "
dvd,,5.0,One of the BEST of its kind,"In Adaptation, Robert McKee tells Nicolas Cage's character that the reason he can't write a successful script based on Meryl Streep's character's story, is because she is lying, and a story where the characters don't act truthfully can't work. But Capturing the Friedmans is successful despite the fact that the boys clearly are lying about something. In fact, people can't stop thinking about this film. Jarecki cleverly shows that as characters who lie, the Friedmans act very logically as they assume textbook roles of the codependent family model."
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Magnificent!,"WOW!  I had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful, haunting score to match.  I'm glad our pleas have been heard!  With new High Definition equipment coming down in price, I can't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema."
dvd,10 of 12,5.0,We need more honesty in America and Moore delivers!,"Without rehashing all of the details concerning the many stellar episodes on this 4 DVD set, let me say this.  Michael Moore is truly a caring American patriot with a proper sense of justice, who has the balls to 'tell it like it is' in exposing some of the many wrongs and injustices in our society.  The content is often disturbing and often funny as heck.  Moore is a genius at using sarcasm and humor to rouse up concern regarding important, real life topics like poverty, homelessness, corporate crime, job loss, police abuse, deteriorating city schools, healthcare, etc. etc.  'The Awful Truth' is easily one of the best, most brutally honest and brilliant moments in American TV history!  Folks, do not miss these episodes, especially now that they're out on DVD.  Beg, borrow, steal, rent, or buy 'The Awful Truth' series.  It's THAT GOOD!!!"
dvd,23 of 28,5.0,ONE MORE BARGAIN for the serious collector....,"For whatever reason, we seem to be experiencing a release of some really fine films this season - there was a classic movie collection that included some new releases like the 30's version of ""David Copperfield"", there is another Gary Cooper collection that has the first DVD release of ""Sergeant York"" (that I am aware of), there is a new John Ford collection, a new Frank Capra collection, and now this - 7 movies from Preston Sturges.  Speaking strictly from a financial point of view - they are ALL great bargains, I believe buying these sets mean you are able to obtain these fine classic movies anywhere from 4 to 7 dollars a movie - a sales price that even my mother would appreciate - and she is the ultimate ""coupon clipper"".  But these movies are much, much more than just a ""good buy"" - these are all classic films from Hollywood's golden ""big studio years"" and they are directed by the industry's top story tellers, and they are enacted by Hollywood's leading actors and actresses.  These are the years that gave us terms like ""screwball comedies"" and ""zany"", when the sight of an actor wearing a tuxedo was a common sight - these are depression and post-depression years when the common folk could pay a quarter and escape into laughter for a couple hours while they watched how the ""other side"" lived.  Folks familiar with the movies of this era will already know what a great deal this is, and I think that most folks - who might not be familiar with the name of Preston Sturges - would still have seen most of these movies at one time or another.  For some reason unknown to me, Preston Sturges seemed to be very fond of using William Demarest in his movies, he appears in 6 out of these 7 - to those that the name of ""William Demarest"" doesn't ring a bell, you might remember him better as ""Uncle Charlie"" from the ""My Three Sons"" TV program.  William Demarest was a great character actor in his own right - appearing in countless movies throughout his life, he was always the gruff, harsh talking, sometimes sarcastic, but extremely likable sidekick.  I won't go on and on with endless product detail - I'm sure plenty of others will come along and do exactly that anyhow.  I'll just repeat again that these are ALL great and classic movies by themselves - for any person putting together a well balanced collection, these will make a fine addition - as will the others I mentioned.  At this point I have to admit I cheated a little bit - this ""set"" has not actually been released yet, so I have NOT purchased it in THIS form - BUT, I do own ALL these movies, having purchased them all seperately over the last couple years, and now I could kick myself, but who knew?  I own all these, and I have easily paid over $100.00 for them - now they are all available together for just a fraction of what I paid - oh well, live and learn.  Thanks again for reading what I had to say"
dvd,1 of 6,2.0,"Bland, predictable and cliche...","There are certainly some memorable scenes in this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me.  "
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,A Brilliant Madonna Video Collection,"When it comes to music videos, nobody can top Madonna. With over 40 videos to her credit, she is the queen of MTV. This 1990 video collection, titled the same as her 1990 greatest hits collection, may seem dated, but it's a great memento of Madonna at her peak."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Fun Characters/Lots of Action,"Midler and Long start out as adversaries in their NY acting class.  Finding out they shared a lover adds fuel to their feud, but his disappearance forces the mismatched pair to work together."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Larry David's Other Show,"""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is a very funny show from Larry David, the co-creator and executive producer of ""Seinfeld"", as well as the person behind the character George.  In this case, Larry himself is the central character, with the two main supporting characters Jeff Garlin (as Jeff Greene, Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines (as Cheryl David, Larry's wife).  There are certainly similarities between ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  Jerry Seinfeld played himself in the first series, while Larry David plays himself in this series.  Also, both shows tend to be about the minutia of life, and that is where they get their humor.  "
dvd,0 of 9,5.0,Haggis knows America!,"First saw this movie before Oscars were awarded, thought it was well written and acted.  Have seen it several times before buying the DVD and the impact of the story line and the underlying threads of ongoing prejudice in 21st century America become smore and more glaring and disturbing.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Prevention,"This is such a fun workout. At first I didn't like it because the format is different that many other workouts I have, but after doing it a few times it's become one of my favorite programs to use on days when I have more time. What's nice about it, too, is you can only do 4 of the circuits if you don't have time for the full program. There's a lot of energy in the ladies leading it and there are variations for those who can't do high impact, straight leg pushups or don't want to do all of the circuits, for example. If you are a moderate level exerciser, this is a good program. It's not intense, but makes you feel you worked out when you're done."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,a great workout,I tried this the day I got it and I love it. When you do pick your spot pilates you can do all the workout the abs butt and thigs or pick one or two and be done with the whole thing in a half an hour. Don't be fooled by it only being 10 minutes for each body part because you really get a great workout and it's not boring either. It's great for if you've got a lot of time or just 10 minutes. I recommend this.

dvd,4 of 6,4.0,Not the Best Season,"Actually, contrary to what other posters are saying, I think this is the weakest season, and I can see why they gave it a rest after this.  There is less ""zing"", less creativity, less point and bite than there had been in the first three seasons.  I find Season 3 the most startling overall."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Excellent DVD for every photographers,This DVD explains in details about what it takes on being a National Geographic photographer.

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"Better than Ken Burns, in some ways...","I was fortunate enough to see this on TV when it was broadcast in 1960 and after all these years I can still recall phrases from it. It was, apparently, the last thing Cooper did, and he does a wonderful job. I believe his voice actually breaks in sincere sorrow when he is reciting the famous speech by Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce, toward the end. His empathy and knowledge of the West (he was from Montana) are everywhere apparent. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,GREAT Show!,"I'm not a HUGE opera fan...bought this for Kristin Chenoweth...WOW...loved her performance...but everyone was spot on in this show.  I really enjoyed it, and have a different take on Opera from watching that.  Good stuff"
dvd,,4.0,Still wonderful,"While those who did NOT read book 4 might be puzzled, the film still holds great magic for the rest of us.  The telling of the tale, complex and dark, is handled well.  The special effects were excellent, the character growth wonderful and true.  How this will play out in future editions and movies is part of the magic of this series"

dvd,,4.0,Fun for Everyone,"This movie is pure fun.  My whole family loved it.  It's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it's amatuer hour, but its fun to watch.  We made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing.  Watch it and enjoy"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Down Syndrome:First 18 Months--very well done,"This video on DS and the experts and families who contributed were very helpful.  I read 3 books on the topic over the first month after the birth of my son, but I found this video to be the most helpful--would highly recommend to any family now facing this life-changing event"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,As good as any war film ever made,"This is truly a soldier's film, capturing in a microcosm of film everything which is horrible about war, from the disdain of the field grade officers whose lives aren't in danger, to the horrific decisions and life that the soldiers endured. A prior reviewer explained the inability to capture the reality of the bridge scene, especially given the budget of this film. It certainly caputures everything else about being a soldier and this insane expenditure of men's lives for no reasonable purpose. "

dvd,6 of 6,4.0,Not a Hoosiers Imitator,"We sure do make a lot of sports movies in the US, and this is one of the better ones, not as good as Hoosiers, but then again who could touch Gene Hackman in his prime, right?  What I like about this one is the somewhat stiff performances by Shaq and Anfernee Hardaway, which add ""something"" of reality to the film.  Really.  The other good thing is Nick Nolte.  He played his part to the hilt.  He sold his soul to the devil (he cheated), but then he redeemed himself.  The scene with him teaching the kids at the playground the fundamentals is a classy and classic ending.  Excellent movie. It's not as emotionally exhilerating as Hoosiers, but that's another story, right"

dvd,15 of 21,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout!!!,"Finally Ana is back with a whole new Pilates workout! She definitely knows how to pack a wallop in just 30 minutes! In addition, she included the Swan, one of my absolute favorite Pilates moves. I just wish the move could have been a little longer, though. This DVD is great for anyone generally new to Pilates. The one thing I was worried about though was the long table on which she worked out too. The setting itself was beautiful on a beach, but Ana was working on top of a table, and at times I was worried that something was going to happen to her. Luckily, nothing did. This workout worked out everything to me-the core, the legs, even the arms. I so can't wait to get her other new DVDs, coming out next month on Oct.4."
dvd,3 of 18,1.0,"A very, very, very silly movie","Having liked ""Sixth Sense"" very much, I was hoping to see another good movie from the same director. Sadly, this was not the case. I like science fiction, I like movies about the supernatural, I like mysteries, and I love comic books. I also appreciate thoughtful and thought-provoking explorations of racial issues. This movie had a lot of potential but instead just made a silly muddle out of everything. "
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,The Day of the Jackal,"I understand why this film recieved raves on release, but sadly it just doesn't measure up today. Having said that, I would rather watch this film ten times in a row. If you haven't seen this film then I advise you to see it as soon as possible"
dvd,,5.0, GRIPPING,"     ""The General's Daughter"" by Nelson DeMille is the greatest novel ever written! It includes mystery, murder, lies, corruption, and above all what I believe every book should have, a great ending. This novel takes place in the military base of Georgia, where detective Paul Brenner and rape specialist Cynthia Sunhill take on the very top secret murder case of Ann Cambell, daughter of legendary General ""Fighting Joe"" Cambell. At first detectives believed it to be another rape incident, but through further investigation they discovered that her death was not caused by rape. In fact both detective Brenner and Miss. Sunhill uncovered the true cause of Ann Campbells death by following the trails of military corruption caused by the victims shocking secret life. I believe that the plot of the story was so well detailed and capturing that, I found myself having it difficult to put the book down. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone searching for a novel full of suspense."

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The Adventure Gets Better.,"My liittle brother has played with Hot Wheels since he was of younger age. It's no shock because I played with them too, and that he's a boy, and, yes, I'm a girl, I needed something besides Barbie dolls. I was gettin' too old to play with dolls, then my little bro got the first Hot Wheels movie and we watched it a good trillion times, but it grew on me (After a year). We watched Ignition on Cartoon Network followed by The Speed of Silence a bit after, and I liked it, I really did. The action is great although on the verge of rough, it's nothing they haven't seen on Power Rangers. The CGI animation is a little on the cartoony side (for the fact that it IS a cartoon)!"

dvd,4 of 10,5.0,I just love Brit,"I used to love Britney because I aspired to be like her.  Now, I love her because her ""chaotic"" life make me feel better about my own.  I'll admit, she and her husband look like they belong in a trailor park of the slums of Beverly Hills, not Malibu, but this show makes you want to see more and more.  "
dvd,,4.0,A return to form for Wes Craven,"The last few times we've seen the words ""directed by Wes Craven"" on anything, it hasn't really been anything to write home about.  From the Scream trilogy to the debacle that was Cursed, it seemed like Craven had lost his edge.  The man who brought us terrifying, exploitation films like Last House on the Left and the Hills Have Eyes, along with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street, may not go for the throat like he used to, but Red Eye is as close a return to form for the director that we'll get for a while.  Hottie Rachel McAdams stars as a hotel manager catching the red eye flight back home, and soon enough she turns the tables on the psychopath (Cillian Murphy, more menacing and eerie looking than in Batman Begins if you can believe that) looking to assassinate her father (Brian Cox).  There's really nothing we haven't seen before in Red Eye, but under Craven's guiding hand the tension and suspense are superbly crafted.  McAdams and Murphy are quite good as well, and the film is short but sweet, clocking in at under an hour and a half.  All in all, there may well be hope yet for Craven's future films, and anyone looking for some great suspense should definitely check this out"
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,De Niro's 2nd movie,"This is a great film, made by Brian De Palma with a very young De Niro. He plays a really interesting role that shows how talented this actor was already in 1968. I recommend it for all De Niro's fans"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,War Photographer a Must for Photojournalists,"The film ""War Photographer"" is probably the best documentary I've seen profiling a photographer. Often these type of films give a cursory look at the photographer's life, maybe mention his/her philosophy and don't touch on his/her techniques at all. While unfortunately it doesn't go into any depth of how Jim Nachtwey grew up, his influences or training, it does explore his thoughts on being a war photographer and goes so far as to attach a mini camera to him as he shoots in various locations. This gives the viewer, and would be war photographer, an intimate look on how Nachtwey shoots his various subjects. From camera technique to positioning to interacting with his subjects, we see how he performs his job. It would be a good film for an aspiring photojournalist to watch"

dvd,6 of 7,5.0,"""Try this for a deep, dark secret...""","Yes, I was a kid growing up in the '80s and one of my favorite shows was the charming Remington Steele, which I actually preferred to Moonlighting. Pierce Brosnan was so cool and debonair and so dang British that I wanted to be like him. The fact that he was a con-man and had a mysterious past added to the mystique. And Lord, I had such a crush on Laura Holt, who was beautiful, clever, earnest, athletic and kinda prudish (turns out, our little Miss Prim & Proper had a few urges she firmly kept in check). Anyways, I'm a sucker for freckles. One of the best things about Season One was the ultra-cool theme song by the great Henry Mancini. The music exuded sheer class and sexiness and seemed to promise champagne and skullduggery. Another cool thing was the intro voice-over of Stephanie Zimbalist: ""Try this for a deep, dark secret. The great detective Remington Steele? He doesn't exist. I invented him. Follow..."" And so, we do."
dvd,2 of 5,2.0,disappointing movie ... the game is much better,"After playing Doom 3 (the PC video game), I had high hopes for this movie. Oh well. The movie was disappointing. Were their monsters? Yup. Blood and guts? Yup. Swearing? Yup. Guns and special effects? Yup. But after playing the PC video game, the movie lacked a lot on storyline. And it didn't make me jump as much as the game. The movie is dark, but that's okay, since it was patterned after the video game, which is also dark (although the game was much more ""playable""...with darkness...than the movie was ""watchable""). The game was scarier too. This says a lot about the game creators (very well done), and the movie directors (poor effort). I'm not sure why Hollywood couldn't hack it. It might be okay as a rental (especially if you haven't played the game), but don't buy it. Honestly, the movie turned-out to be just another alien movie.  However, the game tells a very different story.."

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Rattle, Hum & Chill Out","I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now.  Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie.  Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the ""holy lands"" of rock.  If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it.  Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland.  Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written.  By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career.  Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage.  Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride.  It's only rock'n'roll"
dvd,23 of 26,5.0,A Look At Absolute Truths And Objectivity,"One of the major problems I encounter with people who have viewed this cinematic masterpiece by Kurosawa is that the film is pretentious and boring. And more importantly, that the truth is readily available to the viewer if he or she just watches the film. However, that is the point of the film. What is the truth! We the viewer have the foreknowledge of the crime and the criminal being charged. ""Rashomon"" has always been one of my favorite films by Akira Kurosawa, although I do not place it in the top five of his greatest. "

dvd,3 of 9,5.0,Great Season,"This is one of my favorite seasons.  I loved Drew fuller and the charachter of Chris.  I have no idea why fans need to divide the seasons.  They are all great and need to be looked at as a whole.  Despite a few continuity problems, this season brought something fresh and new to Charmed.  What a great twist;  Chris comes back from the future to save Wyatt and the Charmed ones from a deadly fate.  From the end of season five, I had a suspision that Chris may be Pipers son, I thought, however that he may have been Wyatt at first.  But I rooted for him, despite his scheming at times.  Maybe in the future, writers need to review past episodes of the show they are writing for to avoid messing up details.  You see these these little flaws in so many shows, especially when dealing with time travel. "

Before we get there, however, we are in the midst of one of the most sophisticated comedies of style ever filmed, and we have witnessed Rex Harrison as De Carter give a titanic performance of plump ego, ridiculous self-righteousness and effortless comedy skill."

dvd,,4.0,"next to yoko, this was the craziest person ever living in the dakota","roman polanski firmly established himself among american audiences when he took ira levins fine potboiler into a different stratum. of course the movie has taken on an eerily prescient nature what with the events of polanskis life shortly afterwards (and id love to see it with its bookmark, the 1971 ""macbeth"" -- sadly not on dvd). but this was the best (maybe the ONLY good) performance mia farrow ever gave, and theres a ton of great supporting work, most notably by ruth gordon who turned this oscar winning role into a late career surge. thankfully censorious rules restrained what a few years later might well have given way to excesses. this movie captures 1968 new york city in a manner few others do."

There are people out there who would deter you from buying ""heart warming"" videos like these, just because they are searching for a crusade."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Brando as Presley via Tenessee Williams,"This is the film version of Tenessee Williams' Stage success ""Orpheus Descending"" (which would have been a confusing title for movie audiences). I have heard that Williams wrote this part with Elvis Presley in mind but Tom Parker wouldn't let the King of Rock'n Roll play it, and that's a shame. He probably would have been very good, but let's face it, he was no Brando. Brando is at his best as a young drifter/hustler with a past in New Orleans. He wanders into a small Southern town looking for work and finds Anna Magnani as a barren weary woman who has been bartered in marraige to a Tyrannical evil husband (Victor Jory). He encounters Joanne Woodward, a previous ""acquaintance"", as a dissipated spoiled Southern Bell who still lusts after him, and the plot continues to thicken. It seems  that Woodward's brother had an affair with Magnani sometime earlier and refused to marry her, causing her to have an abortion. Nature takes its course and the Brando character and the Magnani character begin an affair. I don't want to give away any more of the plot except to say that it's typical Tennessee Williams at his best which is to say ""It's excellent"". The Players, especially the stars Brando, Magnani and Woodward have never been better in their respective estimable careers. Look for Maureen Stapleton in a small but interesting supporting part. I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for years. I'm looking forward to it. Highly recommended."

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Shagedelic,"The Austin Powers movies are uniquely highbrow lowbrow comedy. They are spoofs of all the early James Bond films - Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice. If you have not seen these Bond films I suggest you watch them first - they are great action/spy films in their own right - and then watch Austin Powers; it will be that much funnier. But Austin Powers offers so much on its own beyond the Bond films. It's also a spoof on the sixties, the English and the Americans. There are the relationships between Dr. Evil, his staff, and his son. Dr. Evil himself is an invention of comedic genius, and he is, for me, the best thing about the Austin Powers movies. And lest you younger viewers think that the depiction of the hip sixties is an invented or exaggerated part of the crazy comedy, I can tell you that it is more ""right on"" than you may realize. Boy have times changed"

And why did not she simply unleash a Godzila on that bad guy? Then she faints and falls in love with a guy who has as much appeal as my supersonic toothbrush. And that's Cate Blanchett for you guys. Rejoice already. Then they shave their heads - a masterful plan to blend with Italian peasantry crowds. Great. Now what do you do when your shaving heads plan thing does not work? Jump on a helicopter and end the movie. I don't know... Sounds kind of stupid. Is it me or the movie"
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Excellent,"For the few reviewers that seem disappointed and perplexed by this movie and the ""unresolved"" ending, all I can say is ""I felt the same way when I first saw this masterpiece"".

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"Oh, the things this kid does...","Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another ""sick"" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones)."

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Big Trouble = Big Laughs,"'Big Trouble' has a lot of big things going for it...big laughs, big plot, big cast...and because of all this it loses a peg or two...for there's just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself...you get somewhat lost in the jumble.  The film stars Tim Allen in the central role, if you could call it that, as a journalist who gets himself and his son (Foster) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals (Sizemore & Knocksville) a hitman (Farina) a wealthy jerk-off of a man (Tucci), the mans wife (Russo) her daughter (Zooey) a homeless man that resembles Jesus (Lee in a histerical role) some mobsters, dimwitt cops (Garofalo & Warburton), FBI agents with attitude (Heavy-D & Epps) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva.  See all that and I haven't even got to the plot, but it's one of those things you'd have to see to really understand.  Lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly.  Does that sum it up?  It's funny, real funny, but it's also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace, keeping you watching closly to understand all that's going on.  It'll mae sense in the end though, I promise"

When I saw it straight, it was a little less amazing, but still pretty cool.  The film quality could be better, there could be a greater variety of shots, but hey, its a Primus concert, not a Hollywood flick.  The music still rocks.  If you plan on sitting down and watching this like you would a normal movie, you will likely be disapointed or just confused.

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Dark and Brilliant. ,"In my mind, this is Allen's blackest film.  He plunges the depth of the human existence and finds that there is little redeeming about our lives.  Judaic figures like Rabbi Ben and the family father are set up as straw men who argue that God sees everything and that there is a moral center to the universe.  The character of Judah, and his actions in the movie, suggest that they were wrong.  Their views are also refuted during the Passover seder scene, and later when the philosopher who is so admired commits suicide after writing the simple phrase, ""I've gone out the window."" "

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Old school ER!,"Beautifuly composed film - Kurosawa's 1968 film is right up there with 'Rashomon' on my list of favorites. It is a very interesting and at times curious film - threaded together in a way that the western viewer is not used to - but can adapt to. Toshiro Mifune is a very subtle and interesting character actor -and maybe gives his best performance here as Red Beard. This movie at times has an almost Ozu feel about it - a tender embracing of characters in a downward spiral of events - that evokes the Ozu style (not necesarrily in a direct way). This is unmistakeably Kurosawa, however, and is the equal, if not greater than his own samurai classics"
dvd,5 of 25,1.0,Good for a frisbee,"Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film ""Graffiti Bridge."" "

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,"""Fighting for Care""","""John Q"" is good for some thought-provoking ideas and questions concerning the ever-growing problems with our nation's health care policies, as well as some hard-hitting performances from its arsenal of talented actors.

dvd,,5.0,Wonderfully underplayed and life affirming,"We've had this movie for the last month, always putting off watching it for one reason or another. It is a very understated movie, with much of the action never commented on directly in the movie, but left up for the viewer to figure out. The plot is simple: Finbar McBride is a dwarf who loses his job when his best friend and boss suddenly dies, leaving him with a train depot in his will. Moving out to the small town where the depot is, all he wants to do is be left alone, but a combination of the Joe, the local Cuban hot dog vendor, and Olivia, a frazzled young mother who is grieving for the loss of her son, forces him to confront his new community, just as they are forced to confront him. Much of the humor comes from Joe, who forces himself into Fin's life, as well as the attempts by Olivia to try to make up for her first impression on Fin."

dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Semiotic Analysis of Rushmore,"""Rushmore"" serves as an interesting reference for semiotic analysis because its director, Wes Anderson, is a unique auteur.  He understands paradigmatic choices and commands them with a satirical tone characteristic in his films.  When performing this semiotic analysis, it helps to keep in mind the film's target audience as a point of reference.  This film is probably intended for an American audience of almost all ages however I think younger audiences, who have recently been through high school, could relate to the film in particular.  Even further, this movie could be considered only for the growing cult of loyal Wes Anderson fans who follow his distinctive brand of film.  For practical purposes of this essay, we will only examine the introductory scene from the movie paradigmatically and then look at some of its oppositions."

dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Ultra fantastic.,"This movie blew me away.  It stripped away the sexual hysteria of our times, and went straight to the essence of human life.  The bad guy of the movie arranges for a pretty college girl to be coerced into working in Seoul's red light district as a prostitute.  At first it horrifies her, but over time and through a series of dramatic incidents, the college girl grows accustomed to her sex work, and also finds herself being drawn to the bad guy who put her there.  The college girl's initial resistance to sex-for-pay eventually fades altogether, and becomes the catalyst for the relationship that she and the bad guy eventually share with each other by the end of the movie."

The rest of the population lived in constant fear and as Mifune's character rested himself in an inn and listening to the ins and outs of the town, he decided that for the best interest of the town, it's best to eliminate the warring factions so that people would be able to move on with their lives.  Being a samurai, his skill was very much sought after and he would try to outwit and outplayed those two parties just like in a Dutch auction.  It's black comedy at its best.  Watching it with my Japanese friends, they commented that the language spoken was very traditional and they even needed to resort to English subtitle to understand the movie.  Whilst the movie wasn't as fast-paced as modern rendition, it's still an entertaining movie to watch.  It's even more intriguing to see how much movie making has progressed over the years.  As movie enthusiasts would have learnt long time ago, this movie inspired or was inspired by the Spaghetti Western.  The mood of the movie, the soundtrack, the duels in high noon were always eminent.  Mifune was charismatic in his gaiety, his pose and he never betrayed his well-intentioned to the town till the very end, to which the population was warmth to his goodwill and decided to reciprocate the goodwill to him.  The digital technology enables the audience to enjoy the movie as it originally intended and the setup even allowed us to set the Dolby 2.0 mono version or the Dolby 5.1 version.  It does make a difference to the enjoyment of the movie.  Watching it made me appreciate even more the brilliance of Akira Kurosawa, of his ability to observe and display human's behaviour at their best and worst.  Commendable watching"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Bilko is brilliant,"Arguably the funniest sitcom ever to air on television. The creation of Nat Hiken, and starring the incomparable Phil Silvers and a cast of some of the greatest names in showbiz, this series is 50 years old. The episode where a chimpanzee is enlisted into the US Army is the funniest piece of television I have ever seen."
dvd,17 of 17,4.0,Band? Awkward?  You must be kidding me...,"A lot of the reviews I have read on here criticse Denise's use of the resistance band in this DVD.  I'll have to say that when I ordered this DVD, I actually wanted the free band more than the DVD itself! *shhhh!  Amazon doesn't ship exercise equipment to New Zealand, and hey, I got a DVD that used it too!*"
dvd,16 of 16,5.0,Fabulous structured workout!,"Over the years I have done my share of different workout videos, David's stands out from the pack as one of the best!"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,a masterpiece,great story and great acting. The characters are well formed and the actors are great. You will probably see it back to back..it is that goo
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,"The BEST legs, stomach, butt workout EVER!!",Recommend: START WITH THE BEGINNER!
dvd,3 of 6,2.0,NOT for Cardio workout....,"I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an ""indoor walk"" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout"
dvd,,4.0,A WWII Movie That's not About War,"Powell and Pressburger seldom disappoint, and this interesting tale weaving together a strange little mystery, a stranger in a strange land, the English homefront during World War II, and the blessings sought at Canterbury is one of the best stories they tell. "
dvd,2 of 6,5.0,Hidden Treasure,"I love buying movies that no one had heard of, just by reading the box. This one was a true find. Very sweet hidden love story and an all around wonderful movie"
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,Good if you like the rest of the series.,"Ignore all those Harry Potter nerds who say that it wasn't like the book, I mean who cares if it wasn't exactly the same as the book the film still turned out to be good and is a great follow up in the series. The missing scene involved that house elf from the book but it is not important, its great seeing all the characters grow up onscreen as they grow older the films become more serious but are still fun to watch. This film concentrates more on the Tri-wizard Tournement as Harry tries to prove that hes the most qualified and experienced wizard even though the senior wizards are giving him a hard time, you also get to see harry, Ron and Harmione prepare for the ballroom dance so there is alot of humor in it as well as some dark scenes when Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennes finaly makes an appearence (in person and not as something else) and has a confrontation with Harry Potter. Overall I would say that this film was great but not my favorite I still prefer Prisoner of Azkaban"
dvd,0 of 10,1.0,Put me Straight to Sleep.....,"Unless you enjoy lots of meaningless violence, this movie is a total bore.  Three guys and a pregnant Courtney Love rob a bank, and escape to a western town.  There is a lot of shooting and a lot of people die.  And that is pretty much the depth of the plotline.  A few funny lines in there, but definately not enough to be considered a comedy.  You know it's a bad movie when an hour's gone by and you're still waiting for the point.  Don't waste your money on this one"
dvd,,5.0,Great gay movie staple,"Love, love, love this movie!  First of all, JP Pitoc is gorgeous!!  Asidefrom that, its a greate romantic comedy with all the fixings of what makes me proud to be a gay man.  Definitely worth the purchase price"
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,Star Actors at Their Peak Inhabiting Tennessee Williams at His Most Flamboyant in a Rundown Mexican Resort,"Flamboyantly flawed characters are Tennessee Williams' oeuvre, and I doubt if any of his plays has more of them wallowing in their debilitated states of psychological disrepair than ""The Night of the Iguana"". This richly acted 1964 adaptation directed by the estimable John Huston has its share of excesses, veering wildly from melodrama to black comedy, but they are all for the sake of illustrating Williams' broader themes of alienation and redemption while screenwriter Anthony Veiller stays true to the playwright's Baroque flourishes."
dvd,,4.0,Nice Extras,"The best part about this release for me is that it's widescreen and has a pretty nice commentary. Though I will say one thing about the commentary, it is entirely from the view of the directors. No actors take of a scene or anything, it's mostly the design of the sets, musical score, &etc. Having said that, it's nicely done for what it is."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful,"A brilliant movie.  Painstakingly made.  Wonderful humor, stunts, pathos and social commentary.  The tramp is an intrepid little bum as he stumbles from job to jail and jail to job.  He subverts and mocks authority and technology just by being an innocent clumsy fool.  A great companion piece to the other Chaplin masterpieces, The Gold Rush and City Lights"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Absoulutely Great,"This movie starring Barbara Striesand and Nick Nolte is a fantastic movie.  Although long, you never become bored.  You are drawn in from the moment it starts.  I think the story is beautiful and has beautiful scenery.  Anyone from the south knows why they live here.  It's a wonderful place.  Great movie of redemption for Nick Nolte's character and Striesand as his savior. "
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,"Visconti's ""Il Gattopardo"": Merchant and Ivory, eat your hearts out.","I've known and loved the Prince of Lampedusa's novel of Sicily during the Risorgimento since it appeared in English translation in 1960. I was dubious when I heard that Luchino Visconti was making a film, staring the American actor, Burt Lancaster, as the ageing aristocrat of the title, and I gave it a pass when was released to the theatres. It wasn't until the late 1970s that I caught up with the film, on television, in the truncated form of the original North American release, and I was bowled over. To have it now, in a lovingly presented DVD, in the full original version is a rare treat."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,A great Korean movie,"This is one of the best Korean movies to come along in a long time.  The spoken Korean is absolutely beautiful and the images are as well.  After you see this movie, you will want to lean Korean as well as you will realise how much subtlety there can be in just one or two words.  "
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,One town's hill is the government's mountain....,"Hugh Grant stars as the hapless surveyer who has the dubious fortune of determining if mountains truly are.  When he discovers that a town's prized landmark falls a bit short, he's coerced by a local lovely into re-measuring.  What he doesn't know is the whole town is going to build a mountain while he's otherwise occupied.  This is a laugh a minute film and definitely one to be bought and kept for a day when you need cheering. "
dvd,17 of 18,5.0,Beginning Callanetics,"In the mid 1980s, I did regular callanetics.  Now, 20 years later, I wanted to get back to exercising.  Unfortunately, I was not in shape enough to do the regular workout.  Beginning Callanetics was just the ticket."
dvd,12 of 26,5.0,Bewitched-speed it up fellas on releasing these seasons,"I was so glad that BEWITCHED is being released on DVD, yes I am buying them and season 4 is being purchased without question. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Gorgeous,"I've always loved documentaries - I feel this movie is essential to anyone else who does.  It's beautiful and sad and amazing all at once.  I rented it on a whim one night because I thought it sounded interesting.  Although I was expecting a more sociological look at the plight of the homeless, I cannot fault this movie for being what it is, because I was really awestruck by it. "
dvd,,5.0,and we liked it,Dana Carvey was one of the kings of snl and this just hightlights some of his performances from garth to grumpy old man to church lady Carvey is hystericaly funny thats why i gave it 5 star
dvd,,4.0,A rare treat,"Its so rare in this day and age to get a great book made into a very good film with great actors. Anne Rice was understandably happy with the performance of Tom Cruise as Lestat as he really eats up the screen when he's in any scene. Brad Pitt has his work cut out for him making a whiny character like Louis into a likeable sympathetic hero, but just about pulls it off. Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as their daughter, but the star of the show is probably (and surprisingly) Antonio Banderas who is superbly convincing in his part, hinting that he could have been a far more respected actor than he gets credit for these days. Admirable support is provided by Stephen Rea and a slightly underused Christian Slater in what is a wonderfully moody and dark tale. Excellently directed and only occasionally a little slow, Interview is a darn sight better than it has any right to be. An intelligent horror film, not for those who like no brainer vampire flicks of which there are many"
dvd,,5.0,Jim Gaffigan - Beyond the Pale,"One of the funniest DVD's out there, Hooottt Poooccckeett skit is hilarious"
dvd,,4.0,Lighthearted Entertainment,This film for me has always been a guaranteed laugh. The southern accents and snooty New York attitude superbly played are hilarious! Bette Midler and Lilly Tomlin now how can you come up with a better duo other than double it
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,M. Night's Masterpiece,A young boy has the uncanny ability to see and communicate with the dead....that's pretty intense.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanted to pee your pants the whole time.  M. Night Shymalan is one of today's best directors.  The performances by the actors are fantastic and believeable.  The movie has a plot that is totally awesome with an awesome ending.  This is certainly one of my top 10 movies of all time
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Not Bad...,"The 1968 version of ""The Producers"" has long been considered one of the funniest films ever made. Years after it's release, it was adapted into a musical for Broadway and (among others) taking on the lead roles were Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. When they're version became a success, a movie was made...Not a remake, but a movie version of the stage play. The same is being done right now with John Waters' ""Hairspray."""
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,absolutely nightmarish,"When her dad tells her, I was sure you knew all along, ...  oh my goodness, I tell you it will scare you to death.  Sheryl Lee's performance will absolutely break your heart.  This film will not let you go"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,EXCELLENT,I thought it was excellent.It is great for kids.All of the shows on the DVD are great
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,have you heard of the soldier who killed an innocent today?,"As a high ranking Marine rushes in to retrieve the American ambaserder to a country in the middle east after days of protesting and now violence, he remembers the flag, and hustles to retrieve it.... One of the best scenes I've ever seen with Samuel L Jackson. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,As Good As It Could Be Without the Man,I was lucky enough to have seen both Skid Row and Lizzy in their prime. The only thing that could have made this show better would have been Phil himself on vocals. A great reunion feel about the show.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Okay, so I really, really LIKED it ...","I read the book, and responded to the story in a manner that might be deemed ""unmanly"" by some.  I saw the movie, and the water-works began all over again.  There is much here, mostly things that are in gravely short supply.  A sense of purpose, and sense of there being a meaning that's too big to see.  And Hope."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,'B' at it's best....,"Clearly a 'B' movie, but a good 'B' movie. A few characters may have gone over the top at times, but Viggo came out shining. The bond that grew between Nick and Shu was heartwarming. I would have liked to see the relationship develop more, perhaps replacing the weak and thankfully brief love angle, but overall I thoroughly enjoy this movie. I believe any admirer of Viggo Mortensen's work should add this one to their collection."
dvd,,4.0,From Rags to Riches,"Based on the novel by E.L. Doctorow , "" Ragtime "" is a timeless classic that has been brought to film by "" The Deer Hunter "" director , Milos Foreman. Foreman along with editors , Stanley Warnow and Judith Blume tell this story with intellect and proficiency without excessive altering of the book. "" Ragtime"",  features a stellar ensemble cast such as Moses Gunn , Elizabeth Mcgovern , Brad Dourif , Mandy Patinkin , Mary Steenburgen , Jeff Daniels , and Kenneth McMillan. However , I must admit that it was Howard Rollins's solid and electrifying performance as Colehouse Walker Jr., that stole the entire film. Debbie Allen , in an Oscar worthy performance, was a superb contrast to Rollins's character. Moreover ,to give the film an historical merit , ""Ragtime"", also features the last cinematic performance by legendary performer, James Cagney and the last time that we would ever see Cagney and his legendary film co-star Pat O'Brian , share the same screen again. Whereas , ""Ragtime"" certainly has it's share of long winded scenes and meledramatic tones , it is the cast and directing that provide this film with unforgettable cinematic moments. Randy Newman provides the unforgettable score for the film. "" Ragtime"" will always have a spot in my dvd/vhs collection and I highly recommend it for a nice Sunday afternoon film."
dvd,1 of 12,1.0,What ... the ... hell?,"It's hard to believe I watched the same movie as everyone else here. This movie fails on every level. It isn't a good action movie, or a good silly movie, or a good comedy, or a good satire ... or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags, terrible dialogue, weak characters, vapid plot, and so on. There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll like it because you like Shaolin Soccer, Iron Chef, Rumble in the Bronx, Ong Bak, or almost any other far-superior show or movie to which it might be compared. God of Cookery is just painful, feeble, and empty"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Another pearl from Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming and David Silver","Having owned the videotape of this offering from Dr. Yang, I was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the DVD.   I was very satisfied with the information offered on the VHS tape, but having already owned the material, it didn't make sense to purchase a DVD unless there was something added to the material.  "
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,The Hardcore Legend Shows Us Why He's Hardcore,I have always been a fan of mick foley so when i bought this dvd i had high expectations and they were not only met they were blown out of the water.Below is a rundown of the matches:
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Love the music and the storyline.,"I've been a fan of this version of the movie for years. I love the theme music, and the storyline. George Pappard is wonderful also. Definitely dated, a lot of sexist stuff, pre women's lib"
dvd,,5.0,Very Entertaining.,"""The Sentinel"" isn't a movie I entirely expected to like, although I've wanted to see it since it was in theatres. Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called ""Firewall."" Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to ""Firewall"" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is ""In the Line of Fire."" It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself ""that sounds/looks familiar."" I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time. Due to its flaws, with only the fact that I enjoyed it to support my case, I should give it 4 stars...But I think that it's worthy enough of 5."
dvd,23 of 29,4.0,Shadows,"Released originally in 1957, newly restored this year, Louis Malle's (""Pretty Baby"") gorgeous ""Elevator to the Gallows"" (""Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud"") is ultimately more flash than substance: many scenes were filmed with natural light (shades of Dogma95?) and Jeanne Moreau's penultimate scene walking down the Champs Elysees light only from the glare of the shop windows that she passes is stunning in its simple, shadowy beauty. Paris, in many ways has never looked more beautiful or more sinister."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Kisses With Dreams In Them....,"Lana Turner and John Garfield hunger for something more in Tay Garnett's glossy soap opera noir, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" Based on James M. Cain's lusty potboiler, Turner is fantastic as the manipulative yet vulnerable Cora Smith and Garfield excellent as the drifter who can't get Cora or her dreams out of his blood. Turner is like a white creme, icy cold on the surface but burning hot and deep with desire underneath. "
dvd,,5.0,The Laurie Berkner Band,My son is 14 months and absolutley loves to watch and dance to this video.  I highly recommend it
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,A very nice presentation,"After performing in the pit for a production of this in my hometown, I wanted to see the original Broadway cast doing this musical.  The set is fantastic!  What a joy to watch!  For the sharp humor side of this show, I'd strongly suggest this DVD recording, but for a more musical expeirience I would buy the soundtrack of the original BW cast.  The DVD has a few lagging tempos, which is very annoying after listerning to the snappy soundtrack.  Also there are 2 notes that don't quite make it up there on the DVD.  Overall, I would highly recomend this DVD recording; I just love Little Red Riding Hood's humor.  The CD is worth a listen too.  ""And home before dark!"""
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,To Catch a Thief,"Was impressed with the prompt processing of my order and in its fast delivery.  I have watched the movie twice.  I really like most of Cary Grant's movies, and this one's no exception.  The package was in great condition.  I will likely use Amazon again"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"""I saw Blue, and he was glorious!""","I am a HUGE Will Ferrell fan.  I am also a huge Vince Vaughn fan, so when you get them together with a script allowing them to take over and expose their comedic genius then I am all for it.  Sure, Luke Wilson is the star but put him on the screen with either of the aformentioned and he fades into the backdrop.  The film revolves around three friends, each of which are having women troubles.  You have Frank (Ferrell) who has just got hitched but his marriage is already having trouble.  Then theres Mitch (Wilson) who just caught his girlfriend (Julitte Lewis) having some S&M fun with a few people in their house.  And finally we have Beanie (Vaughn) who is successful and married to a beautiful woman (Leah Remini) and has two children but is missing the fun he once had with booze and young women.  So, in an effort to bring themselves up from the slump they are in they decide to throw a large party at Mitch's new house near the local college campus.  The party is a success and they are the new kings of the town.  (The whole 'Frank the Tank' scene is the greatest scene in the film)  There's one problem, and his name is 'Dean' Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Pivon in a hilarious role).  Gordon has history with the three party animals and is determined to have them evicted.  So, in an effort to save their home they start a fraturnity which turns into the base for one hilarious film.  Cameos from the likes of Snoop Dogg and Sean Williams Scott as well as the always funny Andy Dick give this film even more cred.  Throw in the spark of a new love for Mitch with the beautiful Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) and her jealous and perverted boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) and throw in Elisha Cuthburt for good messure and you have a non-stop laugh fest that will never get old"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,TERRIFIC  ENTERTAINMENT -- GREAT VOICE WORK BY SACHA BARON COHEN,"The best DVD thing about MADAGASCAR besides the hip and funny zoo guys going  wild, the witty story, great character design, ultra-sharp wonderfully hued transfer and the cool commentary by the scene-stealing penguins is the absolutely brilliant voice work by Sacha Baron Cohen. Too bad he's not featured on the extras.  "
dvd,2 of 11,1.0, If I could I would rate it minus 1 star,"I was trying to watch this film to the end, but I almost could not do it. The biggest problem with this film that there is no original story line, absolutely ""0"" chemistry between Brad and Angelina, acting talent also equals to zero.  Cheap all the way through, don`t waste your time. It`s a pitty Brangelina got paid for making this film... I should have got paid for watching it. Don`t fall for old Hollywood tricks. Make up your own mind... and rent another movie"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Loves Long Journey,"Very good story,need to see or read all three in series Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise, and Loves Long Journey in that order to really get the story line and the feel of what is going on. Very good story about those times and what people had to deal with and a good love story."
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,A  must for Monk fans ,"If you love Monk's recordings you can't afford not to own this. Here is Monk performing many of his classics in a variety of settings in addition to a very well edited documentary. The non-performance clips do much to shed light on Monk's personality and includes interviews with Charlie Rouse and T. Monk Jr. I thought the sections with his son , while brief, were very touching and revealing of the private struggles that Monk went through. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Reminds you of a Duke Western,"This reminded me of something that John Wayne might have done. Here Tom Selleck does a fine job playing a drifter that makes a promise a dying friend to defend his wife and her land. When he arrives he finds the ranch to be neglected and everyone hasn't seen the owner in a year. Perhaps foolsih but he enlists the aid of two of his friends and a former ranch hand, played by Wilford Brimley, and they make a go of putting the ranch back in shape after a year of neglect. Mark Harmon plays the concerned man that is wooing the widow, but seems to have ulterior motives.  This has good acting, sets, scenery, and music. Well worth owning."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,this is an amazing movie,"This has to be one of my favorite gay-themed movies that I've recently bought. I was glad to have bought this because I had two bad movies in the mix with this one for my last purchase. It was a sigh of relief. The character that Chad Allen plays, Donald Strachey, is done wonderfully. He has this tough side that he uses for work as a P.I. dectective, but then when he comes home to Timothy, his partner, and becomes this sweet, caring, thoughtful, loving man that wants to just separate his work from home life. "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,What a marriage!,"What can I say , Danny De Vito and Bette Midler are great!  Very funny movie.  Laughed all the way through...  "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,One of Welles' richest and most underrated fables,"We will probably never know exactly what Orson Welles envisioned Mr. Arkadin to be, but even in its present state, it remains a commandable achievement and one of his most underrated films. His storytelling mastery is evident throughout, both in the sound and images. As in Citizen Kane, the main character's life is gradually explored, but this time it's the subject of the inquiry who started it himself; this brings the film in the territory of initiations and psychoanalysis. Seemingly to uncover his own past, Arkadin sends low-profile hood Guy Van Stratten in a complex initiatic quest, one in which the initiated is mostly lured by money and luxury. Like Kane, Arkadin takes shape mainly via other people's testimonies, and he undergoes his own type of initiation: for the very first time, he is stripped of the masks and disguises he always relied on, and he is scared at the perspective of his private self (his Jungian 'number 2' personality) being discovered by the only person he cares for. Fables are scattered throughout the film, and the movie itself is such a tale, Arkadin acting as its grand, imposing Ogre, a character possessing strange and far-reaching powers. His overbearing abilities are illustrated in various ways, notably through the film's rapidly changing settings (a device also used in The Trial). The work's depth can also be measured by this consideration: Mr. Arkadin's universe is a huge maze in which Arkadin himself is Minos, Dedalus and the Minotaur all at once. This dense, rich and dreamlike film has never really received its due"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"""No One Knows Who They Were Or What They Were Doing, But Their Legacy Remains""","A seering exploration of life behind the glitz and glamour of rock and roll? Not quite, but it is an amusing mock-u-mentry on a fictitious band named Spinal Tap and the trials and tribulations on the concert road for a group long past its glory days."
dvd,26 of 33,5.0,GREAT DVD!,"This is a terrific, user friendly DVD for all levels of fitness.  And I just heard about more great workouts from Joel Haprer just out called FIT PACK.  It's 9 short fat burning, muscle building, cardio-conditioning workouts all on one DVD.  Three hours of exercising, for all levels, all ages.  Sounds like the perfect companion to  YOU ON A DIET WORKOUT!  Definitely putting that on my must buy list.  [..."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Action Packed Thriller,I absolutely love the 24 series. The only show I have in my schedule to watch every week. And I enjoy going back to re-watch the previous seasons. 
dvd,,5.0,Very Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed behind-the-scenes and interviews with the actors, etc.  However, (with the exception of Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire) I thought that all of the ""great"" plays featured appeared very ""stagey"". I would like more DVD's like this that feature primarily interviews instead of highlights of the plays"
dvd,,4.0,Ice Age,"One rainy day, my friend and I decided to watch a movie, but couldn't figure out which one. She pointed out Ice Age and since she really wanted to see it, I gave it. It ended up being a very good, funny and entertaining movie.The plot of the movie is good, though it's not really for small kids, it's more for grown-ups. The movie is fun to watch, and you can watch it with whoever you want to. It's suitable for children."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Great Information on Driving,"This is a great DVD on high speed driving techniques. These techniques will not only help you on the racetrack, but can be applied to make you a safer driver on the street. I've read dozens of books about driving techniques but you can learn more faster watching this DVD than you can reading books. This is the next best thing to going to a driving school. My favorite part of the DVD is most of an entire race at Lime Rock has been filmed from the driver's perspective, and that is an incredibly helpful tool. I would have given it 5 stars, but it is beginning to show it's age. I think Skip Barber's School should do a scene-by-scene remake so I can give it 5 stars!    "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,This is second to none version.," A masterpiece was due to the original as well as the powerful combination of charismatic persona, Lana Turner and John Garfield, Impressive acting, fine directing. Lana Turner plays typically calculating femme fatale. However mysterious sensual unique. Postman as doom-ridden victim, John Garfield delivery catastrophe while the harvest of evil affairs causes inevitable retribution. This is a serious crime drama, but the other side a cynical justice drama"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,HILARRIOUS!!!!!,"This is a great movie! I could not stop laughing! It totally is enjoyable to everyone,and I can't wait to see the sequals! I hope they're as good as this debuet"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,PLEASE STOP THE CRYING ALREADY :- (.........,I really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc. I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length. The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film kids! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well. I think the remake is incredible.....is it better than the original? In some ways yes! in some ways no! Thats the way it goes! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone's movie collection! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-) 
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A work of extraordinary brilliance,"I adore this movie. A.J.'s performance is almost too incandescent to watch. She becomes the character in a way that entirely blows my mind. The beauty and reality she creates on the screen, the pathos, the pain and the sense the character extols that there is a raw flame of immortal life in the world and that, at least at the moment, it's on the screen reminds me of what Henry James wrote of Dorothea Brooke, the heroine of Middlemarch: 'We believe in her as in a woman we might providentially meet when we should find ourselves doubting of the immortality of the soul.'"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,John Carpenter gives us yet another fantastic horror film.,"Yes I happen to agree with the review below mine and have to say that this film is one of John Carpenter's best and is my favorite allong with The thing and Halloween. It has a very smart storyline and has a quiet unique and interesting idea about Quantum physics and satanic possesion, trust me it will make sense later in the film. When a group of graduate students and scientists discover an ancient canister containing an evil-looking liquid in an abandoned church all hell breaks loose as the liquid seems to come alive and turns some members of the group into zombies, but even worse it releases Satan. I remmember watching this film as a kid and being absolutely terrified by it especially at the scene where the chinese guy gets stuck in the small room or closet when he then sees the possessed female and starts panicking and tells the guys to get him out of there , soon her stomach starts to fill up and her face was very grotesque and disgusting it almost gave me nightmares seeing this part now and I just had to laugh at what used to be frightening still it is a very entertaining and enjoyable horror film. You'll also get to see a short cameo by Alice Cooper as a demonicly possessed bum who provides one of the best death scenes in the film when he kills one of the scientist, anyway I highly recommend this great and exciting film to all horror fans and two thumbs up!."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Watch this movie!,I loved this movie. The story focuses on a group of 4 friends who study in a catholic school and are troublemakers . they are in constant fight with the school nun (jodie foster)and plan on some mischiefe against her.
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Hilarious,"Two people made this moving hilarious:  Zaboo and Vince Vaughn.  Although I'm a huge Travolta fan, these two supporting characters kept me in stitches.  Cedric the Entertainer also added to the success of this movie."
dvd,14 of 14,5.0,FANTASTIC!!!,"This set is fantastic.  I just started using it two weeks ago and am already starting to notice a difference... not major, but a difference.  Believe me, this set is great for any age and any activity level... so if you are beginner, these are a great place to start.  I had been either walking at work during my lunch or doing the treadmill at home, which I find totally monotonous and BORING!!!  A friend told me about Leslie's videos and that she has been doing them for 8 years!!!!  I knew if she had stuck with them for 8 years, they must be great so I figured what the heck!  "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Seduced by an oven of witches?,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out and ten years later it's still just as funny. Basic plot: Ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he's ALONE on New Year's night. Anyone who's had a bad night/day on the job can relate to Ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations. From the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion, to a gangster's bratty kids, a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken Hollywood people who want to make Ted part of their hazardous (and very gross) bet. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that I will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever. If you love a good, dark comedy this is the movie for you"

Had he wished he could have taken a different road in life and become like his close friend, Bernard Lewis, a great scholar. Instead he made a certain sacrifice and devoted his life to the cause of helping the Jewish state come into being and survive."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,A bloody modern day siege,"Ethan Hawke leads a well rounded cast starring as booze and drug dependent yet ethical Detroit police Sergeant Roenick in the action thriller ""Assault on Precinct 13"".  Eight months after a bungled drug bust in which he was wounded and two partners were killed, he finds himself in decommissioned precinct 13.  He was assigned the regretable job of manning the nearly barren station on New Years Eve, with old police veteran Jasper played by an aging Brian Dennehy and precinct miniskirted secretary Iris Ferry played by the sexy Drea DeMatteo."
dvd,14 of 14,4.0,AMERICA'S GREATEST DIRECTOR!,"The John Ford collection is a set of vintage Ford films,without John Wayne while and I would NOT have included Mary of Scotland,and would have preferred either The Plough and the Stars,or The Fugitive (Henry Fonda)or the underrated Two Rode Together,this is still a very good film set.There is a separate Ford-Wayne collection,which I will review latter.The five films,in this collection are: The Lost Patrol;The Informer;Cheyenne Autumn:Mary of Scotland:Sergeant Rutledge: The following are my reviews of each individul film."

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,I love this workout,I love this workout for a number of reasons:
dvd,,5.0,All Dolled Up - a must have,"This is an awesome dvd. You will be glued to it and watch it over and over. I didn't notice the deterioration of the Dolls others comented on, which was nice. Who wants to watch their favorite band fall apart?"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Relax and Enjoy a Great Performance by Diana Ross,"I watched ""Lady Sings the Blues"" on DVD after several years of having not seen it.  My memory of the film was that ""Diana Ross was really good in that movie"". "
dvd,,5.0,The Searchers,"The Searchers is probably my favorite John Wayne movies. It has many levels of understanding ,from a simple western adventure to the soul searching and life changing events we all have."
dvd,13 of 13,5.0,A Mackerel Sky,"Meryl Streep gives a heartbreaking performance in this deeply affecting and brilliant film about a woman trapped forever in the past. Susan Traherne might appear on paper to be a selfish and unlikable woman, but Streep somehow manages to let the audience see her inner anguish and restlessness, and her quiet desperation at not being able to recapture the feeling of living life to its fullest; something she experienced during WWII as a Resistance fighter in France. It is one of the most exquisite performances ever captured on film."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Humbled...feeling small,"What an incredible journey.  This movie puts all other kayaking accomplishments to shame.  I would recommend first reading the book (Hell or High Water by Peter Heller) about this expedition to fill in the gaps the movie could not possibly fill.  Another great book to read for background on how remote and dangerous this canyon is...The Heart of the World by Ian Baker.  Amazing kayaking, brings a whole new meaning to the words ""big water"" boating.  Take a trip to Tibet and be humbled by the Tsangpo.."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"SNEEZES, SEX AND HAM AND CHEESE ON RYE","This is a deliriously silly little movie, but it's fun to watch.  Kim Basinger utilizes her breathtaking beauty to its fullest as she discovers the joys of becoming human, from sneezing to sex to ham and cheese on rye with mayo.  Basinger's comic timing carries the movie, and even the usually disposable Dan Aykroyd's performance is comic and he and Basinger have a good chemistry.  There are some delightful sequences, e.g., when Kim has to discover how to kiss, her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses, and when she has to have sex, she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all.  Jon Lovitz is around for comic relief as Aykroyd's bachelor brother, and it's all mindless nonsense; it's also quite entertaining.  Basinger is a blast"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,This is a Van Damme movie???,"Let's face it, Van Damme has dished out some rather campy movies in the past 7 or so years.  However, there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this movie, along with the recent ""Wake of Death.""  "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Dark and Thoughful Days,"Marc Singer is a bloke from England who moved to New York City, saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets, and became friends with them.  They in turn trusted him, accepted him as one of their own, and showed him their secret living quarters.  Deep underground in abandoned train tunnels, the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets.  Intelligent and resourceful, they had hooked up to free electricity and had working TV's and stoves."

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Full Spectrum of skiing from zero to hero,"The Fundamentals of cross country skiing is bundled with the movie high velocity biathlon.  The movie plays first, and WOW what a cool ride.  Elite skiers, zooped up with rifles.  Great scenery and sound tracks with lot of extras. Don't stop there.  "
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,A keeper,"This is a very cute movie about friendship that should be in everyones collection.  The story is great for the kids, but the adults in the family will love the ""in"" jokes that go over the head of the little ones. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Paranoid Computer Intrigue With A Winning Performance By Sandra Bullock,"I'm a sucker for Sandra Bullock, and she's the reason why this thriller of paranoid business intrigue works as well as it does. The story line is simple. Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer expert who tests software. She's a genius at what she does. One day she comes across a disc which gets her into something called The Gatekeepers. It shouldn't have done so, and before long she becomes the object of a hired killer, her best friend dies in a hospital and she's on the run with her identity stolen. She doesn't know what's going on, but in self defense she starts cracking computer codes and discovering secrets. By the end of the movie she has narrowly escaped death more than once, helped a bad guy take a dive off a catwalk, managed to break into a high security area and copy some incriminating computer files and then bring down a murderous and resourceful computer security corporation and its millionaire owner."
dvd,,5.0,Great film and an unforgettable acting performance,"Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) is on a downward slide as an ambulence-chasing alcoholic lawyer when his associate (Jack Warden) tries to slap him out of his stupor in order to remind him that he is throwing away an opportunity to get back on his feet. Galvin starts going through the motions of collecting information about a case that involves a young child-bearing woman who suffered brain damage as a result of being given the wrong anaesthesia. Some of his old fight comes back to him when he starts to realize the negligence involved, and before he has thought much about it, he starts on the path of what he takes to be doing the right thing. But doing the right thing can be a formidible undertaking. He had once lost a prestigious job and his wife had divorced him after he tried to do right thing. Now, as he struggles to clear out the cobwebs, before he realizes it, he has managed to alienate almost everyone, including his previously very trusting clients, and faces almost all by himself a power structure that is aware of and capable of subverting his every move."
dvd,,5.0,The best DVD I have in my collection,"There's little to say about this movie, since I assume that people interested in buying this item have already seen it already. But the amount and quality of extras that this DVD has is just breathtaking. To say the least, Disc 2 has the IMAX version of the film, which at the time of this writing is not documented here in Amazon. The IMAX version is, well :), a shorter version of the film (1h55' versus the 2h20' of the regular) in an aspect ratio of 1:66. So if you were unsure as to buy the Widescreen or FullScreen versions, I suggest buying the Wide, since you will get (sort of) a full screen version in the IMAX one present on Disc 2."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,This underrated film sure was pretty funny,"This comedy was released to shockingly bad reviews. But to me, This was easily Chris Farley's funniest movie. A clumsy ''Ninja'' named Haru [Chris Farley] offers help to a woman named Sally [Nicolette Sheridan] who shows up at his dojo looking for someone to help her prove that her boyfriend is involved in crime. This movie was funny. There was a lot of gags in this movie that was hillarious. Especially the scene where Farley is on stage dancing with a bunch of strippers. This movie is very underrated and it's a shame that this movie was slept on because of the negative things many critics said about this movie. This movie proves that Chris Farley was a very funny comedian who died too early. Hope the review helped."
dvd,8 of 8,4.0,The Book of Acts made interesting and understandable! ,"First, I agree with other reviewers here that the portrayal of Paul the Apostle by Anthony Hopkins is a standout performance worthy of an emmy nomination. Robert Foxworth's Peter is also interestingly done but our information is lacking about his ministry when he disappears after Chapter 7 in the book of Acts. Therefore the movie focuses on Paul's attempt to unite Jew,Greek and Roman in a trinity of new Christian faith and this film delivers on that concept, even though it is somewhat romanticized. Some very effective scenes remind you of ""Jesus of Nazareth"". One suprise is when Paul is being confronted by his ""thorn in the flesh"" while consulting with Barnabas and Mark, you hear a mysterious sound that is tough to catch but Mark inquires what it is to which Paul replies ""just an animal"". (Actually it is a devil). Also there is a great confrontation with the woman who throws her voice into statues and animals to ridicule Paul's ministry. When Paul tells her that she won't have the power to do that again it is effective enough to put a fear of the Lord into you! We get to see the journeys of Paul and Barnabas (you will notice a gradual decline in the richness of Barnabas shown in his clothing) , we meet Luke, Timothy, Silas, Mark and get a basic grip on what the spread of Christianity was all about in the ancient world. Nero's fay behavior will get on your nerves especially when he is engaged in conversations about Paul with his jailer. Paul's triumphant entry as a prisoner into Rome will remind you of Jesus and his entry into Jerusalem so much so that it can bring a tear to your eye. The original scene of Paul forgiving the Axeman when he is beheaded has been removed for some reason on this DVD. Well recommended to anyone who wants some insight into the early development of the Church and to understand persecution of the apostles!"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,How Can We Be Deaf To Music?,"The blas will say that this is one more film on the life and retirement of a good teacher. One more and nothing else. They would be slightly wrong. This film is a lot more interesting and profound than that. First of all it becomes personal and poignant when his own son is discovered to be 90% deaf at birth. For a musician and music teacher tbis is a tragic blow, even if Beethoven became deaf in his life. Then it shows that a good teacher is not supposed to caress the students in the smooth way of things, but he has to be both exacting and demanding on one side and on the other side helpful in the effort the students have to do to eventually come to the pleasure of becoming able to play beautiful music. And it takes a tremendous effort on the teacher's part to be that inspiring and ruthless guide who will teach rhythm and drumplaying to a black man who will die in Vietnam, sentiment and clarinet playing to the only daughter of a family who has no creative dimension, emotion and how to sing with her heart to a girl who would like to take her music teacher along with her to New York. But furthermore the film is also a vast trip from the sixties to the nineties, from Kennedy to - the unnamed - Clinton, with the Vietnam war at the back, Hair, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Nixon resigning, Ford falling when walking down from a plane, Reagan and his famous Hollywood smile, and of course the severe cuts in education in the mid-nineties that led to dropping all artistic activities from the curriculum of the school. And we could go on and on with levels of meaning that avoid mish-mash sentimentalism. And yet the end is kind of too much. How can we imagine the school, the principal and the whole community who have rejected the man at sixty without more ado than for an insignificant incident come together to unanimously present him with a farewell present that should have asked months of secret preparation ? And that present means that this Mr Holland has sacrificed all his personal and musical potential for the sake of teaching music to kids, including his composing and his musical inspiration. This leads to the saddest fact of all : education is based on a frustrating ddication from the teachers. A dedication that verges onto sacrifice, of one's own life and of one's family's life, and a frustration that stifles in the teacher what is his deepest and most insanely creative inspiration, which delivers him to retirement a hollow shell with an uncatchable ghost of a dead ambition. This film is thus very painful : as long as our school system will demand such sacrifices from its teachers it will lead to a deeply boring and frustrating education that will leave young people naked and unarmed in front of life when the real hardships of history come, and they always come back over and over again."
dvd,,5.0,KNOWLEDGE,Simply Fantastic!  Anyone with an open mind and a scientific inclination will love this.  Some of the subject matter is a bit adult so be mindful before showing this to your children. 
dvd,,5.0,Christopher Walken,"Of course, Christopher Walken is one of the all time best actors and Abel Ferrara is an outstanding cult director. Their co-operation is probably among the best ever happened to cinema. Although the story itself is nothing to cheer about, especially where ex-con Walken goes charity, the acting and photography is worth watching this movie over and over again. Great acting by Larry Fishburne as well."
dvd,,4.0,great season!,"I am so glad I bought this Survivor season! I needed something to watch as I lay in bed recovering from back surgery, and this was perfect!! It is definitely far better than the first as far as I'm concerned. The major players are much more interesting than the first- Colby, Tina, Jerri, Elizabeth, etc., plus they had to endure much more hardship than the first- fires, flooding, running out of food, Mike falling in the fire, etc. It's much more fun to watch Survivor's second go at it, as the challenges are harder, the players are smarter, and the Outback terrain is rougher than the beach in the first season. A great buy"
dvd,65 of 67,4.0,"""We better not go too far, we'll loose money"" is the bottom line in Hollywood. ",Intimacy isn't about titillation or tanned toned Hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays. Instead it's about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely physical relationship. Both are empty individuals and briefly find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings. Nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding.

My question to him is, how do you know--have you seen it?  Since it hasn't been released yet, that's highly unlikely."
dvd,,5.0,Please do an anniversary edition DVD!,"If you like emotional thrillers, you'll love this one!  The movie starts off showing a pregnant Claire Bartel (Annabella Sciorra) going to a new doctor for an examination.  Dr. Mott molests Claire during the exam, and a traumatized Claire makes the agonizing decision to file a complaint against him.  After being exposed for this and having more women come forward with the same complaint, Dr. Mott commits suicide.  His wife ends up having a miscarriage from the stress and has to have an emergency hysterectomy.  Six months later, a nanny shows up on Claire's doorstep looking for a job.  She is Dr. Mott's widow, only she goes by the name Peyton Flanders (played by Rebecca De Mornay).  Peyton charms her way into the Bartel home, and then sets out to destroy Claire's life.  De Mornay looks so angelic, yet can be downright frightening when she goes into one of her tirades."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"My favorite ""B"" movie","Do not buy this movie if you are into crazy well done effects, good acting, or being affraid.  This movie is absolutely hilarious!  I have seen it many times and I love it.  It is one of those movies that is so bad that it is good.  The Stuff commercials and songs in the movie are awesome!  A CLASSIC"
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Splendid !!,A previous reviewer liked the movie but not the editing. Obviously he knows a bit more about movies. I think Lady Chatterley's Lover is splendid and does justice to the classic English novel by D.H. Lawrence. The acting is on the mark and passions well conveyed. If you need an erotic movie to entice new love into bed this is a clear ulternative to outright pornography
dvd,,5.0,Brilliant,"Fox has a sordid track history when it comes to their prime time shows.  There have been plenty of series' that were canned way too early and never given the time to grow, but thankfully Fox had the good sense to give Arrested Development a fighting chance, before ultimately pulling the plug after three seasons.  Created by Mitchell Hurwitz and executive produced by Ron Howard (who also narrates) and Brian Grazer, Arrested Development tells the sordid and hilarious tale of the Bluth family, who gets rocked with controversey when their wealthy empire falls on hard times when patriarch George (Jeffrey Tambor) finds himself and jail, and son Michael (Jason Bateman) must do everything he can to keep the family together; ranging from his alcoholic, pill-popping mother (Jessica Walter), wanna-be magician brother Gob (Will Arnett), useless brother Buster (Tony Hale), his twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), her clueless husband (the hilarious and deadpan David Cross), their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat), and his own son George Michael (Michael Cera) who secretly houses a massive crush on his cousin.  Yeah, and you thought your family was weird.  A comedy that isn't for everybody, Arrested Development got by thanks to it's sharp, witty writing and amazing ensemble cast, and Howard's deft narration didn't hurt either.  Loved by critics and revered by it's loyal fans, Arrested Development struggled in the ratings department, which is a shame because it is all so rare that sitcoms are this inventive and funny.  This first season is proof of this, and it's a shame that this brilliant comedy met it's demise far too soon.  All in all, Arrested Development isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoyed the show while it was on or are looking to check it out to see what all the fuss was about, this is definitely worth picking up, as are the following seasons"
dvd,12 of 23,2.0,"No real high drama, very little conflict, unlikely story.  Good song though!","I'd never seen this 1949 film.  And there it was, beckoning me from the shelf of the New York Public Library.  There are some urban myths about John Wayne but I don't remember any of his films.  "
dvd,,5.0,Seinfeld's comic relief,"We purchased this set as a gift--a continuation of the Seinfeld DVD's. The recipients have enjoyed the first four seasons contained in a previous set. They are now in the process of watching the shows contained in this set. They report enjoying these as well. Dedicated fans, they were able to see Seinfeld's life performance in this city. Based upon their reaction, I conclude these Seinfeld DVD's are a welcomed gift, providing many hours of entertainment. The novelty items in this set are also a plus. "
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Becareful! May not be suitable for toddlers.,"I thought this movie would be a lot of fun for my 2 year old who loves Elmo. I was having fun watching it in the beginning, and wish I could have seen the entire movie. However, about 15 minutes through Elmo encounters a ""scary"" helicoptor, and a villian who takes away his blanket. My daughter burst into tears. I could only console her by skipping to the end to show that Elmo got his blanket back. Two weeks after viewing she is still talking about the scary helicoptor and mean man. She, of course, would not let me put the movie in again, no matter how I assured her it was just silly and not scary"

dvd,2 of 5,5.0,One of Ridley's best films and a sci-fi classic,"In many ways, Ridley Scott's films remind me of Brian de Palma's: many people consider him a filmmaking icon, a notable director among the many many other ones making good or bad films. Sure de Palma has his Scarface and his Untouchables but don't forget he also had the forgettable Snake Eyes and Mission to Mars. Ridley Scott meanwhile has Alien and Gladiator(overrated personally) but he does have White Squall and 1692 but chalk Blade Runner up in his more memorable films has its probably one of the better made sci-fi films of the 80's."

The story is about a terminally-ill mother has to settle on the new woman in her ex-husband's life, who will be their new stepmother. The mother dosent like the way the new women acts and the why she worksa nd has kids. The acting is good from Susan Serandon, Julia Roberta give's a great performance also.

dvd,1 of 5,1.0,Just Another Heist Movie,"&quot;Heist&quot; is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a &quot;who fools who?&quot; picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Brassed Off!,"Released at roughly the same time as ""The Full Monty,"" this gem got a lot less attention here in the states, and remains a little-known treasure for those who love British film.  True, no middle-aged men get naked on screen, but there are a lot more subtle interpersonal dynamics among the members of the ensemble cast.  And the romantic narrative between Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald is perhaps a little pat, but is certainly one of the most realistic and nuanced love stories in recent cinema."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Crystal Clear Voice & Breath by breath,"I read comments about her voice being cold and unapproachable. I bought this DVD anyway (Introductory & Beginner). I found that her voice is crystal clear, calm and confident."
dvd,,5.0,Tenacious D- The Complete Master Works,Awsome DVD package.  I also liked the suggestions given about other items I might like.
dvd,,4.0,Fun family film!,"Troop Beverly Hills is the perfect fun ""girls night"" film with hilarious throw-backs to our Girl Scout days.  The plot centers around the failing marriage of Phyllis Nefler and Freddy Nefler.  When Phyllis agrees to become the leader of her daughter's wilderness girl troop, she hopes it will show him that she's still the woman he married.  As she leads Troop Beverly Hills through thick and thin, the movie is funny, heart-warming, and entertaining.  Shelly Long stars"
dvd,4 of 9,4.0,So Far....,"I have watched 8 of the 50 movies.  Start at the beginning.  First off the quality of the picture isn't that bad, it's what you would expect from ventage movies.  You'll see a dust spot here or a scratch there on some of the movies, but its not enough to worry about.  I'm actually pleased of how good the quality is, so far. One complaint is that the characters in the stories just don't mesh, its hard to feel compassion for most characters, I suppose it's because back in that time people were more unsophisticated.  Recently I have viewed..."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Entertainment & Excitement,"My son (almost 4) is crazy about airplanes so I purchased this DVD based on the other reviews already written for this DVD.  I thought it could possibly be a little above what he could conceptually understand as it was a more ""behind the scenes"" type show and didn't have a lot of actual display flying in it but I was wrong. My son has been glued to this DVD every evening for a week!"
dvd,,5.0,quirky colorful and fun,"Yes, this murder mystery is twisted and dark, but also wonderful to watch.  All the characters (with the possible exception of the father) are so intriguing and bizarre...and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat.  What a nasty family, but one can't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates.  They put the fun in the word dysfunctional, without a doubt.  Beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery.  True that it is primarily shot indoors, but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright.  Maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot, I don't know, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes.  The story itself is pretty good, and not difficult to follow, but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss.     "
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,FOUR STARS,"This was the last movie that I ever watched with my father before he passed away.  So this movie has alot of sentimental meaning but it's a great movie for children.  I saved mine for my daughter to watch.  Batty is so funny and the singing in this movie is great.  Though Hexas used to scare me when I was younger I loved this movie and I'm in my 20s and I still know every word to it.  For parents out there looking for a good movie with a good message, this is the movie you're looking for"
dvd,0 of 5,5.0,Midniyt,"I love this movie. Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are great! The movie has many hidden meanings or reaches ppl on differnt levels, however you like to take it. Either way, it is definately worth watching at least once, and i on the other hand, had to own it. Great movie"
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Documentary of a Legend,"I'll put this review in perspective, this is the only product I have ever purchased on Amazon solely on the basis of the prerelease e-mail.  I was a huge fan of the band and was at the 9:30 show in DC that is on Disc 2.  I had no idea that it was videotaped.  Just to say this about these guys, d. boon hung out at the club exit after the show and chatted with fans as they left and I got a chance to thank him personally for putting out all that great music."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,dave chappelle's show is golden(and that ain't no shower)!,"    this was and still is one of the best skit comedy shows out at the time. dave's natural gift of comedy is very well suited to this outrageous and howling,profaine,and insightful show. mr. chappelle has taken some great bits and turned skit comedy on it's ear! this set isn't for everyone,but if like me the skit of the blind,black white supermacist(watch to understand) is just the funniest bit i have seen in years."
dvd,,5.0,"""Keep on going, buddy, keep on going down the line...""","""Ahoy Noah, Your looking kind o' grizzly..."""
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,The Torch song singer,"I found the movie to be wonderful, funny and true to life. The service from Amazon.com to be prompt, efficient, dependable, the delivery was on time and product in excellent condition"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Ahh the Classics.,This set is worth it with just to have Bringing up Baby and The Philadelphia Story. Seeing as the two of them seperatly cost more than this set and you get four extra films. Can you say Bargain?
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,One of Hollywood's Great Epic Films,"DR. ZHIVAGO was one of the last great epic films produced by Hollywood. In the 1950's and 60's, a string of films were produced that resembled closely resembled grand opera without music: the casts were large, the stories intricate, and the settings spectacular. Some were great successes such as BEN HUR. Others are notable disasters, with CLEOPATRA perhaps being the best known example. DR. ZHIVAGO may be the most enduring of these epic films. It's based on a novel by Boris Pasternak that was banned in the USSR which only added to the fascination of audiences in the United States. The film boasts of an all star cast. It has one of the most beloved musical scores. It seems that no expense was spared in the filming. It was also a bit shocking for some American audiences in terms of material. Few American films in the early 1960's dealt with a man who loved two women with love scenes to boot! Of course it would be tame and perhaps too simplistic fare for an audience of today, but it was daring at the time."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Good for kids. Good for adults.,I think this is the sort of movie that should be done for all the family. It's not only funny and beautiful. It deals with lots of touchstones for kids and for adults.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Excellent, big hearted film","""That Frank, he lives inside of his own heart. That's an awful big place to live in."" "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Jennifer Ehle Shines as Elizabeth B.,"This production of P&P is the best I've ever seen on screen.  Jennifer Ehle was brilliantly cast as Elizabeth. The music, the set locations, and the acting performances were perfect. I am so violently in Love with the character of Elizabeth Bennet, Jennifer is GLOROIUS!"
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,You will either love it or Hate it.,People who watch this movie either love it or hate it. 
dvd,25 of 26,5.0,The Gold Standard,"The more you understand Pilates, the more you understand it is a very, very challenging exercise method. As far as I'm concerned, this video shows Reformer equipment exercises better than any other video. This Universal Reformer Series demonstrates the most comprehensive and professional and attractive way of practicing Pilates."
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,"this is joy, definitely watch it","definitely worth watching. all these people emerging from the decadence of 1910s and avant-garde of 20s thus bringing a charming mix of mannerism and crude realism. Joan Crawford's shoulders move should be taught in acting schools (do they already?). and damn, can Garbo take on camera! nowdays they cannot last more than 5 seconds of closeup without their faces desolving until they all start resembling one giant boring motionless face of Keanu Reeves doing ""no spoon"""
dvd,,2.0,The Horror of Hypocrity,"I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.  "
dvd,8 of 9,4.0,a love story undiminished by time,"An immortal wartime romance with Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten, I'LL BE SEEING YOU remains one of the most beloved films of the era.  Rogers plays Mary Marshall, a female ex-con on parole, who meets by chance the handsome yet severely shell-shocked soldier Zachary Morgan (Cotten).  Their romance plays out against the odds; two damaged people who find comfort and understanding in each other."
dvd,6 of 7,1.0,Which version is this?,"There are two versions of Deep Red/The Hatchet Murder here but amazon has stupidly replicated the same set of reviews for both of them! Is this the uncut version with the italian language scenes that all the reviews speak so highly of, or is this the cut-to-crap not-even-worth-watching american version"
dvd,,5.0,A perennial favorite,"This cast is awesome. The music is upbeat and beautiful. The Prince's lament is my favorite, and Bernadette Peters is still the best thing to happen to broadway. I saw this cast live in NYC and hits DVD is a reminder of how much fun and energy was in the cast. A great purchase"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Coen Brothers do it again,"it never ceases to amaze me how the Coen brothers make me love movies from genres that i don't usually like. take this film for instance, its been out for six years, when it came out i said it looks dumb, i don't like stories about hillbillies, but thats not what it is at all, its actually a great film with all kinds of twists and turns. in a word it can be described as delightful, with the most fun part of o'brother being that it keeps you guessing throughout, just when you think one thing is going to happen, bam, supprise, something else. i really enjoyed the music too, i can't get that damn soggy bottom boys song outta my head, and i doubt you'll be able to either. my only regret is that i was to ignorant to watch it sooner, i hope you really enjoy this film as much as i did."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Gremlins?,The film is based in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere.
dvd,1 of 8,2.0,Well done movie...,"... But is is not the truth. Since the wall fell, we have learned that old joe was right. Hey, I bet in a few years Clooney will make a film about how honest and truthful Bill Clinton was"
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,This is a Masterpiece!,"Raging Bull is #24 in the 100 Best American movies ever, and it is among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. Later on was named the best movie of the decade (80's), which I think is true. I rate this movie 5 stars or 9.5/10. It was nominated for eight 1980 Oscars, but won only two: De Niro for Best Actor, and Thelma Schoonmaker for her editing (the Academy seems to have a problem with Scorsese). Schoonmaker appears on one of the audio commentaries of the movie, along with Martin Scorsese, producer, the real LaMotta and others. This DVD is exactly what we collectors like about special edition DVDs. The package is beautifully done (Yes! The package matters a lot), containing a small booklet with some short essays and pictures of the movie. Then, this special edition comes with a second DVD full of special features, such as 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes, a making of documentary, trailers, and some other very interesting stuff."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,At Last!,"Being a classic movie fan born 5 years after this film's initial release, I have always heard about it, read about it, even saw a parody of its title (in a WB cartoon -- I think featuring Tweety -- called ""The High and the Flighty""), but have never seen it (nor heard the beautiful theme song), and felt I never would after John Wayne's death and hearing it was locked up in his estate.  In summer 2005 I went to a video store and the minute I saw the title, I knew I had to have it.  It's clearly a picture of its times, and the granddaddy of the ""Airport"" movies that followed in the 70s.  "
dvd,,5.0,excellent acting and a heart-warming story,"I appreciate the acting of Keri Russell and Skeet Ulrich so much more are after viewing this film.  (This is no Felicity!)  This story takes place during World War II, but its theme is modern...a young woman who has plans for a career as an archaeologist finds herself unexpectedly pregnant, and unexpectedly married to a young man in a marriage arranged by her father.  She slowly realizes that what seems like purgatory - living an isolated farm, married to a stranger - actually has the potential to make her happy.  The story reminds us that sometimes life is enriched when we release control and are open to the unexpected"
dvd,8 of 11,4.0,"A very good, ridiculously maligned film","From the folks who brought us Spy Hard (1996) and the Scary Movie horror spoof series (the first arrived in 2000), Date Movie is a spoof of modern romantic comedies.  The flow of comedy material is similar to the Scary Movies.  Roughly, from scene to scene, different films are spoofed, with a couple overarching spoofs acting as the vehicles, and the style of humor has an emphasis on absurdism and pushing-the-boundaries outrageousness.  So if you've seen any of the Scary Movies, you should know what to expect here, and if you've enjoyed them and you have some familiarity with romantic comedies, you should enjoy this film also."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Virtuosity,"""Radiohead: The Astoria London Live"" is worth a watch by anyone who hasn't been a fan from the beginning.  It is an electrifying performance from start to finish that chronicles the evolution of new material that would eventually end up on ""The Bends.""  It's hard to appreciate exactly how innovative and imaginative Radiohead is without watching them perform their intense, multi-layered parts.  If I'm a target audience, then here's my two-cents: I want more LIVE Radiohead.  "
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Grab the tissues!,"ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE IS HISTORICALLY INACCURATE, IT IS STILL A WONDERFUL DISNEY MOVIE. I SAW THIS BACK WHEN I WAS 13 AND 9 YEARS LATER IT STILL TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS."
dvd,,1.0,Price gouging!,$174.99 is ridiculous!  You guys keep upping the price!  I paid $114.99 elsewhere
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"To see the fount of evil, we must look into ourselves...","Most films lose a lot of force if you know to much about the subject, this one is different. The more the viewer knows, the more horrifying the film becomes."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,I Am The Walrus,"I give it 5 because it is the only known video of I Am The Walrus!! One of my favorite Beatles tunes. The movie itself was a flop, not going over well with the critics. I like it, and have been looking for it, and found it here!!"
dvd,,1.0,The Chopped it up,We saw the movie in the theatre and loved it. The DVD we just purchased was horrible. They chopped out so much of the movie it made it un-watchable. It is only good for a coaster under my drink now
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Out of the way with Stephanie Kay!,"I'm in my early 20's, so I didn't really watch Degrassi Junior High when it was on. But my boyfriend, whom prior to this DVD being released would go on and on about how much he loved the show, exposed me to this show. At first I laughed and said ""Why do you like this cheesy kid stuff?"". Honestly, alot of the acting and settings are hoakey...but then there's honest human drama that we can all relate to, and you get the sensation of peeking into a real school."
dvd,,5.0,A Masterpiece. Fires On All Cylinders,"Though it's a bit tough to get to in one sitting (it's 172 minutes), Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama masterpiece ""Heat"" is ultimately one of the most satisfying film experiences one can enjoy. Starring two of the greatest actors in history (Al Pacino & Robert De Niro) sharing the screen together for the first time ever, backed by a great story and an equally fantastic supporting cast, ""Heat"" has been one of the last truly great movies to come out in the last 10 or so years, and it's truly a classic."
dvd,2 of 7,5.0,Greatest concert ever,"I was very fortunate to be in London on july 2nd 2005. spending sometime with friends when we knew about this concert. we watch some on the tv and the last performances by Robbie Williams, The Who, Pink Floyd (first time in my life seeing them live) & Paul McCartney where/are completely awesome. "
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Crazy dark stuff, This is a great movie the second time will only be better...... Dont pay attention to the people who say dont buy it because its such bad quality who cares its fine... JUST WATCH THE MOVIE AND ENJOY THE CRAZYNESS AND DARKNESS
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Bravo!,"I wish I could give this series more than five stars -- it is perhaps the best documentary series I've seen.  I concur with the high praise given by the other reviewers.  I'd like to highlight the exceptional attention to detail and finesse brought to bear in this series.  The narrative is extremely well-crafted, examining the many subplots in this complex war in way that is still easy to follow.  The use of personal letters of ordinary people throughout humanized these events.  The silent film footage is enlivened by exacting sound effects added to replicate the action being seen (e.g., you can actually hear the sound of snow crunching beneath the feet of Italian soldiers marching through the mountains in winter).  Splicing in footage of areas as they are today also lends perspective.  The narrator skillfully guides us through the storyline without dominating the action as occurs in some other documentaries.  In short, ""The First World War"" is documentary film-making at its best; it works at all levels.  It should be a model for future documentary film makers."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Best Faith Based Video on the Market,"Despite some of the negative reviews, we bought this video for our 1 year old son.  He loves it and the other videos in this series.  Our son is now two and just today he thanked God in his prayer for ""God made me"".  I thought that was very cute and shows how much he enjoys these videos.  They hold his attention even better than the Einstein videos and as parents we like the fact that he's being introduced to stories from the Bible.  The music is recognizable to me yet done in a child friendly way.  He likes the images of other kids and the catchy sound effects.  You and your babies will love this video"
dvd,11 of 17,2.0,Not enough variation,"Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments.  The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves.  If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Awesome dancers !,"I loved this tape just to watch these guys dance-Whoa ! The moves are fun and some are incredibly hard, but they film it from alot of different angles so you get the drift of it. I'd recommend this tape to any aspiring hip hop or break dancers, but make sure you warm up if youre not a trained dancer . great stuff !!"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,The series was on a roll here; no extras but who cares?,"""Bewitched"" was a classic TV series for its first four seasons (and bits of seasons five, six and seven are worth watching--but avoid season eight!), spinning out family-oriented humor which nonetheless directly explored issues involving marriage, feminism and even the counterculture (represented by Samantha's magical world, which had much in common with the emerging folk/hippie movement, versus the straight proto-yuppie world Darrin and Larry come from).  The characters were always colorful, the plots largely original (at least, up until season five or so) and Elizabeth Montgomery was absolutely stunning as Samantha, while Agnes Moorehead was regal as Endora.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Fu&*king Hilarious!,"Lately, I've been disappointed with all the new comedies that are coming out now days.  Movies like Shriek if you know what I did last friday the 13th, Date movie, Grandma's boy, Las Vegas bachellor party, and etc have not met my expectations but I saw this one with high reviews so I purchased it hoping it'd be at least decent but found it to be hilarious.  For those who are sick of the new comedies coming out now days I highly recommend this one.  A definite good buy"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Newlyweds Season 2-3,"Very funny, I love the ""Jessica"" moments. If you loved the first season, you'll love this one even more"
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,The good old days,"Watching this again makes me remember that I really wanted to get it on with Caitlin Ryan when I was a kid. I love that girl. Also, I love the Zit Remedy. What a band!! This is a great guilty pleasure to have. Also, I love Spike. She is soooo easy. Slutty, but cute. She looks pretty decent now a days too. Great show"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Herskovitz and Zwick bring the drama of divorce to prime time television,"I do not know if I can take another television series created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.  When they came out with ""thirtysomething"" in 1987 it was like watching our lives on TV.  I can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of Michael, Hope and the gang.  Then in 1999 they came back with ""Once and Again,"" and all I can is that I hate to think what would have happened if I was not already where the characters ended up in the third season, because if I was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful.  In fact, I would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs, twist the knife, or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,almost perfect,"These films look really good cleaned up, only thing George shouldn't of changed/added was the Greedo/Han scene in episode 4, the Han walking over Jabbas tail scene in episode 4, and the change to the end scene in episode 6 at the end where yoda, obi-wan, and anakin are all standing together smiling at luke. Replacing the old darth vader with the actor from episode 3 was just plain out dumb. "
dvd,2 of 7,1.0,DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE,"Beside Sorum another Tartan Asia Extreme movie. This is by far one of the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie also has no plot! In another hand if you like to see a movie full of gruesome pictures like a man stabbing himself or like the movie Tomie then this is the right movie for you, but I really think this is a very poor movie! SO save your money and do not buy this movie"
dvd,,5.0,Roseanne: Halloween Edition,This is a great DVD for the whole family. It has Roseanne & Dan at their best: HALLOWEEN!! Will give you hours and hours of laughs & enjoyment. You must have this DVD to complete your Roseanne collection
dvd,,5.0,Excellent,"Do you remember having to read this story in high school literature? I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now.  The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination.  It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance, intrigue, sword fights, action. Definitely a movie to add to your collection. "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,THis aiN'T No HiTChCoCK HOMage.....,"Let me put it like this, this movie is not a big deal, a head scratcher, please, HELL NO.! I just like it cause it FUN, I mean Melaine Griffith as a Porn Star is so funny ...more Camp than Thrills for me and Frankie goes to Hollywood indeed "" Relax...Don't do it"" and Mr. De Palma's last shot while the credits are rolling is CLASSIC. Dont think, just watch !;"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,Sympathetic script!,This is a nice entertainment that deals with several issues. The management subject when a woman is hired as Creative director of famous Advertising Enterprise; but in the other hand explores (and here is the hook) the feminine thought thanks to a curious accident suffered by Gibson. This fact will lead to laughable situations that will conclude in an expected happy ending.
dvd,,2.0,Still updated even after all these years!,I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia.
dvd,3 of 8,5.0,An excellent film with powerful performances.,"The deer hunter is one of the greatest films that Robert de niro starred in its also highly emotional and provocative, the scenes in Vietnam are very intense and describes how the American soldiers are affected by this meaningless war and how they deal with it in thier own personal ways. The whole cast is superb which includes Deniro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale and Meryl Streep all of them were excellent and make these characters seem more real. As Deniro gets back home to the U.S. he is unable to shake his feelings and is still devestated by what happened, when he goes on a hunting trip with his friends he does not pull the trigger once he sees the deer in his sight but it seems that his friends were affected more as one of them is mentaly disturbed and is not like himself anymore, Deniro visits him in the hospital and hopes that he becomes better. The film also has the famous russian roulette scenes that were the highlight and makes for an unforgettable story of survival. The film's message was about how tragic and sad war can really be and how much impact it has on ordinary people it is very much essential viewing especially for those stupid republicans who support the war on Iraq thousands of lives are being killed and they think it just doesn't affect them, they should realise that both sides start to suffer anyway the film was quite extrodinary and I highly recommend this war drama."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Jean Harlow Sizzles in Dinner at Eight,"Dinner at Eight is one of the earliest films I have had the pleasure to see.  It certainly was a product of its times--the Great Depression, replete with financial empires on the brink, aging theater stars, gold-digging vixens, and wealthy patricians seemingly immune to the tremendous suffering all around them."
dvd,1 of 5,1.0,"Ego trip anyone? (emphasis on ""trip"")","Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all. "
dvd,2 of 3,2.0,Very disappointing and without direction,"As a fan of Homer and Virgil I have to say this was one of the most disappointing movies seen in some time.   After the early scene of the ""thousand ships"" which was incredible, the plot slid quickly downhill.   Mr. Pitt did a good job with the character of Achilles and others were acceptable in their roles but so much of the story had been changed that it not only made an Odyssey sequel problematic but robbed the story of the wonderful reconciliation stories that followed.   The characters become one-dimensional and unbelievable from a script that took far too many liberties in attempts to ""improve"" a story that has stood the test of millenia.   Sad that the director/writers could not have left well enough alone and just told the story as it was meant to be told without the improvements of individuals noticably less talented than Virgil or Homer.   It gains two stars for the stunning photography and visual effects but loses other stars for its tedious and directionless plot"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,I love this stuff!,"I'm the father of a budding musician and I once played the small town American Legion hall, and high school hops, coming out of the garage. Valence's manager may dispute some of the details of this movie, but it's not History Channel, it's a movie, and I could relate to a lot of the details concerning early musicianship. It had a nice, REAL feel to it. Now I can better appreciate Los Lobos, too, who participated in musical aspects of the movie. I watch Valence's first encounter with ""La Bamba"" over and over again. The transformation of classical/folk guitar to electric fascinates me."
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,Master OF The Rare LASERDISCS Movies.,"I guess I am lucky havin' Sucha  GREAT movie ON LASERDISC Ain't I? Summer SCHOOL is Kinda Movie That you will never Forget,'tis a great Comedy/Romantic,I bought it on DVD too And I recommend you to do The Same,,you aint gonna regret it this ONE :"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Van Damme takes it to a whole new level...,"If you would of said Van Damme back in 1990,people would of responded he was in Bloodsport or Kickboxer which were simply martial art type of films.Van Damme stepped up to the level with Schwarzenegger and Stallone in this box-office hit.Even though jail movies have been done before like Stallones ""Lockup"" and Sean Penn's ""Bad Boy's"" Death Warrant took it into overtime,having a convincing villian in the ""Sandman"" and a believing hero in Van Damme.An undercover cop in jail?Dangerous if you ask me but Van Damme fights the odds and comes up victorious in an all out supercharged war.With fast pace kicks and fight sequences Van Damme is your ticket to nonstop action.."
dvd,5 of 11,2.0,This goes against A Kid! This is the counter example that must be!,"Wow. Unlike most people I wasn't that worried about CN taking  a hand of the second Big 0 series. The fact that they were likely doing it for money didn't worry me in the least. I knew they would do their best to deliver a quality work and continue on with the spirit of Big O. If you liked the first season but are denying yourself the second, you are making a big mistake. Don't let Kid's review scare you away either. That is neither proven nor acknowledged as a theory for the series. It is just one possible interpatation. To set those of you that have fears at rest, I will deliver a counter-example. For everything the Kid said there is a counter example that makes the events of Paragdrim real and the ones in the first episode as false. These are spoilers for the first episode, but please read it! Especially if you read Kid's review... it is a counter to that. "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Cube was a great movie,This was a great movie.  True the Cube was a trap but it showed the greatest danger was the people inside.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Pieces of April,"Those who printed the cover on this DVD made a very bad mistake. They called it wickedly humorous. That made me sit back and say, ""Okay, make me laugh,"" and under those conditions it couldn't. But if you just kick back, relax, and watch the damn movie, you'll enjoy it. Original characters, original story, a couple of spots where it takes itself too seriously, and just a good movie in spite of its flaws. And a rare gem because I'm able to give it a short review. "
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,requiem,I just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone's MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.  
dvd,0 of 7,2.0,Sour Note,"No wonder they didn't produce any other live action productions of Dr. Seuss books until after his death.  This film gave me a headache.  The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly.  At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were.  I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago.  Do check out the ""Gerald McBoing-Boing"" cartoon thats included on the disc.  It contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than ""Dr. T"" does in ninety minutes"
dvd,,5.0,The Truth is Too SAD to acknowledge.. This movie Shows it with Humor,"I have seen the other reviews and agree with them in the main. This movie is absolutely worth the cost. When you have read and know the incredible pain visited on children by institutions like this, it is good to be told in a humorous way of the pain visited upon these children. It is definitely worth seeing especially after reading about these torture camps. If it evens open the eyes of one parent or caregiver, it will have been worth it. "
dvd,1 of 6,1.0,sum of all stars? zero!,"Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled ""reapeat"".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Great Movie with an Amazing Cast,The DVD is great. Lots of Subtitle options not to mention the fact that the Movie is just simply amazing with a great Cast
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Your Mission if You choose to Accept It,Tom Cruise's third (and his last) Mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels. It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of  Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy&lt; It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise.
dvd,,2.0,disappointing -- especially for the x-men fans!,"If you have read (and enjoyed) any of the X-men, save your $, buy the graphic novel of the original dark Phoenix saga, and pretend this movie wasn't made.  If you want to see some special effects & aren't that hung up on character development, I'd still just rent it"
dvd,1 of 5,1.0,the name says it all,this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen.
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"""You gotta shake it before you bake it...""","As most every one of my friends is privy, I am a HUGE fan of Will Ferrell.  I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me.  That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell.  As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast.  The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are ""if your not first, your last"" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life.  Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place."
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,Absolutely Fantastic!,"For true fans of traditional Irish music, Danu in particular, this DVD will be a real treat.  Filmed live at Dublin's Vicar St., it's full of lively tunes, and haunting songs sung by the incomparable Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh.  But it doesn't end there.  There are extras and interviews included on this DVD.  The fan is able to gain a bit of insight into the lives of these outstanding musicians.  It's very enjoyable, and sometimes humorous, to watch.  It also contains a few fun surprises you won't want to miss.  Like Des Dillon and his wee accordion playing protege.  He also has a lively dancing partner who's very talented for her age.  Buy this DVD now! You won't be disappointed"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Great Movie - Must Buy If You Love Westerns,"This is an amazing work of art. A must buy for anyone who loves westerns. (Anyone who loves Sergio Leone already has it.) The documentary is interesting also. It is all testosterone, however, so if you do not like that sort of thing (not necessarily that your are a ""chick""), you will hate this movie and not appreciate the art. If you liked the Clint Eastwood westerns (especially Good, Bad, Ugly, done by Leone), this is your next step. Big Characters and Big Themes, done Big, but beautifully well."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Claudette Colbert and writer-director Preston Sturges: it doesn't get better,"By 1942, screwball comedies had become quite old-fashioned, nevertheless when THE PALM BEACH STORY was released it became one of the top box-office winners of the year, and garnered much praise for it's stars, and writer-director Preston Sturges."
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,So Far So Very Good 20th Century Fox !!!!,"These past DVD sets have been fantastic and the tansfers are great!!! As we go forward with the new color seasons, can you include form the vaults the all exciting preview scenes from next week................that would truly make this series a superb collection!!!!!!!!!  By the way The Time Tunnel sets were outstanding....you guys at 20th really know what you are doing, keep it up!!!!!!!!!"
dvd,,1.0,Complete waste of time!,"The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a ""Forrest Gump"" imitation.  Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying. "
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,tough guys abound,"these movies are well made, and being a classic movie fan like these titles and stars. keep it up warner brother"

dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Greatest horror movie EVER!!!,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has to do with a group of kids all having nightmares that have the same man in common.  After nights of tormenting the children, the bogeyman strikes, and kills one of the girls.  Then one by one the others are picked off until finally Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is left.  It turns out the man in all their dreams is the ghost of a child killer Freddy Kruger, who was murdered years before by the parents of his victims.  Now Nancy must confront Freddy and defeat him or else she is next."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,The love of many,This film is a bit different but also about survival during the war years. One must do what they can to live. A young woman gets caught up in an underground movement. To escape she leaves her familiar life.  Will she find her lover?  Will she be found out by the Nazi?  Her future lies with the common folk of a small village.  Please take your time to see this lovely movie.
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,"""Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!""","Now you can relive the nostalgia all over again whenever you want with Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends on this new DVD.  The producers have taken into account who would buy and ultimately watch this and other Rocky & Bullwinkle DVD's by painstakingly compiling content in the exact order that it first aired on television back in the 70's.  The quality is pristine and looks even better that I originally watched it as a kid on my rabbit ear'd TV set.  The packaging has original-style artwork and the accordian packaging keeps all enclosed disks managable.  The DVD's are 2-sided play however with no labeling to show which side is which except for the small print around the inner ring which makes it difficult to know which disk is first, second, third etc.  Overall, the Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends DVD is one of my most prized DVD possessions in my collection.          "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Masterpiece,"No aspect of Lessons of Darkness can be praised too highly. What I'd like to know is, how can I find out the artists who performed the various musical works? Herzog has chosen the most sublime renditions of his sublime selection: Verdi's &quot;Recordare&quot; from the Requiem, and similarly the best of Strauss, Wagner and so on. I'd like to gt the same recordings. Any help? Thanks in advance: send to johnwood@umich.ed"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Outstanding, authentic, and heartwarming","Excellent acting and good story. I had never heard of this movie until I picked up a discounted copy. But this movie is a blessing, telling the tale of man muddling through life and finally realizing that his true love is by his side all along. Classy romance of the highest caliber, and a story that makes you think and reflect. A definite two thumbs up. An undiscovered gem"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,who's having a baby?,"   BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies.  she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like ""sweet sixteen"" or ""breakfast club"".  Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day.  Soundtrac is great with kate bush ""the woman's work"".  My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played.  i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife.  boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever."
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,"Visually Beautiful, Masterwork of Director and two fine actors","This film is a classic for all the right reasons: a truly great story of two epic lives entwining, two powerful actors, great Direction by Carol Reed, and luscious, artistic cinematography by Leon Shamroy (Academy Award nominated for Cinematography)."
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,"Funny, poignant, masterful","City Lights, a film that took Chaplin more time to make than any of his other features, is a masterpiece of comedy and romance. Chaplin again plays the Little Tramp, but this time he finds a blind flowergirl (who mistakenly takes him for a millionaire) and decides that he will take various oddjobs to get enough money to restore her sight. While not Chaplin's funniest, this is easily his most touching and human work. If the final shot of this film doesn't make your eyes water, you're not human. It's beautiful and Chaplin's best"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Interesting Movie,"It isn't great drama, but all in all it is interesting. Craig Ferguson is great in it, he even sings.  He make the whole film worth watching."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"By no means a miss, but not exactly a smash hit. Fred Astaire's last leading man role in a movie musical","There are a number of good things about Silk Stockings, but there also is a professional finality about the movie that makes it easier to observe than to be delighted by it. It was one of the last of the big MGM musicals coming from Arthur Freed's production unit. It was the last musical Fred Astaire made as the lead. It was the last film directed by Rouben Mamoulian. It was based on the last Broadway musical Cole Porter wrote. Silk Stockings also was used to make a statement about the excesses some thought were ruining films and music...the advent of rock and roll and the technological changes in films with wide screen and stereo sound. It even takes a crack at the fashion for ballet in many musicals. You've got to be very clever and original to successfully parody things which are already self-parodies. Silk Stockings, even with its many entertaining moments, isn't that clever."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Horror Classic.,"Even though it seems cheesy, even laughable today, there's no denying ""The Evil Dead"" is still a landmark moment in the horror genre. Made for virtually no budget by a group of struggling young filmmakers straight out of college, ""The Evil Dead"" became one of the most original films in the horror genre as well as films in general, and is still vastly entertaining today."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,great cowboy movie,This movie was great in my opionion.It deals with every aspect of being in a rodeo and being a cowboy. I love this much as much as 8 Seconds.Their both great! The ending is VERY sad and yes I shedded some tears....if you can't handle seeing some extremely saddening part this movie isn't for you
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Oldboy - Oh Boy,"Ok wow. This film is messed up. It totally left me speechless. Oh Dae-su, a Korean family man is forcefully imprisoned for 15 years with no explanation. Upon his release he sets out to revenge his captors and understand why it all happened. What ensues is a hardcore psychological thriller with plot twists, cool fight scenes, a superb narrative style, and sweet cinematography. This film went gangbusters on the festival circuit pulling down some prestigious awards, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's mainstream. Bring this film to any conservative mother and you will see one of two things: a forceful backlash or a permanent nervous twitch from trauma. The film is stunning, but I recommend it only to people with their mind wide open"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,My favorite pilates video so far,"I have 4 pilates videos now and this is by far my favorite. The fact that a full pilates workout is condensed nicely into 20 minutes is fantastic. The instructor saves time by not talking or breaking between exercises during the first run through, and there is just music. If you want detailed instruction there is a second part that goes through the whole routine and explains everything very well. The routine continues to be challenging, but wasn't overly difficult to get started with when I was not in my best shape. I actually look forward to doing this every day instead of having to force myself into it. I highly recommend this video"
dvd,10 of 19,5.0,Enough already!!!!!! Not guilty.,"  This whole situation is sickening, for many reasons, most of all that people still won't admit to there bungling.  I asked a friend of mine what he thought of this while WM3 situation, he shrugged his shoulders and said ""They eat there young down there"".  His attitude seems to reflect that of many people, that the subjects of this film (Including the murdered boys) were subhuman and it didn't matter what happened to them.  This attitude seems to be reflected in the actions of the so-called authorities who mismanaged this case from the get go.  Anyone with eyes can see the confession was laughable, that in any other state, almost, it would never have been admissible, but the individuals, I think, simply pinned the murder on these three simple minded boys, then railroaded them based on peoples ignorance and fear.  They cared less then not at all for the people they convicted and for the victims even less, they just wanted somebody, anybody to pin this on and they went with it.  When compelling evidence is found afterward to prove they are not guilty, they just ignore it so they don't look bad.  All that matters is that they are right, not the murdered children or the WM3, who cares about a bunch of inbred, illiterate morons with bad teeth?  They live in trailer courts and they talk funny, so what?  It is frustrating to watch and even more so as time goes on.  It's one thing to show a travesty taking place, it is another to have everyone else see it and then pretend it's not there?  Why do those who think they are guilty not make there own documentary, why not prove themselves right?  I hope the people responsible get what they deserve....but they won't"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,BEST NEW SCI-FI SERIES OF 2005,"Does the government have a plan in the event of an extraterrestrial encounter? If so, what would that plan look like. ""Threshold"" offers answers to these and other interesting questions and attempts to answer these questions realistically, in terms of the present world situation. Instead of playing on populist anti-government, conspiracy sentiments, ""Threshold"" takes us inside the minds of the government conspiracists, shows us their perspective and the logic of their actions. In the wake of the Patriot Act, 9-11 fears of foreigners, and the complex world of modern technology, ""Threshold"" takes all that and within a well conceived story arc offers episodes that act partly as social commentary on the predicament of humans/Americans at this point in time. Offering us glimpses into concerns that we should take to heart, but doesn't offer simple, pat answers. Is the U.S. government too big and powerful? Can it be trusted to safeguard the lives of Americans/humans? If you're tired of rehashed sci-fi storylines, predictable ""go nowhere"" plots, and unbelievably corny space operas, ""Threshold"" may be what you've been looking for. Often described as a cross between ""X-Files"", ""Twin Peaks"" and ""CSI"", ""Threshold"" is an adventure you won't want to miss"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Fun step routine with lower body toning...,"I like this workout, it is about an hour long and while it is billed as a step workout, there are lots of toning moves for the lower body as well.  Overall a good leg and bun shaper and you will feel it.  Led by Kathy Smith, she is joined by a fairly large class, mostly female who are of various fitness levels. "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,This is one of Van Damme's BEST!,"I saw this movie earlier this year, very good effects, stunts, fights, characters, story, acting and all! The entire package is there! I would recommend getting this movie on DVD. Its one of Van Damme's BEST films ever"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excelente!!!,"Esta es un clasico de mi generaci�n. Muy buena pelicula, excelentes actores y un soundtrack increible. La recomiendo totalmente!"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Everyone should have a Ferris,My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.  This is a classic that every high school student should see.  It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Fried Green Tomatoes,The copyright on this film is 1991. It is now 2005. Are Jan and I the last two people on the planet to see this film? I don't care. I'm reviewing it anyway. 
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,cool stuff,"I enjoy this movie, to see a young character initiate what will hopefully become a lifelong process of growth and development--perhaps by the side of a loving woman who's capable of continualy encouraging and motivating the guy to follow through. To see him reach that critical age and foresight that certain actions, behaviors, and old habits wont take you very far in life and that you really should have a plan in place--sort of like that chinese proverb saying something to the effect that the road of life has in it many forks, and if you dont know what you end destination is you're bound to get lost."
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,A Great Film and Kirk Douglas' Best Performance,"     This film is a true treasure and deserves the highest praise. The movie was made with much respect for both painters Van Gogh and Gauguin. And it shows. Whenever I have viewed it, it has made me want to be right there as the story really happened. I cannot say that for any other film I have seen. I'm very happy it is finally being released on DVD in widescreen 1/31/06. A nice 50 year anniversary treat!"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Just Charming,This is a classic Hollywood musical that should be in everyone's dvd library. The dvd transfer is crisp and clean. And the film itself is just charming.
dvd,,4.0,"Finally, a family film"," A modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you, your grandmother or young child. The scenery was magnificent and the story, well, let's just enjoy it for the unoffensive entertainment. You rooted for the good guy, the bad guy got his ""come-uppance"" and no worries about language or nudity. Yes, of course, that is the norm today and you can see it anytime you wish and anyplace you go, so I was so pleased not to wince every five minutes. Go, get your popcorn, curl up on the couch perhaps weep a little weep. and enjoy a rarity today, (at least in my opinion,) a movies that lets you feel good when you're done. "
dvd,25 of 25,5.0,A Love of the Heart,"There is a romantic glow to this very undervalued film. It is a throwback to films of the 40's and 50's. Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep give old style performances to match the story's atmosphere, which is sweet and sentimental. It does not make light of the subject matter of having an affair but instead is a film about finding love itself. In keeping with that theme, the romantic feelings of the two leads are never allowed to reach their natural conclusion. The love that gently blossoms is one of the heart."
dvd,115 of 117,1.0,Old Transfers...Beware.,"Warner Brothers have reissued The Searchers in 2004, the transfer being stated as 1:1.85 aspect ratio.  In this package they are disposing of their old 1997 copies - this has a double sided disc, with a cropped 4:3 version on one side, and, even worse, on the flip side a widescreen version where the vertical image has been significantly cropped (the tops of actors' heads are often lopped off, and the magnificent landscapes are similarly ridiculously framed - to see what you are missing, just flip over to the 4:3 version: the heads and mesas and buttes are seen in full, but of course the horizontal image is severely cropped) - the stated aspect ratio is 1.75:1.  "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A Modern Masterpiece,"A Streetcar Named Desire, was ""a modern masterpiece"" that ""took Broadway by storm."" Considered by many to be the finest drama of America's finest post-war playwright, A Streetcar Named Desire made an indelible impression on American culture. Under the muscular direction of Elia Kazan, the incendiary play, which won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Critics' Circle Award in 1947, was the follow-up to Williams' 1944 debut.Its melodramatic structure, however, is never allowed to eclipse the emotional and atmospheric authenticity of the play. It is particularly revered for its multi-faceted characterizations; its rich dialogue, which is masterful in its lyricism as well as its use of working-class vernacular; The play recounts Blanche's efforts to adapt to her new circumstances with her dignity and sanity intact, and documents her poignant attempts to conceal her advancing age, her professional failure and her highly sexual nature from those who might judge her harshly."
dvd,,5.0,"Beautiful, heartbreaking, heartwarming treat for the soul.","Braving what had to be enormously difficult conditions, the film-makers have done such a wonderful job of capturing the life of these incredible animals.  Their lives are filled with amazing tenderness, courage, fortitude and valor....something we could all aspire too.  I highly recommend this film for viewers of all ages and hope it starts a dialog about saving not only these creatures, but our planet at large in every home it's seen"
dvd,,5.0,Take a sick twisted ride into the urban nightlife!,"Im sure all of you have seen the show atleast once and if you havent then let me explain it. The whole purpose of this show is to show you all of the wild and crazy people out there in the urban nightlife with your drunken, comedic host Dave Attell. It is easily my most favorite show after South Park! If you want to have some good mindless fun then buy this quickly"
dvd,,5.0,A compassionate  feel-good love story ,"This wonderful 1998 Swedish story is about love and friendship, captures compassion and is laced with humor.  It takes place in the 50's.  One important fact about this movie was that the casting of characters was superb, and that is what makes a good movie, the characters.   "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Film #1 in Park's Vengeance Trilogy,"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is the first film in Chan-Wook Park's phenomenal vengeance trilogy.  Park's trilogy is in the same vein as Kieslowski's famous Trois Couleurs trilogy, but where Keislowski explored a world of beauty and love, Park explores a world of pain and revenge.  In this first film, the plot is intricate and entertaining, the acting is excellent, and the mood of the film is gripping.  Events unfold in a way similar to a classic tragedy, as if fate conspires for the eventual downfall of the story's protagonists.  I would definitely recommend this film, as well as the other two in the trilogy (Oldboy, and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance).  Unlike most trilogies, it doesn't really matter what order these are watched in as they are mostly unrelated to each other.  While Oldboy is by far my favorite of these films (and by far the most violent) its extraordinary quality doesn't by any means diminish the quality of this film, or of Lady Vengeance.  If you are a fan of hardcore asian cinema (in the vein of Takashi Miike), do yourself a favor and check this series out."
dvd,,5.0,A Classic Movie of All Time,"This is the best movie, the movie has everything murder, twists, great acting.Barbara Stanwyck plays her best roll ever, so does Fred McMurray,great extra features also GET IT !!!Worth Every Cen"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,the best noir film,"i saw chinatown when a friend of mine loaned it to me saying i might like it. at first, the film was getting boring but then when faye dunaway came onto screen the movie just then catapulted into another ball field and i was hooked. nicholson and dunaway bring vivid performences but i felt dunaway was the real star. her character, evelyn mulray, brings true life into the picture and without her i may have turned off the movie. the film tells of jake gitties who is employed by a woman named evelyn mulray to spy on her cheating husband and in the process gets in way over his head as he discovers a huge plot when mr. mulray suddenly turns up dead. with this fist cracking screenplay, excellent music score, and eye schorching cinamatography, chinatown is flat out a great film. a must for you dvd fanatics"
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,AMAZING!!!! I LOVE IT!,I REALY LOVE THIS MOVIE IT'S JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE (MAYBE EVEN BETTER).
dvd,5 of 8,4.0,Is it porn or just sex,"I have to admit, the story line of the movie the first time I watched it totally escaped me. It seemed to be a gradual build up of moderate sex scenes to completely explicit sex scenes and not much in between except for some noise which is passed off as music."
dvd,22 of 22,4.0,Great Start!,"I was totally new to Pilates when I purchased this video, but have now been doing Pilates quite seriously for a couple of months.  This video hooked me.   I like Moira Stott's style and method of giving instruction.  I still use some of the warm-up moves she gives to demonstrate the basic principles of PIlates.  Pilates is a very different kind of exercise than anything I had done before -- with its emphasis on control and precision as opposed to either ""throwing your body around"" or high-reps.  The moves are deceptively difficult to do well, so  this short workout with not too many moves (and with some modifications to make them more approachable) is a very good idea -- I think it is a good way to see if this form of exercise is for you.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Air force One,"Harrison Ford and Wendy Crewson are believable in this action/human story of what happens when the presidents plane is hijacked. The real story however is about how hard it is to hold to ones principles when doing so means the death of a loved one. It is a quality, action movie"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Real Friendship,"This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era."
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,What happens when meat eaters switch to sugar,"I'm tired of films in which everything is spelled out. Some great twist is revealed right on cue at the very end, and we're all supposed to reel in shocking surprise. The relationships in Never Cry Wolf are communicated with near silence. The audience sees the bonds strengthen rather than simply be told it. This is a quiet film with as many twists and turns as a typical thriller, and it pays off."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Uncensored, ninety-minutes long, and commercial-free Family Guy at its best.","""Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin - The Untold Story"" is a wonderful/hilarious movie that centers around the very popular and animated Griffin family.  Any fan of the television show will undoubtedly appreciate this movie because not only does it involve the usual antics of the show, but also gives the fans ninety-minutes of non-commercial entertainment.  The jokes are riskier than those of the television show, the story goes a little more in depth, and it is just a longer version of what Family Guy fans enjoy already on television.  If you are a fan of Family Guy, then you definitely owe it to yourself to purchase this film and watch it.  "
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,a strange and wonderful film ,"While working in a video store more than ten years ago I came across this movie. Nine out of ten people I tell about it haven't heard of it. It has been my little secret.. and treasure, as I consider it to be in that ever-so-small category of truly unique films. The story concerns a down-and-out silent era director, (Dreyfuss) that, unable to deal with the transition to talkies, has withdrawn into a reclusive life, never leaving his Hollywood mansion where he makes pornos for the gangster Big Mac(Bob Hoskins). Even though he knows what he is making, he still applies the director's art to it, taking a meticulous approach to every shot. The sense of doom is palpable- in fact his house is slated for demolition to make way for a new freeway. The whole thing is very theatrical-- all the action takes place in a continuous scene and on one set. The acting is a bit stagey, which fits the subject matter. All of the characters have cartoonish names (Ms. Cake, Big Mac, Rex the Wonder Dog) and for the most part equally cartoonish personalities. Dreyfuss is a drunk genius surrounded by half-wits and low-lifes. Whenever (and it is often) their chatter threatens to drive him mad he busts out with another ever-funnier one-liner. It's an effective portrait of creative brilliance performing and yet wasted in a petty, narcissistic theater. This is the Boy Wonder: desperately using creativity to buffer himself, minute-by-minute, from the madness threatening to close in on him from every side. You get the sense this trajectory started much earlier, in his successful period, and he's been backed into the last corner, trying to stay shooting by managing this small group of freakish guests in his house. "
dvd,,4.0,Supernatural Forces Dominate Windowless Mansion,"Director John Hough masterfully presents the screen version of Richard Matheson's novel ""Hell House"" with a perfect cast to bring the ghost tale to terrifying life. The Belasco house sits ominously in the mist, foreboding, dark, and with no light save for occasional sun rays."
dvd,,5.0,The Best of Billy Bob,This is a one of a kind movie. The only way to know that Billy Bob Thornton is in the movie is  because his name is in the credits! All the characters were great and made the people seem real; plus the music was so good I bought the Soundtrack
dvd,1 of 1,1.0,Stealth...,"Terrible is movie this a.  Read that first sentence if you can.  The movie is about as good as the grammar I used.  It combined many bad actors from many bad movies to combine in a wonderful exercise in...[nothing].  The plot is just completely ridiculous and unorganized.  I won't even get into it.  If you want some specific details on how bad it is check out the review above me.  I would recommend this movie to you, but it is terrible.."

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,The Best of Grover,"  Like Gonzo, Cookie Monster and Herry, Grover is a lovable, furry blue monster. Everybody likes him except Fat Blue, the man who Grover always sells stuff to. It shows all the great things Grover has done and all the things he did as Super Grover. I like the fact that Kermit was in this. They ARE best friends. The Best of Grover is a great video!"

dvd,7 of 7,5.0,The Little Ways They Tried Together Made History,"This DVD is a valuable piece of Broadway history, as it documents the process involved in recording one of the landmark cast albums of all time, ""Company"". It is interesting to see the mechanics involved, naturally, but what sticks with you is the determination of these tired actors (they recorded on the Sunday after opening night, their day off) to get a permanent record of this brilliant, groundbreaking musical. It's fun to watch them subtly interact as if on stage."
dvd,9 of 15,1.0,Where is the breakdown?,"I was so excited for my Groovaloos DVD to come, but I was very disappointed. The dancers take 5x more effort showing off then actually teaching steps. There is no step breakdown, no counting, no different views. They basically do the dance 1 time at a medium pace and expect you to just catch on from there. I watched it twice and decided to throw it in the junk box"
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,excellent transfer,"I could tell immediately on viewing the first few minutes of this release that it would be the best I have seen of the movie, by far. A decade ago I watched the laserdisc version on a Pioneer 50"" set, and now this DVD on a Samsung HD LCD. The increase in detail and beauty of the color is fantastic. The incredible sets are all the more impressive. I hadn't seen the director's version before... the lack of narration is a plus. The movie has finally been done justice for home viewing"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you probably won't see anything like it  again","Eventually, anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories. First, you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter, and probing into the nature of evil. Sometimes, they go the supernatural route (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now). Sometimes, they stay grounded (Psycho, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Se7en). Either way, they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening. You acknowledge that what you've seen has struck a kind of nerve, but you won't lose much sleep. These movies are  intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror."

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,My favorite!,"I've been Netflixing exercise DVDs to decide which ones I want to actually buy, and I knew from the first time I watched this one that it was going to be one of the keepers.  It's fun!  Well, mostly -- the beginning is difficult (hmmm... how many squats/""plies"" can I do in rapid succession before my thighs, hips, or knees give out on me?), but I still actually look forward to this routine.  It seems to lean more toward the dance-type moves than just exercises, even more than the (admittedly few) other Pilates DVDs I've seen.  Also, she doesn't make you do so many of any one given exercise that you get bored -- or she adds moves or changes the routine slightly, so you feel like you're doing a different exercise (which you kind of are).  And the clincher, of course -- it's having an effect on my weight & muscle tone.  The instructor is a pleasure -- very likable, and her movements are very graceful.  I just wish she'd release some more DVDs"
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,"Ice Cold, Hot Wired!","Gone in 60 Seconds is a guilty pleasure - its vacuous and superficial, full of typical Hollywood produced ""guy-movie"" cues. Cars, guns, explosions, anti-heros, and Angelina Jolie abound, as well as comically evil villains, comically thin plot devices, and comically honourable car thieves. All that being said, though, the movie is great for what it is - a typical Bruckheimer celebration of over-the-top action. Its fun to get lost in the action, and director Dominic Sena imparts a great sense of pace (which he failed to carry over into 2001's Swordfish), keeping the tension level-high, the action front & centre, and the cars at full throttle. There's also some real funny moments too - the ""Brick House"" rendition at the police impound lot makes me laugh every time."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Outstanding,Greate standup. For the price is just excelent you get a dvd and a cd. Pablo is hilarious and his impretions are probably the best thing on the dvd. If you don't like comedians that use a lot of profanity then probably this isn't for you. Great Buy
dvd,41 of 46,4.0,Sophmore Slump,"This 2nd season has its moments but isn't as fresh or wild as the 1st season.  It's good to see the debut and origin story of The Chicken Lady and see more episodes featuring the Headcrusher.  Contained in this collection are classics like ""Daddy Drank"" and The Trappers"".  There's a lot more miss than hit.  I would recommend this to completists.  I give it 4 stars because a so-so episode of KITH is better than other ""good"" sketch comedy shows."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,A Great Johnny Depp Movie!,"This movie is one of my favorite movies.  It is funny, sad, poignant and oh so romantic. The theme song by Brian Adams (Have you ever really loved a woman) adds to the romance of it all.  This is a great chick flick but I know lots of guys who like it too!"

dvd,3 of 4,5.0,The Good Earth,A B/W Film Classic.
dvd,13 of 13,5.0,A great one,"More often than not anime tends to be extremely repetitive. A young guy fights his way to the top whether it be in sports, outer space or love. It's even worse when the show goes on for far longer than it should. You get 150 spisodes into it and the main character is still doing the same thing he was doing 20 episodes into it. Granted, this show is not some revolutionary genre buster but it is definitely refreshing and engaging."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,I love this movie,"This is a really great movie. I have been waiting forever for it to come out on DVD. Devito is really good in this role. I love the way that he carries his character. A very big man in very little shoes. Peck and Miller are also a pleasure to watch in their supporting roles. And Devito's ""Buggy Whip"" speech in the proxy fight is fantastic. It's similar to Douglas's ""Greed"" speech in Wall Street in that it is an uncomfortable truth, but the truth none-the-less. I very happy that this finally came out"

dvd,73 of 74,4.0,Odds are we won't leave this island alive,It would be nearly impossible to trump the first Jurassic Park film.  People were blown away by that movie.  The technology was cutting edge and the premise was nearly magical in its element of fantasy.  Making a third installment to the series presents an obvious challenge.  How do you uphold the level of entertainment set by the first two films?  The answer: new dinosaurs...
dvd,2 of 4,4.0,MATADOR was a first-class FLOP!,"Brosnan has certainly stepped down from his 007 roles - he's very bad in MATADOR, both literally and figuratively.    Despite what other critics have said, I found his performance to be only mediocre.   The character portrayed, Julian Noble, is a sleaze who suddenly, but strangely, develops a conscience after years of killing people for a living.  He meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in a hotel bar, and tries, very stiltedly, to form a friendship.  As an assassin, Noble hasn't really had many of those over the years.   "

dvd,4 of 5,1.0,Only for Jim,"The film has a realy bad picture & sound this thing made watching the movie and I'm bored, This star only for Jim Carrey not fot the movie"
dvd,3 of 5,4.0,Holds up amazingly well,"  I really liked this version more than the modern remake in some ways. The sketchiness of the effects served to make them more frightening, actually; more potential for collateral damage. In an odd way the Martians, with their frighening but alos less precise weapons were strangely intimate villains, like humans in their lack of precision.  Except for the occasionally shreiky heroine and the sappy religiosity, this movie was a good show.  The director took time to actualy make characters out of the characters, so everyone had a personality. They also painted a broad picture of the wohle world under attack, not just America, and there was something poignant about the way nations were depicted as handing off information at great risk to themselves.

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Ashtanga Basics,"This DVD was a bit less than I had expected.  I have been taking an Ashtanga Yoga class and wanted to practice the full series at home, so I bought this DVD.  It does a great job going over the basics, just as it says in the title.  Had I realized, I probably would have purchased the second in the series.  If you haven't taken an Ashtanga class, but are familiar with yoga, I would definitely recommend starting with this DVD."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,The Legacy Of Chris Farley Lives On,"Chris Farley is a martyr to the comedy world. He was the best drag queen ever, and he was not afraid to fall down. It's a shame that he was succumbed to a drug overdose on December 18, 1997 and was found dead in his apartment. Do yourself a favor and don't do drugs. They f**k you up. Also donate to the Chris Farley Foundation, which is run by Farley's two brothers. Comedy is good for you, drugs aren't. "
dvd,7 of 10,5.0,mission impossible tv series, 
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,At the Top,"Fellinis's Roma is the director's fanciful excursion into auto-biographical self-indulgence on a magical higher level.  Filmed after his psychedelic ""Satyricon"", Fellini extends his series of dream-inspired visual classics.  Make no mistake, at age 50, Fellini still had it.  ""Fellini Roma"" is a plotless, visceral delight.  It is perfect.  From scenes of the Rome subway to Musolini's Fascist dynasty, ""Fellinis Roma"" encompases scenes from the director's life in 1931 up until the hippie onslaught around 1972.  It doesn't make sense. It isn't supposed to. It's great art. It's eye candy.  I'm going to put on the DVD again"

"
dvd,2 of 9,1.0,Prejudice movie!,"This movie is NOT good for the kids! It teaches them how to be prejudice and will probably result in them hating cats! Cats are actually really sweet animals, like the complete opposite of what's shown in the movie. People, you shouldn't get this for your kids unless you want to teach them prejudism."
dvd,,5.0,Great Concert Footage and Music,"Haven't seen this since it was in the theaters almost 20 years ago. This is an excellent concert DVD. The documentary footage is the usual rockumentary stuff, going to Graceland and seeing Elvis's grave and talking deeply about the meaning of the music (which the band actually mocks and laughs about doing). But the music and seeing U2 in their prime as this monolithic juggernaut of musical talent, charisma and stage performance is just magical. The music is great and Bono is the air apparent to the thrown of Savior of Rock and Roll. He is THE MAN. One highlight that was not actual concert footage is them working with B.B. King. Also love the beginning, ""Charles Manson stole this song from the Beatles... we're stealin' it back,"" as an intro for Helter Skelter. The first half is in black and white for all the new songs that they were introducing. Then when they get to most of their big hits in the second half it is in color"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,U2's Best Live DVD Since ZooTV,"  From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs.

dvd,10 of 10,5.0,NOW I get it!,"I was fortunate to see this play during it's Broadway run. While it was brilliantly acted, directed and was able to add one chilling element the film can't (the onstage audience in the elevated gallery, always looking like a silent jury)at times I had trouble following when we were seeing a flashback, an inner dialogue, or plot development. (The physics in the play is quite well presented but trust me, don't have that second tequilla shot before the curtain, no matter what!You really have to be on the ball for this one.) However, now having seen the film twice, many things come clear. The magic of film allows the players to think private thoughts without us mistaking them for side comments being made under the breath. Also, it is very clear when we are listening to the ghosts and the live players. But what REALLY gave me an ah-ha moment was when I finally saw that the play is crafted to mimic the act of nuclear fission. Instead of a neutron colliding with and splitting an atom into several directions, setting off a chain reaction, we witness two brilliant physicists colliding, also under forced circumstances and the split is represented by the various possible outcomes of that collision. We view several versions of the same encounter, each with different implications and motives. I can't wait to see this again and see where bells &quot;ding&quot; for me this time. The score is haunting and adds a great deal, as solo piano is unsurpassed in evoking a sense of isolation and loneliness.  Acting is uniformly solid. I know I'll get lambasted for this, but I really preferred this cast over the b'way cast, especially Steven Rea, who added just a touch of melancholy to the role that I don't remember in the original. Give it a try. You may come away with the uneasy feeling that in a roundabout way, these men may have saved our planet"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great Music,"This video is one to have.  I watch my son's face light up every time I put his video on.  I, myself, enjoy listening to the music and watching the characters dance with such rhythm.  My son is 10 months old and is a serious fan of the dancing, color, and music.  I believe the older he gets it will definitely help him with his imagination, and teach him to play and share with others.  If you haven't seen their show, tune in to Nick Jr. and you'll be impressed like I am"

If you  want cutting instructions there are some but, nothing that will help a novice overmuch..My rating this is an overpriced bit of nothing"
dvd,12 of 12,4.0,"""IN THE RANKS OF DEATH...""","""Three Days of Destiny"" is a good docu-drama covering the battle of Gettysburg, where over 50,000 Union and Confederate Soldiers were killed, wounded, and captured or missing. Despite some miscasting (Longstreet wasn't chubby OR going bald; Lee, too, wasn't fat) and some over-dramatized voiceovers, this film features some spectacular battle scenes filmed at the Gettysburg 140th Anniversary Reenactment, and a stirring soundtrack. Historians will find it to be an enjoyable docu-drama, while others may find it unsatisfying. Nevertheless, it is a fine film that belongs in the DVD library of any historian. Movie/DVD Grade: B+"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,"Simply, Dream Theater","The best way to describe Dream Theater is to watch them play live. I have seen Dream Theater live when they came to Monterrey, Mexico, and I was amazed by the talent these musicians have.

The story of a 9th Century son of a Roman king who seeks to find the meaning in his life is as casual as a troupe of travelling medieval entertainers, yet as entertaining as it's Broadway rock contemporaries; Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair, and even Rent. Great early '70's rock music with a heap of soul, (The Jackson 5 had a hit with Corner Of The Sky in 1972), and outstanding musical comedy performances by Tony winner Ben Vereen as the godlike omnipresent lead player, Chita Rivera as Pippin's scheming sex-brained mother, and Benjamin Rayson as the warring king.

Although she is not seizure free, we have noticed about a 65% decrease in her overall seizure activity. She used to have 12-25 ""drop"" [atonic]seizures a day, with almost constant ""pulsing, bucking, rythmic activity' [myoclonus] Since the diet she is down to 1-2 ""drops' and almost no myoclonic activity. This movie paints a very realistic picture of the lives effected by this disorder. Although I never had to get on a plane against medical advice to take my child far away for treatment, I have had to literally SCREAM at the doctors and advocate for my childs best interests. We have been fortunate enough to have found a child neurology clinic 12 miles from home where they readily offer the diet as treatment, and our particular doctor [who we had to wait 2 years to see due to the red-tape of insurance companies [[[don't even get me started!!]]]] has already started to wean her off of the 3 aeds she is currently on. This diet is very labor intensive and strict, and I can't say that is has been a picnic, but the truth is that it IS worth a try. It is helping us tremendously even though is has also been a source of severe stress. "

I had bought this tape from a video store because it was a previously viewed tape they were selling for a really inexpensive price and since I did enjoy another Pauley Shore movie I decided to buy the previously viewed Jury Duty tape but when I watched it I was very disappointed, I was so bored and barely made it to the end! I gave the tape away to a relative who liked the movie so it wasn't a total waste of money"
dvd,,5.0,Beautiful,"This film is a beautiful break from the often superficial plots that dominate many of today's films. The story is of the Emperor Penguins and their touching life cycle. You see them struggle for life, in the freezing conditions, and watch them suffer the heartache the way many humans do. The film is beautifully shot, and very emotional. Considering the conditions the film crew did a magnificent job. This film is timeless and appropriate for all ages. I watched it with my family on Christmas Day and we were all almost in tears. At the end you reazlie that we all share that common element; we would do anything for our family. It's one of the few DVDs that I own"

On the surface the story is the tale of Edward Scissorhands, created by inventor Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles. ""Edward Scissorhands"" could have been another story completely, a horror story, or science fiction, or a comedy. Instead, Tim Burton creates a beautiful fairy tale set in an idealized suburbia of the 50s."

dvd,8 of 8,4.0,"Great movie, single disc DVD not as great","In my opinion, this is the best of the Eastwood-Leone westerns. No point in going over the content, as other reviewers have already done so.  Unfortunately, the single disc DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so if you have a 16x9 set, the image won't fill the screen.  There is a 2-disk British edition available from Amazon UK (or EBay)which is far better than this one: it's enhanced for widescreen TVs, the picture and sound have been restored and cleaned up, there's a commentary and some featurettes (and it gets 5 stars).  If your DVD player can play Region 2 discs, THAT'S the version to have.  We were supposed to get this in the USA in fall 2005, but after Sony bought the MGM film library, they dropped it from their fall releases and I've heard of no plans to release it, or ""Fistful of Dollars"" or ""Fistful of Dynamite,"" all of which received similar upgrades.  Let's hope Sony changes their mind about that. "

It was way before its time content wise.   When i was a kid, it was the car that made the show. Today, when i watch these episodes in season 3 , or any other season, i catch myself being caught up in the stories.  Of course Kitt is still the main attraction, but each episode had a great storyline.  I don't rate one season higher than another, but season 3 has many MANY memorable episodes"

She sings alongs, quotes Archimedes, wants to go out and find Merlin (we live in Bermuda) and just can't get enough.  I heartily recommend it to all those with children, and who are young at heart. "

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,I thought Hostage was good!,"I thought Hostage was an entertaining thriller, and you can't beat ben foster's death scene.  one of the best death scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Serious Science Fiction Shocker,Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Interesting Character Study From the 70's,"""The King of Marvin Gardens"" is an example of why the seventies was such a golden period in American filmmaking in that studios as well as stars would take a chance on offbeat material regardless of it's box office potential.  Director Bob Rafelson creates a haunting story of disparate souls who cling to hopes that are as faded as the Atlantic City facade they inhabit.  Jack Nicholson effectively plays against type as a radio personality who joins up with his brother(Bruce Dern) to partake in his latest get-rich-quick scheme that has all the earmarks of going up in flames.  They are joined by Ellen Burstyn as a faded beauty queen who's along for the ride in the futile hope of attaining a dream.  This film is not easy to watch at times but the more ambitious viewer can appreciate filmmaking that dares to challenge it's audience.  Gorgeous cinematography of the Atlantic City landscape before the casinos were erected."
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,I didn't like it.,"I'm not sure what this movie was about.  It had all of the hollywood cliches such as a nude shower scene, the older astronaut dies tragically, one astronaut turns on the other and murders him, there's man eating bugs, a murderous robot, and a star trek style fight scene where he outsmarts a robot with his ingenuity.  Its ironic that the guy is saved by a russian spacecraft since american movies always make fun of Russians even though they've put more astronauts in space than we ever have been able to."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Wonderful tool - Had my system tuned up under an hour,The tools on the CD are easy to navigate and the tones and patterns were extremely helpful in fixing some out of phase errors and channel balancing. I was suprised about how much better my system sounded after using these tools. Well worth the $$.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Satirical Look at a Dangerous Time in History,The background realism in this movie perfectly balances many wonderfully comedic and absurd happenings in the foreground.  Peter Seller's comedic genius really shines through.  The documentaries included in this set are all very good.  I particullarly liked the one about Kubrick.  The conversation with Robert Macnamara was very enlightening
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Very Funny,"These guys are a terrific comedy team.  I'm guessing this movie wasn't a big hit; otherwise I would expect Wayans and Sadler to work together again.  Although this is a comedy, it's quite violent.  The body count is higher than in most Clint Eastwood westerns"
dvd,7 of 10,5.0,Great DVD Treatment of One of Billy Wilder's Greatest Films!,"The super deluxe 2-disc DVD edition of the 1944 film noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (DI) rocks!  Director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, it even improves on the book.  The dark tone and scandalous subject matter freaked out Hollywood so much that it took 9 years to get DI from the printed page to the big screen.  Fred MacMurray was the only leading man in Hollywood with the guts to take the role of insurance salesman-turned-murderer Walter Neff, though even MacMurray needed convincing at first.  None of the other in-demand male stars of the period wanted Barbara Stanwyck's conniving, money-loving, hubby-offing temptress Phyllis Dietrichson to make a chump out of him.  Their loss!  (I'd first seen MacMurray when I was a kid.  Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY.  MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!)  "
dvd,21 of 36,1.0,Useful fools,"In their heyday, Marxists used to call people who, while not being Marxists themselves, defended Marxism ""Useful Fools"". It seems this is a common phenomenon even today, since I see people defending an obvious (I did see the COMMERCIAL) commercial for Wall Mart, surely paid (indirectly?) by Wall Mart itself. Yes folks, this commercial, just like the Fed Ex commercial (that many people including me paid to see) Cast Away should fool no one (but unfortunately it does). This is even more suspicious that those ""experts"" that give world wide tours (without charging!, which proves they are being paid for their propaganda by ""unknown"" sources) DENYING the existence of subliminal messages (why would someone bother denying that?). If you want to be a useful fool go ahead and buy this (hey I did buy this to see the ""other side"" of the debate but this is not it, and I was suckered) if not, better go and observe a real Wall Mart yourself (a sad experience to be sure)"
dvd,0 of 9,5.0,Well...,"There was a ton of hoopla over this movie, and I just don't get it."
dvd,,5.0,Ease of acquiring hard to find item.,The product was quickly delivered in excellent condition. Amazon com makes it easy to find items for purchase and the purchasing process is very well done
dvd,4 of 7,1.0,Not Cesar yet paired with Cesar Millan TV Show DVD,I searched out Cezar Millan and got his TV show and it was paired with this DVD.  The author was only listed ad Dog Wisperer.  Very disapointed at Amazon for this type of pairing.
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,And now Ritchie Vaelns' life story ,"First we had The Buddy Holly Story, and now we have La Bamba, that is Ritichie Valens' own life story, and in the Buddy Holly Story we had Gary Busey doing his own singing, in this movie, Lou Diamond Philips doesn't do his own singing, instead it is a band named Los Lobos. And plus we get some more out of this story then the buddy Holly Story, okay we know that Ritchie Valens was another one of the singers that lost his life in the plane crash on the morning of Febuary 3rd, but how much else do we know about him, since his carrier was only 8 months long? La Bamba opens with some boys playing basketball in a school yard, and in the sky are 2 plans, that crash, and guess where they fall. Yep, that is rgith to the schoolyard below, we later learn that one of Ritchie Valens' best friends was killed on this day, and that we are too believe that this is his memory. We also learn that he was not present that day, and he believes that if he was, he would have been killed by one of the falling planes. Hence, why he didn't like to fly. Ritchie Valens (Lou Diamond Phillips) grows as a poor boy out in the middle of Calfiorna, he lives with his Mom Connie Valenzuela (Rosana De Soto) , and one day when working out in the fields he sees his troubled half brother Bob Morales (Esai Morales) coming out hsi motorcycle, and goes off a ride. And then find Connie, and they also introuce a freind of his mom name Rosie (Elizabeth Pena) to Bob. They movie out, and into a trailer, and 3 months later Connie leaves for her job as a waitress. And he heads off to school, where a new girl named Donna (Danielle von Zerneck) is new to town, and to the school, and is in one of his classes with Ritchie. The rest you should get of his beginning of his carrier, where he treys out for a garbage band, makes it, but at the first gig the lead singer (Geoffrey Rivas) doesn't even let him sing, which leads Ritchie to tour around town solo, and envtelally with the band minus the lead singer, when then he is spoted by the man that would be become his manger and his name is Bob Keene (Joe Pantoliano), which leads to his school days being over, and Ritchie still dating Donna, even if her parents, weel at least her father doesn't approve of Ritchie and the music that he plays.

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"Buddhism at the Mall - the ""real"" EVERYTHING store of your desires","This has become one of my favorite movies of late. Will I always love it? Not sure, but for now its the sort of film that I can watch and watch again. Many other reviewers have noted that much of the interest of the film is intellectual, in fact that the comedy, however sophmoric from one perspective, depends upon an intelectual underpinning that is probably not shared by most viewers. And I agree. Trust me, there is much more than the surface farce going on here. I would note that many of the other reviewers seem over focused on Existentialism as a philosophical school. I think this is taking the notion of ""existential detective"" too narrowly. In fact, the greatest philosophical influence in the film seems to me to be Buddhism, which the director has a long involvement with. I once recommended the film to a fellow teacher as a textbook intro to Zen. The on-going tension between the affirmative vision of totality and the nihilistic vision captures a Zen motif, as does the ""sudden enlgihtenment"" of the balloon scene. I could go one in great detail. Nor do I think that the film is simply making fun of intellectuals or philosophical seekers; it is far more subtle than that. Suffice it to say that for me the film is powerfully moving, even uplifting, at the same time that it acknowledges the ""manure of human existance"". I doubt that the real difference between those who ""get it"" and those who hate it is intellectual per se ( a number of ""students of philosophy"" posting here hated the film). Its more a matter of one's sense of life, one's attitude towards it: a passion for the depths, for complex thought, and at the same time a joy in the simple, including the simple truth of one's own limitations. Not a film for those too serious to see their own absurdity, nor for those uninterested in taking the time to look beyond the absurd to the serious"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A Banana Split Worth of Quantum!,"If you loved ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" you will love ""What the Bleep Down the Rabbit Hole."" All your favorite academic types appear, with more indept talk about Quantum theory. The expansiveness of the mind and the capacity of creating our own reality plus the challenge of otherness, parallel universes is the dose of what is possible I welcome. I watch either DVD at least monthly. The description of addiction, and how this traps us is another lecture I welcome. The capacity to see life as what I shape it, what I bring to the experience from a consciousness in expanded reality,what I can create is thrilling, and I feel this possibility after viewing either DVD."
dvd,15 of 16,4.0,Should have been an added bonus to the movie DVD,"Should have been an added bonus to the movie DVD, not a seperate DVD.  Not really worth buying as it is almost the identical dialogue from the movie, except in black and white.  This original short is interesting, maybe worth renting, but I think it should have been put on the movie's DVD as a bonus feature.."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Insomnia WILL NOT put you to sleep!!," Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" is a fantastic film, that manages to top the original. This police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end. Al Pacino has one of his best roles in years.(He's still the man!) Robin Williams was better in ""One Hour Photo"", but he's not glaringly miscast as others claim.The rest of the cast is first-rate, with Hillary Swank being particularly good. The credit for this film's greatness belongs to Director Nolan. He's created a tense,visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches, and stands as one of the best movies of the decade. "
dvd,3 of 21,2.0,"Boring, dull, pointless",Here's a brief synopsis:
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Sleeping Beauty Awakens!,"This DVD changed my opinion of Disney's Sleeping Beauty.  Since the story has been summarized elsewhere, my review will focus mainly on the DVD itself.  I had never been much of a fan previously and viewed this as a sort of Snow White and Cinderella also-ran, although I did love the gorgeous, sweeping adaption of Tchaikovsky's ballet, with ""I wonder"" and especially ""Once Upon a Dream"" being among Disney's finest and most transportative musical pieces.  The difference between this and prior releases of Sleeping Beauty (indeed, of many Disney movies) is that the digital restoration truly enhances the film possibly beyond what, as one reviewer put it, may actually have been experienced by the original theatrical audience."
dvd,,4.0,Great workout ,"I have been using the tape for a week now. I do both cardio segments and the sculpting one. After just a week I can fit into clothes I bought 4 years ago that I havent been able to fit into. I would give it 5 stars but on my CD the bootcamp segment doesnt work, it takes you thru the warmup and then I get a black screen and it goes back to the main menu. It does it on the custom workout and the 6 week program. I dont want to send it back though because of the price and results I am getting so far. Other then that I highly recommend this video for a great workout and results."

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Epic movie that gets better year after year,They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  
dvd,2 of 10,1.0,calling this the worst horror movie is kind,this is movie is A NICE BIG PILE OF WARM DOO DOO.THERE NOTHING ENTERTAINING ABOUT THIS FILM HORRIBLE ACTING AND SERIOUS OVER ACTING ARE JUST THE BEGINNING TO THIS MESS.NO STORY TO BE FOUND SUPER BAD SPECIAL FX .I MEAN U CAN SEE RAW MEAT TOSS ABOUT AND THE NEW GUINEA ZOMBIES LOOK LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS U FIND IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA.AND ADDING STOCK FOOTAGE IS PLAN LAZY.I DON'T KNOW IF THE PERSON WHO DIRECTED THIS STILL ALIVE IF HE IS HE SHOULD BE MADE TO WORK AT MCDONALD'S MAKING FRIES FOR LIF
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,One of the Best Movies I've Seen In a Long Time,"Many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the United States.  To this, I respond: We've seen that hundreds of times in films.  The same goes for sports films.  We've seen the movie Glory Road in other films like Coach Carter, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers.  They are exactly the same movie with a different team.  That's not to say that these films aren't decent sports flicks, but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genre."

dvd,1 of 8,1.0,The only death here is by boredom!,"'Let's Scare Jessica To Death' is one of those tricky '70s horror flicks that many of us 30 & 40-year olds recall seing bits & pieces of, could never quite recall the name, and remember as being very scary. I'm one of those viewers, and decided to give it another watching, now that I can appreciate film better than when I was a kid. Sadly, 'Jessica' is a horror film better left to the hazy corners of the memory."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Wonderful edition of The Kid,"This MK2 edition of The Kid has to be the best available. Beautiful picture quality and great extras, the best in my opinion being another silent starring Jackie: My Boy (1921), which I like as much as The Kid (despite its being completely silent, even devoid of a musical score). All in all, a great package and worth every cent of its price"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The Inner Voice of Paul Thomas Anderson,"In Dogville Vs. Hollywood I wrote a single line on Magnolia, calling it ""a sprawling, only partly successful imitation of Altman, [that] suggested Anderson was a filmmaker with aspirations possibly beyond his talents."" Having seen the film for second time, seven years later, I have some serious crow to eat. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Barbie dancers is awesome.... ,"Great good hearted family fun for children, I love the ballet Barbies the best.... much better than Mermadia and Fairytopia.... MUCH!  My kids love it, they sing these songs over and over..."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,One of the best Concerts !!!,"This is one of those DVDs you can start, sit back and don't stand up until it ends. I love it ! At the first part of the concert, just as in the Concert for Bagladesh, there's an indian music section directed by Shankar's daughter (Nora Jones Sister). Before I see this part I tought it could be boring but it isn't. It is wonderful."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Great for all dog lovers!,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this movie. I'll admit, though, that I had low expectations because most kids' movies are ridiculous. I hadn't expected to sit and watch it with my child, but I found myself pulled in through this whole movie from the beginning all the way through till the very last great line of the movie. It may seem like a copy of other movies in certain ways, but it is so well done, funny, sweet and poignant.  And the little boy who stars in it does a wonderful job.  A great ""feel good"" movie for dog lovers especially!"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,A Joyous Celebration (despite the secrets),"Mira Nair produced a film which is very entertaining, magical, and realistic in how it portrays the stresses and experiences associated with planning a modern wedding in India. The bride is a college educated beauty who has some liberated ideas and behaviors  ... but she is also the the only daughter of her parents, a child of her culture. She agrees to an arranged marriage to the handsome son of a friend of the family... after a failed love affair (first secret in the film) from which she is not yet fully recovered. Aditi feels ready for marriage, so she tells her unmarried female cousin Ria who has some doubts about the matter. The unique traditions of the past are combined with modern touches - the past and present intertwine in unexpected ways to produce a beautiful and creative collage of whacky entertainment. The street scenes filmed in New Delhi symbolically represent the chaotic atmosphere, tensions and pressures of the preparations for a wedding. The plans are to create a joyous celebration ... to be remembered by both families ...and cherished for a lifetime. Family arrived from America, Dubai, and Australia ... to celebrate the blessed union of two young people in marriage."
dvd,,4.0,Not as good as part 2 but still great,What can you say. This film really enthused a new generation of B-movie filmmakers. It's part of my generation and means as much to me as citizen cane meant to you know.....old people
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,30 Helens Agree ....,"The Kids in the Hall was that comedy troupe for those wanting something a bit more realistic and adult than ""Saturday Night Live"", while also catering to that audience that felt that ""the State"" was a bit too overwhelming.  So, The Kids in the Hall found the niche, and they exploited it in the most original and entertaining way possible.  The created skits that not just reflected the absurdities of everyday life, but also released some of the most vivid characters ever to cross the small screen.  Scott Thompson, Kevin McDonald, Dave Foley, Mark McKinney, and Bruce McCulloch created some of the funniest bits of comedy and on just their first season out.  "
dvd,,2.0,Not representative of Dishwalla quality,I read the comments about the editing before I bought but it still didn't prepare me for how BAD the editing on it was.  I swear it was edited by a junior high media class on the last day before summer break.  I'd be really interested in how/why the band or their management let this one get put on the streets.  Camera angles were also limited.

dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Outstanding Hip-Hop Documentary,"This is a really excellent film and it is no suprise to me that it has won so many awards are various film festivals.  The film is about ""freestyle.""  Freestyle is a form of rap music that comes from the top of the MC's head.  A freestyle is not a written rap.  The MC that ""fronts"" a written rap as a freestyle loses much respect.  The film maker has amassed a great deal of archive and olf footage of hip-hop legends like Cool Herc and Run DMC to name a few.  The film is really about the underground culture.  Unless you are deep into underground hip-hop, you are not going to recognize a lot of the rappers in this film. I can't say enough about this film.  It explores the various aspects of the freestyle art form--including ""the battle.""  The battle is when the MC's go at it in a freestyle battle.  They can say some really confrontational things, but it's all about the rhyme.  Women rappers are also well represented in this film.  Bahamadia appears in the film as does rapper Medusa.  All hip-hop lovers should check out this film.  Between the live performances and the interviews, you will know about the freestyle culture by the time you finish watching this film.  It digs deep into the rawness of hip-hop and rhyme.  No bling bling, video chicks and or Bently's, just cats freestyling"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,SPEACHLESS,"MAN,ive been waiting on this for years.IT's the best thing to happen to gospel music in years.It's because of COMMISSIONED that i got saved.It was great to see the guys together on stage again.You can feel the electricity from the concert.I'll nver forget the first time I heard them in the early 80s.I've never been the same.I've been blessed from the first song I heard(Hide the word),to (I AM HERE),to my all time favorite(KING OF GLORY).I'll end tis by saying,I never thought the guys would ever come to my city,but they did,and I had the chance to play host to FRED&amp; MARVIN.The result.For almost 9 years we've been friends.

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Shawn Michaels Story,This is a very good dvd. First ill will review this entire dvd then i will give my idea for another shawn michaels dvd spanning his entire career.
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,Nostalgic.,"From the opening performance, I had fond memories as a child of Marvin Gaye being featured on American Bandstand. The difference between then and now is that the sound is coming from a good state of the art stereo system rather than a small TV speaker, and so I did not realize how good these performances sound. They, in fact, sound like a well recorded record with stereo separation and all. Additionally, while viewing this DVD, I concluded that Marvin Gaye sounded better in the beginning of his career than at the end of it. In the beginning, he was clean shaven, polished and formal. Surprisingly, I have grown to appreciate what Berry Gordy was trying to do for these young Motown artists in the beginning of their career. The music here is great and timeless, and a joy to listen to after so many years. Get this one even if you have to hitch hike to the store to get it. :-"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Friendly Persuasion,I was so glad to find this movie on DVD.  It has always been one of my favorite movies.  Now I can be confident that I have the movie in a format that will last a loooooong time
dvd,4 of 10,4.0,I saw her dance in Carnegie Hall!," I saw Elsa Leandros perform with Bobby Farrah in Carnegie Hall many years ago. She looked great on that stage performing both flamenco and belly dancing. It was quite a surprise that she came out, after all this years, with a DVD. I tried taking classes with her, back when I lived in New York city, but they were too hard for me at the time. Her DVD is really good. I had no idea she could also do those other styles. In my opinion, however, I wish she'd just stuck to bellydancing for this DVD."
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,Another Great Film from Park,"If you're reading this, odds are that you've seen some of Park Chan-Wook's other films, particularly 'Oldboy'.  Suffice to say, if you liked 'Oldboy' I can't imagine why you wouldn't like 'Lady Vengeance' as well, nor do I believe that this movie will convert you if you aren't already a fan.  A few people will try and tell you that this is actually quite different from Park's last film, but I really don't know where they get this conclusion. 'Lady Vengeance' has unusual, stylish and artfully composed shots, surrealist inserts, skewed chronology and storytelling, themes of revenge, loss, family and reunification and an unpredictable mix of abrupt violence, black humor and surprising pathos.  In short, it has all the stylistic trademarks that defined 'Oldboy'.  It does, as the film moves along, eventually venture into more purely bleak pastures somewhat reminiscent of 'Sympathy...' in tone, but overall it still reminds far more of it's direct predecessor than of that other film.  Arguably, it isn't much of a step forward from `Oldboy' in terms of style or content, but few people can pull off a film like this the way that Park can, so he's allowed to spin his wheels a bit if he so desires."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Just right,"I really enjoy these videos.  The teachers are personable and not intimidating.  The pace is a little slower than some, but I find it very doable, even when I don't really feel like exercising.  The variety in this collection is great.  I've taken classes in yoga for a year, but found that I really needed to do something daily, not just once a week, and this set is perfect for just that. "
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,If you think you've seen it before...,"...you have. This film has been compared to ""Logan's Run"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Coma"", to name a few, but it most strongly resembles 1979 B movie ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"", probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mock-a-thon ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Sitting through ""The Island"", I kept thinking to myself ""Boy, this looks familiar."" In fact, ""The Island"" is almost a complete, play-by-play clone (ba da ching!) of ""Parts"", right down to the outfits worn by the clones. There is currently a lawsuit against Bay brought by the makers of ""Parts"", which should be an open-and-shut case. "
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,A movie worth watching,"A very good romantic comedy, Kate & Leopold, brings to the screen the story of a 19th century down-on-his-luck English nobleman who travels to NY in search of an American bride who can help him pay his debts.  Things get a bit complicated when on the night of his engagement he enters a portal and ends up in up modern NY..."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,A Holiday Classic,Mickey's Christmas carol was a childhood favourite of mine and I have been searching for it for years.  Now that I have found it I am extremely pleased with it.  It's just as I remembered.  On top of Mickey's Christmas carol are two other classics that will bring joy and Christmas spirit to anyone.  I definitely give this movie 5 stars
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Unersappreciated,"Yes, this is one of the last of the MGM musicals. Tis a pity.  Now that CHICAGO is such a hit, they must release other MGM musicals just as good as this.  THE BAND WAGON...THREE LITTLE WORDS...EASTER PARADE and SUMMER STOCK, just to name a few.  SILK STOCKINGS is a remarkablly good film for it's genre.  Nothing could beat CYD and FRED dancing, even if the plot isn't strong.  Too bad there wasn't more of JANIS PAGE as one of her numbers seems to have been given the short shift.  Otherwise, the film is a standout and a must for musical lovers.  Any left?  I think so.  Give this one a try as well as the other Cole Porter releases.  Thanks for these, but we want more!!"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Keaton meets Arbuckle,"This 2-disc set compilation contains 12 ( including Buster's debut in "" The butcher boy ""  ) of the 15 two-reels comedies that both comics interpreted together ( only one, "" A country hero "" ( 1917 ), is lost ), all of them directed between 1917 and 1919 by Roscoe "" Fatty "" Arbuckle himself ( there are only doubts with "" Coney Island "" that some specialists authorize entirely to Walter Lang ). Fatty's conception of comedy was pretty superfluous and mechanical ( just inversely that his friend Buster ), based on easy misunderstandings and jokes and the humorous explotation of his enormous body . However, the three last comedies of the couple Arbuckle-Keaton  ( that not accidentally coincide with a progressive higher protagonism of Buster so much as actor as gagman and who one year later would direct his own comedy shorts for producer Joseph M. Schenck too ), specially ""Back Stage"" and ""The garage "", are fine constructed slapsticks with a good comedy timing and clever comic situations. The twelve shorts in this compilation are in chronological order: ""The butcher boy"" ( 1917 ); ""The rough house"" ( 1917 ); ""His wedding night"" ( 1917 ); ""Oh, doctor"" ( 1917 ); ""Coney Island"" ( 1917 ); ""Out west"" ( 1918 ); ""The bellboy"" ( 1918 ); ""Moonshine"" ( 1918 ); ""Good night, nurse"" ( 1918 ); ""Back stage"" ( 1919 ); ""The hayseed"" ( 1919 ) and ""The garage"" ( 1919 ).The copies of all them are fine, as well as the piano accompaniment by Neil Brand. The DVD includes a brochure by Jeffrey Vance, co-author with Eleanor Keaton ( the third and last Buster's wife) of ""Buster Keaton remembered""."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,I had chills through the entire  performance!  ,"This is one the BEST performances of Aida that I have ever heard.  The singers are the best, the set is absolutely the MOST BEAUTIFUL  I have ever seen.  It is a top quality performance given in a 350-seat opera house and it works!  Missing is the ballet and the actual witnessing of the triumphal prossession which happens behind the singers.  However, the performance is so marvelous that this small omission doesn't matter. This is a recording that every opera lover should have in their collection; I have never enjoyed Aida more."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,it works,"This dvd/ball set is great.  For once, something I have tried for  back tension works exactly as it claims.  The idea is simple...learning to feel your tension helps you release it.  Yes, this particular dvd only deals with the lower back and hips, but it CLEARLY STATES THAT FACT on the back cover.  Excellent product"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Multi-layered film that demands serious consideration,"In Mamoru Oshii's outstanding Ghost in the Shell (1995), the director/writer gave himself little time, at less than 90 minutes, to explore the many questions he raised in that script.  With his long-awaited sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, he succeeds in answering many of these questions whilst at the same time giving us many more to ponder, in a film that, though flawed, deserves a 5 star rating."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,new sound,"uh, i believe this HAS the restored musical sound track, in spite of what one reviewer says"
dvd,9 of 12,5.0,"so cool, love Leisa Hart, love the old ""STEEL"" videos","Leisa Hart is my favorite instructor, and it's so cool to have two of her old ""STEEL"" videos put onto one DVD. Hart's cueing is so good, and her style of teaching is very comforting. I love most of the Buns of Steel videos, but the ones lead by Leisa Hart are truly the best. This is a great dvd and is well worth it. 2 thumbs up!!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,GREAT PRIMUS DVD/EP COMBO! CAN'T BEAT THIS PRICE EITHER!,"...  Ok... I reviewed another album by Les Claypool (highball with the devil) and mentioned that it was an album that every Primus fan should have.  I also mentioned that Primus tends to be a band you either LOVE or absolutely HATE.  I love Primus.  I respect the amazing musicianship of Les Claypool and have trouble understanding why other people can't see things my way, but... Can still respect their views... It's not their fault they're idiots (just kidding...)  But... This is the definative collection of Primus videos (and home videos), in addition to a handy-dandy EP of Primus songs by the original members.  That should say about everything a Primus fan needs to know..."
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,all i can say is SARAH THOMPSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this film is a wasteland, but if you look at is strictly for entertainment value, it kept me entertained.  Too bad the plot had the twist that made no sense and ended the film 35 minutes too soon(I think they ran out of budget).  Sarah Thompson is certianly prettier then Reese was in the original.  Good entertianment, at least for men"
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,YU YU meets La Femme Nakita: VERY VIOLENT,"""Director Ichiro Itano presents a hellish vision of the afterlife in the brutal horror anime series GANTZ. High school student Kei and his childhood friend Kato are helping a hobo who has fallen onto the subway tracks when they are run over and violently decapitated by an oncoming train in a spectacularly grisly fashion. Transported to a strange post-death limbo, the pair find themselves in a barren room overlooking Tokyo with a motley group of strangers--including two hotheaded gangsters and a naked young girl, whom they immediately try to rape--as well as a mysterious black sphere known as Gantz. Kei and Kato soon discover that they and the room's occupants are all dead and have been brought there by Gantz as part of a secret government plot to kill criminal aliens that roam the earth--and that if they refuse their deadly missions, they face a fate even worse than death. Moody, stylish, and animated with veritable buckets of crimson blood, GANTZ plays like a twisted hybrid of YU YU HAKUSHO and LA FEMME NIKITA, with graphic violence and nudity DEEMED TOO GRAPHIC to be aired on Japanese television without major edits and re-cropping. Produced by the team behind CHRONO CRUSADE and PEACEMAKER."" "
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,Beautiful suffering,"There is something foreign, almost inhuman about this bresson film - the nearly complete lack of emotion exhibited by the characters, their hands and feet moving like autotrons. Bresson's communities are flat, colorless, barren and humorless. Still, the power this film has to generate such raw passion and deep sorrow is a mystery. You realize that you've been changed by the artistry of a master, but are at a loss to explain why or how. This film about the life and death of a donkey named Balthazar resonates deeply, and while it may very well be a Christian allegory it need not be - it does not approach you from the intellect. It may very well be a film about mans cruelty to those helpless creatures that have no free will, but then again it need not be. It is not a film that directly pulls on your heartstrings. ""Au Hasard Balthazar"" is a film that uses characters as both windows and mirrors. Through them we bear witness to man's cruelty, pride, indulgences - weaknesses. Through them our own emotions are pulled from the depths of our subconscious and then projected back at us with the force of moral clarity. Somehow we are cleansed and by watching this all too familiar human landscape of the lost, we somehow find ourselves. And so when the almost unbearable, yet strangely beautiful final scene plays out and the other worldly notes from a Schubert Sonata rain down upon us, through the suffering of this poor beast Balthazar, we are baptized"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,Feel good time,"This movie is a feel-good teenage chick flick about two friends who spend their free time enjoying the beach, studying teen magazines and giggling over Raymond, a hunky young lifeguard on whom they both have a serious crush.  But the good times are about to end for Claire (Emma Roberts) and Hailey (singer/songwriter Jojo), as Hailey will be moving to Australia in five days so her mother can take up a new job opportunity there."
dvd,14 of 23,2.0,watch out!,"be careful with this video if you have any neck, back or shoulder problems"
dvd,20 of 23,4.0,Widescreen,"I wanted to clarify something I know about Disney widescreen. Some of these features are not being offered in widescreen (ex. Pinocchio) because they were not even originally filmed in widescreen. The first Disney film to use widescreen was Sleeping Beauty, which came out in 1959. Pinocchio came out in 1940."
dvd,2 of 2,1.0,A Glorified Commercial,"This thankfully brief title cannot even be called a movie; it is a glorified ad for the ski slopes and entertainment at Club Med. It is only worth a viewing if you REALLY have to see a young Jim Carrey doing good impersonations of Steve Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. singing Mr. Bo Jangles. And if you want to see what Get Smart's Hymie the Robot has been up to! Otherwise, you would have to be a fan of skiing championships or the musical performers (see other reviewer's comments for musicians' names; I forget who they are) that dominate this overlong commercial"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,I enjoyed this movie when it was released and it is still as enjoyable as then.  The actors and the simple plot were great
dvd,37 of 38,5.0,MUCH better than expected,"After reading the reviews I thought the DVD was going to be horrible, but it's actually pretty good, and so far one of the best instructional hip-hop videos I've seen (I own a Groovaloos DVD and Tina Landon DVD and have used Darrin's Dance Grooves), and the instruction is also better than some teachers I've taken classes from.  "
dvd,25 of 30,2.0,Sometimes it's best just to let the past go...,"By this point it ought to be blatantly obvious that the recent reviews are for the 8 disc Sams Club edition for under $20.  But, just for the record, that's the copy that I'm reviewing as well."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,SOLDIER,I really loved this story! Each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,My favorite movie kiss,"I was a teenager in the 80's, so I love all of the old 80's teen movies, but Some Kind of Wonderful makes my top three. The performances were believable - the actors became the characters, not the other way around. Eric Stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who wants to pursue art instead of business. Mary Stuart Masterson is his best friend, a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him. Lea Thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty - and her boyfriend. Craig Scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend - and the only off note. "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,What a Great Series,"Murder, She Wrote, was one of the all time best series on TV.  I was so pleased to find the 1st Season on DVD, and have since purchased the 2nd & 3rd Season.  So nice to watch a series with NO sex, and foul language. I love Angela Lansbury, this was one of her best"
dvd,4 of 6,4.0,Fairly Deluxe Edition of a Musical Classic ,"""Guys and Dolls"" is a fairly faithful, good adaptation of the great Broadway stage musical. Unlike ""West Side Story"" or ""My Fair Lady"", it isn't a film that cries out ""SPECIAL EDITION!"" but it is fine to have one available."
dvd,2 of 2,2.0,I should've read the reviews before renting it,"7 Seconds is a formulaic capper that's not entertaining at all. The car chases are ok, but nothing to write home about. It's a regular Snipes movie, but lacking fun. It's long, illogical (which isnt bad if it's entertaining),  and just plain boring"
dvd,9 of 42,5.0,Another Vote For Colorization! HOORAY!!!,"Let's face it...color is natural...black and white isn't. There is no such thing as ""Glorious Black & White"" when it comes to film. As has been stated before, they used it in the early days because that was all they had, and later because color was too expensive, and was used mostly for the big ""epics"" like GONE WITH"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A look into the life of a cyborg,This movie is a keen look into what happens when the earth becomes ridden with strange plagues and murderous thieves that for some reason love to sport chainmail.  The main plot is that some bionic cyborg chick has to get this cure to atlanta to save the world from the plague.  She about gets ruined by a chainmail sporting murderous thief named fender and his merry henchmen.  She only about gets ruined because Van Damme comes and saves her.  Van Damme in this movie wields a sword which is pretty cool considering it's the future and they should have phasers or spazers or lazers or something to the effect.  Old school just works best sometimes. So they get away and then van damn starts having all these punisher like(the comic not that god awful movie) flashbacks where a gang kills his family.  The gang just happens to be fender the chainmail sporting murderous thiefs gang which is also the gang that was curently pursueing them.  How ironic!  So later they meet up with this hot chick who you see naked when she gos to bath in the ocean.  Wowzers!!!!   Van Damme gets all close with her and stuff and then he gets crucified and finds his daughter is in fender the chainmail sporting murderous thiefs gang.  So Van Damme gets all determined and go's and gets all strong and go's to fight fender the chainmail sporting murderous thief.  What happens then?!?!? You'll have to watch to find out.  I am a cyborg so I really appriciate this flick.  It's a good view into the life of your everyday bionic cyborg.  Ah...how I miss the days when I was human
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Comedy for male and female viewers,"The Wedding Crashers is one of the modern breed of rom-coms (along with Hitch) that actually appeals to men as well as women. The formula is simple, amuse the guys by showing the male lead as a chauvenistic womaniser, then please the chicks by having him turn into the gushing romantic hero who falls for the female star. It basically means juvenile toilet humour for the first half of the film before the transition into unrealistic gushing soppy romance that never actually happens in real life in the second half. I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit sappy towards the end"

Go rent it - no, scratch that - buy it now!","Right off, this endearing indie about a train-watching dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who unexpectedly inherits an isolated train station in the boonies of New Jersey deserves every single award it won at Sundance and every morsel of praise I can heap on it."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Hidalgo,"Love this movie, caught some of it on TV one week so then did a search on Amazon and brought the movie. Family entertainment Loosly based on the real life Frank T Hopkins who did more to save the wild Mustang than any other"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,The sense of the past,"One of the most intellectually complex of all the films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, ""The Archers,"" A CANTERBURY TALE was intended to boost morale during the war concerning British and American relations during the preparations for the D-Day invasion of the continent. Three modern pilgrims on their way to Canterbury and its environs--a self-assured ""Land Girl,"" a cynical cinema organist now serving in the army, and a clever and folksy American GI--attempt to solve a bizarre local mystery in the Kentish town of Chillingbourne: the identity of the enigmatic ""Glue Man"" who keeps pouring glue into the hair of local women after dusk.  The film is much more than a mystery, and as the DVD commentary by Ian Christie and the accompanying textual materials in this lovely Criterion release make clear, it is so much more indeed it becomes almost unclassifiable. It is a comedy, particularly in the charming bits with the local children. Like all of Michael Powell's films, it is also a romance involving sexual hysteria. Above all it is a pastoral meditation on the status of England and its heritage at a truly crucial time in its history, and it asserts both the discontinuities with the agrarian past and the need to reconnect with it during a troubled time of modernity. The ""aw shucks"" demeanour of the Oregon GI (John Sweet) can take some getting used to, but Sheila Sim is really extraordinary as the Land Girl, and Dennis Portman is also quite fine as the local squire who becomes central to the trio's investigations. The tremendous closing sequence of the film involving the organ of the Canterbury Cathedral is one of the most striking evocations of the sublime in the history of film"
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Awesome Entertainment,This movie was very entertaining.  It had several messages which proved to be both interesting and helpful.  It is also a powerful story which depicts how things have a way of coming together when we work as a team in spite of our differences.  I'm sure I will be showing this over and over again with my family and friends. 
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,Beautifully done,An interesting glimpse into a culture that knows how to live with death as part of life. Beautifully and sensitively filmed. I definitely recommend it.
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Wonderful,I am not a movie buff but I enjoyed the movie as it was superbly entertaining.  I even watched the scenes that were cut from the movie and appreciated that the director took the time to do so.  He explored many avenues and hit the nail on the head with his chosen direction and we are all the better entertained for it.  I love history as well and got a kick out of the historic references.  The tender friendship stories with black faces was comforting to see
dvd,,4.0,Alien v Predator v Humans (w/out sex),"Until Alien v Predator, the best human/alien interaction was Danny Glover's encounter with the alien/hunter in Predator 2. It was a down to Earth (no pun intended) face off between the hunter and the hunted. But humans are predatory by nature... we love the hunt, the kill, the challenge. The aliens never stood a chance."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Amazon.com did it!!,I bought this for my niece who has fallen in love with the Backyardigans (and so has her Auntie).  I was having a hard time finding DVD's in the retail stores.  Amazon is the only place I have discovered that has as many DVD's as they do.  Thanks!  My niece loves it and her Auntie is #1 in her book now
dvd,,5.0,AWESOME!!!,"I love the show and all the characters and actors. It has the right amount of scifi to wow you, and the right amount of drama to keep you watching!! Jacqueline McKenzie is a wonderful actress in this. She hides her aussie accent very well. Joel Gretsch and the other actors are also really good in it"
dvd,,4.0,Nicely Done,"Well, done, wide ranging, long.  I bought this for my high school digital photography class, however, and it isn't suitable for that."
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,thank you,"I just received this set yesterday so I haven't yet had a chance to watch any of the dvds, but I wanted to thank Amazon and Warners for showing some consideration for the real fans and making this upgrade box available.  Too often these days those of us who buy cds and dvds when they are first released are being screwed over when, some months later, they decide to release a new, expanded edition with extra material.  We can either do without or we can duplicate the purchase.  Because of this I now find myself hesitating before buying new releases.  That is why I am so appreciative of this set.  Those of us who bought the first Fred and Ginger box last year now have the opportunity to upgrade the packaging of the first set to match the new releases and get the new extra features and all for about the same price as we would pay just for the second box set.  When too many companies could care less about keeping the customer happy we should all be thankful when we are shown this much consideration.  So, once again thank you"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Into Glory thru Blood & Steel!,Usually movies based on historically facts are plagued with inaccuracies. Fortunately this is not the case!
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"""Beef"" Review","Hip-hop's most infamous feuds (on and off wax) are explored in great detail in this entertaining documentary. Such battles as Tupac vs. Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre vs. Eazy-E, Nas vs. Jay-Z, 50 Cent vs. Ja Rule, and Westside Connection vs. Common are chronicled. There's a lot of interesting information on here including an in-depth investigation of the infamous Hit Factory incident involving 50 and Murder Inc. Tru Life reflects on some poor choices he made involving his feud with Mobb Deep (complete with a rather intriguing robbery story). You'll also get to see the infamous golf club incident involving Nate Dogg and Gangsta Dre'sta (of Ruthless Records). If you're even the mildest hip-hop fan, ""Beef"" is a very entertaining documentary"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Beautiful !!!!,This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing! The acting is superb! the cinematography is just flawless!It's too bad we can't make a film this touching and poignant in the USA. I tip my hat to War-Kar Wai
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,       Poor Henry Fonda didn't know what hit him ....twice.,"  He is Charlie Pike, the fabulously wealthy heir to a brewery fortune. He's returning on a cruise ship from a year in the Amazon studying snakes. It's been a year & he is in need of some female companionship. He hooks up with two grifters, Col. Harrington & his very sexy daughter Jean played by Barbara Stanwyck, who is by the way is at the top of her game. They decide to shake down poor, innocent Charlie for all he is worth. As expected he falls desparately in love with Jean. Unfortunately she falls in love with him & now doesn't want to take him. Their love scenes are hot & very suggestive for censorship Hollywood of the time. He finds out she is a card cheat & drops her & pretty much erases her from his memory. She vows revenge. The action shifts to the Pike estate. A family friend is visiting & brings along his niece fresh from England, Lady Eve. It is Jean thinly disguised with a British accent. Charlie doesn't have a clue. According to Jean's/Eve's plan he falls in love all over again. Things progress & eventually they marry. They leave for their honeymoon. While in their sleeper on a train, Eve decides to spring her trap on the guileless Charlie. She messes with him, spinning a tale of her past designed to shrink any man, if you get my drift. Of course it all works out in the end. It is a screwball comedy with all the twists turns & misunderstandings. If you've seen one you will recognize this as a Preston Stuges movie from the very first of many pratfalls that Henry Fonda takes, with help from his sidekick played by William Demarest, a Sturges regular. Sturges  takes a serious social issue, such as class structure, then ridicules it. He then sticks slapstick in his movies, for big laughs, in case somone misses the subtle satire. Fonda does his usual fine job & Stanwyck is really hot. Their chemistry especially in the early shipboard scenes really works."
dvd,9 of 11,5.0,Highly enjoy it,"I enjoy this anime not because it has the ""Final Fantasy name"""
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,A milestone Noir!,"This anthological Noir remains as one the most ambitious exponents of this genre. It 's by itself a kaleidoscopic vision about the human condition `s miseries. Greed, ambition, murder, betrayal and double moral carried until its last consequences. The inspiration belonged to James Cain but the superb approach of Tay Garret, the towering performance of John Garfield and the alluring presence of the captivating Lana Turner in that unforgettable first plane that constitutes his first appearance on the screen still remains as one the most supreme erotic moments in the story of the Cinema."
dvd,10 of 15,2.0,"If you want old-time sesame street, this isn't it","I bought this tape after reading the reviews.  I am looking for Sesame Street videos that are good for our daughter but also will keep our attention, since we always sit down with her to watch.  We are big Muppet Show fans and also grew up with Sesame Street.  I was not getting this tape to teach my 18-month-old to read, but some educational content is desirable.  If you are expecting something like the Muppet Show, you will be disappointed, although the bits with Prairie Dawn and Benny Rabbit begin to approach it.  The rest was rather flat, although I will admit my expectations were high for this video.  There are only two ""old"" sketches, and the ""fat cat sat on the mat"" with Mahna Mahna and three other muppets is marred by the addition of flashy animated words that are not well-timed to match what's being said on the screen.  It doesn't bother me that the words ""taught"" in this video are so random, ""sticky"" and ""slippery"" with ""I"" and ""at"" and ""go;"" the lack of entertainment value for adults is the bigger flaw in my estimation, as is the absence of more excellent older sketches from Sesame Street.  Muppet Show fans, do yourselves a favor and get some of the 45 available episodes of the original Muppet Show"

dvd,,5.0,Defining a generation?,`Clueless' is probably the equivalent of `The Breakfast Club' for the 90's generation.  I went to school with these kids; sadly...I was one of these kids.  `Clueless' is also one of the smartest comedies to come out in the 90's for it capitalized on everything that made teenagers of that era funny and stupid.  The 90's was a much easier time.  Now we have films like `thirteen' (probably the best film to come out in 2003) to describe life as a teenager...life today is just so much darker than I remember it growing up.

Now he is 2 years and 2 weeks old and can recognize EVERY letter in the alphabet AND say the corresponding phonetic sound. I am amazed at how quickly he picked it up. We are a bilingual family (English and Thai/Lao) and  thus far in his life he hasn't been extremely ""verbal"" yet (he walked at 10 months and is great with all the physical stunts, but so far doesn't have a very large vocabulary)."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Great movie!,There are so many funny moments in this movie by the end you will still be laughing about them all. I first saw this movie when I was ten. I only understood the slapstick humor. When I watched it again when I was thirteen it was triple the hilarity!

dvd,9 of 11,5.0,"Thrilled to find ""Inserts"" on DVD","     When this movie was first released in theaters, radio advertisements for it described it as ""a shocking and decadent X-rated film"".  It briefly raised a furor, as did most of the early feature-length X-Rated films of this era.  In retrospect, this was misleading advertising, because ""Inserts"" is much more than just an X-rated film.  This movie qualifies as a genuine artistic expression in the league of major motion picture production, and it's far above the norm in terms of plot, dialogue and acting."

dvd,3 of 16,5.0,The way it was ment to be., This trilogy is great. I wished I got this when it first came out. This trilogy DVD box set is worth every penny you put in to it. It's like watching the todays Star Wars movies!!!!!!!!!!!!
dvd,,5.0,The BEST show on NBC,Medium has been my favorite tv show for a couple years. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD. What I like most about the show is that is also focuses on Allison's family and not just her job. It makes it so seem real. The kids in the show do a great job
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,POWERFUL AND FITTING ADAPTATION,"The studio brass finally got it right when they let Joseph Wambaugh write and supervise the production of his (then most) powerful non-fiction masterwork.  THE ONION FIELD is one of 1979's best films and it's brutality, both socially and judicially, is stunning.  Harold Becker was the right director for this labor of love, an ""A lister"" at the time would have screwed it up and the film's intensity would have been lost under the  hype. The acting is the core of THE ONION FIELD: James Woods was robbed of an Oscar nod.  John Savage plays his heart out as the tortured Carl Hettinger and Ronny Cox is solid as Pierce R. Brooks (Brooks later wrote OFFICER DOWN CODE 3, which is a staple in any police library).  Christopher Lloyd has a small important role as The Jailhouse Lawyer.  This was justice for Wambaugh after his studio war over THE CHOIRBOYS (1977).  Put this one in the win column."

dvd,,4.0,Adam's Best!,"Of all the Adam Sandler movies I've seen, this is my favorite. (I'll admit that ""Little Nicky"" was a close second.) There are lots of great gags throughout the movie and as long as you keep in mind that the plot is just there to string the gags together you'll find that this movie is quite enjoyable! I'm sure that in the writing process the gags sprang from the plot, but the plot is definately not the strength of this movie. There are many ridiculous twists in the story that in retrospect are just plain stupid, but there's so much funny stuff going on that you hardly notice. If you're looking for something funny, this movie delivers"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Beasties still have the skillz to pay the billz,"First, let me start by saying this: if you're not already a fan of the Beastie Boys, this DVD is not going to convert you. Usually, that kind of statement is a cop-out reserved for defending a poor live performance, but in this case, it simply is what it is. If you're one of those people who either A) doesn't like hip-hop, or B) doesn't like ""doo-doo rhymes"" (elaborately constructed rhymes consisting of ridiculous non-sequiturs, Dada surrealism, and absurdist goofiness delivered for the sole purpose of putting a big, stupid grin on your face), you are never going to like the Beastie Boys...ever. And when you see the manic energy of both the crowd and the boys themselves, as well as the reciprocal love, you're simply going to wonder what all of the fuss is about. I'm not about to give you any of that ""You have to see them live"" business that die-hards will often trot out to defend lackluster albums. Seeing them live won't change anything. You either like the Beasties or you don't. Period. End of discussion. "

dvd,,5.0,good movie,Al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate A murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it. He has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner. He creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer (robin williams) did it. Very good movie
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Intelligent  Anime,"The series has superb animation with an impressive score plus it doesn't dumb down the complex sci-fi story.  Like FLCL or Paranoia Agent, this anime strikes a balance between intense fighting and character development all the while assuming the viewer doesn't need to be spoon-fed the plot. I like Bleach & Naruto but they tend to follow the DBZ meets Inuyasha formula where battles last 4-5 episodes.  Fans of ShojoBeat and ROD will enjoy as well. "
dvd,1 of 4,1.0,Yeesh!,"Honestly, guys, just because you think it's a stupid action movie doesn't mean you have to give it FIVE STARS!  What's up with that?  Every kill is shot in slow-mo from fifteen different angles.  That is not good direction by any stretch of the imagination for anyone with a shred of critical faculty.  Van Damme is like three feet tall, with an accent more syrupy than a chain of waffle houses (to paraphrase Mike Nelson)  He does not deserve to be enriched, complimented, or even *tolerated*.  Even Hollywood is catching on to this."

dvd,,2.0,Reporting from Location,"In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""**** all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic."
dvd,,5.0,Love It,"I've read some reviews on here saying this movie is ""so political correct it makes me sick"", and I can't help but hope they got REALLY sick, because this movie is an amazing example of excellent film making.  It is not supposed to be (regardless of marketing) a laugh-out-loud comedy like Meet the Fockers, or even a romantic comedy. It is wonderfully genre ambigous.  And the family is not being ""judgemental"" toward Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) but protective of their brother (albiet in a semi-mean way).  Listen to the director/writer's commentary and you will realize the movie turned out exactly how he wanted it to, which automatically makes it successful.  For someone to not like a movie doesn't make it bad.  I LOVE it! I guess I should only recommend this film to anyone who has at least half a brain, otherwise you could end up writing an ignorant and ugly review"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Great film,"I picked this up from Hollywood video, noticing ""SUNDANCE"" across the cover. It is a very interesting movie. I may not have seen all of the director's other work, as many of the other reviewers, but having picked this off the shelf by chance, I think I am as qualified as any to say that ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" is an excellent film. It is a thoroughly entertaining, interesting and thought-provoking film about people. Four people end up chatting for hours over wine at a bistro. The viewer does not know their particular relationships to one another, and in the beginning of the movie, little flashes from the characters' lives are thrown in. I thought the beginning was a bit too much information for a viewer, but it sorted out in the end as the characters' lives unfolded to each other and the viewer. It was an excellent movie, I highly recommend it"

dvd,7 of 11,5.0,A new twist on Art History,"I'll be perfectly honest, I had no idea who Modigliani was before this DVD came in to my hands. I've always been a fan of art history, although I've never taken any classes on it, I've always just pickde up things here and there and appreciated art. I was captivated by Modigliani from the very beginning. I found everything about the plot interesting and fast moving. "
dvd,2 of 8,1.0,"Story was good, acting good, singing??? What singing?","Sorry, if one is casting for a MUSICAL movie, one should actually cast actors who can SING, not just actors who have big names. Sophia Loren couldn't carry a tune to save her life."

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,The darkest of comedies brilliantly presented in glorious film-noir style!,This review is for the 2002 Universal DVD.
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Screwball Comedy with a Woody Twist,"Tucci, one of my favorite (and I think most underrated) actors, does a fine job emulating the styles of Woody Allen and Frank Capra in this homage to the madcap comedies of the 30's.  The brisk pacing, snappy dialogue and exaggerated characters make the film a treat."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Stand by Me,"When listening to Rob Reiner's commentary on the tragic story of what happened to River Phoenix, one can't help but be moved by the final scenes of this seminal 80's movie. I was a late teenager when I saw this and it clicked perfectly with memories of when I was a kid and had a bunch of buddies that did the normal kid stuff--going camping, riding bikes, getting terrorized by older kids!!!!  Anyway, I know I wasn't around during the time period this is set, but the basic themes are universal. Now I'm not going to bore you with a recap of the story--you can read that in another review. Let me just say that the four leads are incredibly natural and give fine performances, even Jerry O'Connell whose first film this is. And of course Kiefer Sutherland is wonderfully menacing !! (No  wonder he was a vampire in Lost Boys the next year!) I'm not sure the steady stream of profanity was necessary but then again, I wasn't around during the 50's so maybe that was par for the course. As someone elswhere mentioned, this is an adults kid movie. The dvd extras are fine--it's great to see the cast and director and Stephen King remark on the making of the film. Knowing this was King's favorite adaptation of his work really makes this more affecting. So relive those fun times as a kid if you have seen this before and watch it again. Especially if your an old timer like me--you know, all of 40 years old. And if you haven't seen it before--well, let me just say not to eat any pie before watching it!!!  See ya!! "
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,Michael Flatley's Life Story And His Accomplishments,"Michael Flatley sits back comfortably and tells about his life's experiences. It's very informative! He seems very honest and straightforward. He shows clips of how he started out his dancing career with the Chieftains. He tells how Moya Doherty, producer of Riverdance, approached him about doing Irish Tap Dancing during a 7-minute intermission at the 1994 Eurovision. (Michael already had an image in his head about a line of dancers across the stage all doing Irish tap) Well, it came true; the dance was a success and the rest they say is history. That is when his career, officially as a dancer, really started. He became very successful; more so when he left ""Riverdance"". "

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Mismarketed?,"Taking a look at the DVD case for this, you read a whole different text than what this movie actually is.

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Excellent Choice,"Pilates is great for strengthening your core, and this is a good video.  Holding your ""powerhouse"" in is tricky (hard), and after taking some classes at the YMCA I get a lot more out of this video.  The breathing was hard for me to learn too.  The main reason I held back a star is because I don't believe you can get the full benefit of this Pilates video without a better understanding of how to hold your ""powerhouse.""  "

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Don't judge a boy by his Star Wars,"It's such a relief to know that Hayden Christiansen can really act, although the film is carried by the underrated Kevin Kline.  I won't re-hash the plot, because all the reviewers have done so.  I think this film was wonderfully directed and emotional without hitting everyone in the face. The only thing that's really unrealistic is that Sam, Hayden's character, turns things around a little too neatly and quickly.  Otherwise, it's a look at one man's efforts to get things done before he dies.  Also includes a nice come-uppance at the end"
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,Thoughtful movie of a beautiful book,"I did the whole thing in reverse order, saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw it the first time, it was a lovely portrayal of a family in the upheavals of Russia. I read the original book and was captivated by the theme. The story of an ideal person during the hard times is difficult to capture in a movie. A lot of the reviewers gave the movie a bad rating due to this. However, I do not give too much heed to this as I have enjoyed a number of movies that reviewers trashed. A review happens due to the circumstances of the times etc. This movie has stood the test of times. The book is more detailed about the communism and its impact on the people. It has more layers in the story than shown in the movie. "
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Love this movie,"I first saw this movie in a Theater/Film class i took at SDSU last semester. I loved it so much i had to get it. I don't understand a lot of the humor possibly because it's British and filmed in the 60's and i am only 20 years old. Anyhow, my father actually remembers seeing the film in the theaters and he liked it. Also because i saw this in a class, i got to find out some interesting things about the film and its art"
dvd,1 of 9,2.0,Could have been better. Yup.,I like the cartoons and books better than this. sorry
dvd,1 of 20,1.0,HO HO Now I Know!,"Well it looks like my question regarding why these two ""Classic Cartoon Favorites"" DVD's are being released in September has been answered! Anywhey being honest, I do own one DVD of this series and that is called ""Starring Chip N Dale"" that is because there has never been a Chip and Dale collection on DVD before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Best yet,I have season one thru season 4 and season 4 is the best of the series.  The cast has matured and so has the episodes.  Even though I had heard Johnny Depp did not really want to be there he does a great job with his character.

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Sweet, Light , Funny","I really enjoy this movie.  In fact, I've watched it more than once.  It not only is a comedy, it also has some romance and sweetness in it"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect Halloween movie...especially on video....,"I first saw this movie in the theater,and I came out shaking.It's that creepy.For a movie that is only PG-13&lacks the usual slasher&bloody gore,this is a movie that gets inside your head.(From what I've heard,the original Japanese version is even scarier)"
dvd,18 of 25,4.0,Interesting Role-Reversal,"Basically, I think the underlying premise of this movie is pretty sad - that 2 people are having a secret rendevous to escape their mundane and pathetic lives and this 'rendevous' becomes their primary source of happiness. Yet this movie is fueled by great acting along with a musical score that really compliments, and the cinematography is top notch. This unrated edition is much better than the heavily chopped edition I recently saw on cable. For any woman ever dumped by a man, this is a MUST-SEE"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"Campion is the master of quirky characters, this time in a thriller","This is a very fun film about a serial killer in NYC, who has gruesome habits.  He is caught after some surprises, which is the frame of the story.  What really makes this a worthwhile film is the actors, who are extremely colorful characters."
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,"Elmo is great-however, the ""Families"" segment needs MORE diversity!","Unlike other reviewers of this DVD, I found the lack of diversity in the ""Families"" segment of this DVD disappointing.  I realize that Sesame Street is trying to be as PC and uncontraversial as possible, but aside from one bi-racial couple and a still photograph featuring a child with two men (it is not implied in any way however that these men have an intimate relationship) all other family representations are those of the ""nuclear"" family.  I think that these representations would be confusing to children who live with grandparents, single parents or same-sex parents.  I do not feel that it accurately portrays the lives of many children today. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Exceptional,I highly recommend this version of the show.  I saw it live in SF and was delighted to catch it on PBS and now on DVD.  The singing and performances are excellent.  I have the DVD of the original as well and have heard Angela Lansbury is legendary.  While I really loved Angela Lansbury I felt Patti LuPone brought a realness to the role that was funny and entertaining and much more preferrable.  George Hearn is exceptional as well as Neil Patrick Harris.  The orechestra is fantastic and this show is as close to perfect a production as I have seen
dvd,8 of 10,5.0,"worth watching, with a sad story, based on truth",this movie is really sad. I wouldn't want to be a celebrity or a professional athlete based on what I saw on this movie. It just shows how un sympathetic coaches and the higher above can be. The girl becomes bulemic/anerexic and this happens all the time. The body can't starve. Young girls don't understand this. I felt it was a good movie to watch
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,One of the movies my Mom likes that I'll actually watch!,"I could watch this over and over again! It's so funny! The person who dissed women's manly handshakes is a sexist! But anyway, I would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch! Definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too.....for one viewing per 5 months. Don't force it on them is my advice!!"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Don't pay attention to the Amazon review for this item.,"I almost never leave a review for any item (maybe I did 1 before this), but I haven't seen a review that misrepresented the item so badly before.  The Amazon reviewer for this item says it is a disappointment.  That is not really a critical review, and, for me, is it completely untrue."
dvd,25 of 25,4.0,Very Good,"As a personal trainer I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who considers themselves inflexible, or recovery from injury.  I've tried it myself as I recent had a hamstring injury and over the years I have added a series of fitness DVDs and his is certaintly one of the best."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Have enjoyed this movie for 10 years! ,"I have watched this movie since it came out (I was only a little girl...what were my parents thinking?). Anyway, I think DeMornay does a fabulous job playing this character. The plot is simple. DeMornay is pregnant and married to a gynecologist. He kills himself due to several patients coming forward accusing him of molestation during physical exams. This causes DeMornay to lose her unborn baby. DeMornay gets herself hired as the nanny of a new baby her husband provided prenatal care for (the first woman to come forward). Her intentions are to take over Sciorra's (the mother of the new baby) children and husband. An excellent movie that I enjoy each time I watch. I always secretly wish that the movie had ended differently. Even though I am a mother now, I find myself sympathizing with DeMornay and her ordeal with losing her child in the beginning."
dvd,4 of 4,1.0,Beware of DVDs Formatted for other Countries at low prices,"I bought three DVDs(The Wood was one of them)and the DVDs were in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a ""special"" DVD player.  I'm very unhappy with my purchase.  My recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country.  This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices"

Watch it with the CD- NFL - The Power and the Glory.  Football Heaven!!! There is nothing in this DVD you won't like. Great old footage.  Only a little more John Facenda would be the only addition that would enhance this a little bit.  Don't pass this up.  Buy this and get the CD, you won't be sorry"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Classic film making on a grand scale.  A truly epic film.,"Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all.  Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the ""Ocean of Fire"" in the 1890's."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The perfect show,"I have yet to find something I can sit down and watch with my kids that comes close to Avatar.  Considering most of the programming coming from Nick and Cartoon Network deal more with crude bodily functions and unintelligent name-calling, this is a BIG breath of fresh air.  I just hope they keep up the great work and find more content that can equal this.  Great for any age, fun to watch and very entertaining with plenty of lessons about right and wrong, people and life in general.  We'll stick with the whole series!!"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Red Hot!,"In Bob Rafelson's (FIVE EASY PIECES) 1981 remake of the 1946 version of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE starring John Garfield and Lana Turner from the novel by James Cain, he made a brilliant decision in his selection of Jack Nicholson as the drifter Frank Chambers-- when he was still young enough and handsome enough to be believable as a red hot lover-- and Jessica Lange as Cora Papadakis who is married to the older Greek Nick (John Colicos) and is a fuse just waiting to be ignited; and burn she does."
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Great Quality,"Received movie pack in few days as promised. Can't believe the quality is so good for being old films.  Also,  to get 50 movies for such a small price is great.  Also, the variety of titles and actors brought back memories from when I first saw these movies years ago.  Glad I discovered Amazon.com as a great source to buy top quality media."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A wonderful film,"I wish everyone could see this movie; it is beautifully produced and anyone seeing it will be left with compassion and understanding of life in a culture unfamiliar to most Americans.  Buy it or rent it, but see it.  And let all your family members see it, especially the kids"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,What a Workout!,This Kathy is a frequent flyer in my VCR.  The workout is intense and great for all level of fitness.  I had to do this tape for several weeks before I was in good enough shape to get all the way through the Wave 3 on the second session.  It really challenges you and the moves are varied so that you are working every part of your body.  The weight lifting on the tape is also comprehensive and hits all the major muscle groups.  Definitely get this Kathy workout!
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Rory Gallagher - Live at Montreux/The Definitive Collection,"This dvd is essential for true Rory Gallagher fans.  It delivers the high energy performance that I remember from the Gallagher concerts that I witnessed.  This dvd also showcases the incredible sense of melody that Rory infused into his guitar playing.  He moved flawlessly from folk, to blues, and onto straight ahead rock while making it all look effortless.  Fans of his rendition of ""Pistol Slapper Blues"" are treated to 3 versions of the Blind Boy Fuller classic.  One thing missing is the popular closer ""Bullfrog Blues"", but that is a small inconvenience compared to the wealth of music that this collection brings forth.  It is interesting to see the various stages of the band over the 20 year span captured by this disc.  The guitar and bass dueling between Rory and Gerry McAvoy is always fun to watch for any true fan.  Highly recommended"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A good laugh for all ages!,"We saw this movie at the theater and absolutely loved it!  Tim Allen is so funny in this movie!  I have not seen the original version of this movie, but really enjoyed this film!  There are some great special effects, action scenes that your kids will split up in laughter with!  The character fits Tim Allen very well, he's kind of a scatter brained all business/attorney dad that trys to do the right thing, maybe spreading himself too thin, ultimately overlooking the ever changing needs of his growing children.  With the help of a stray dog, and unfortunate event which causes the dog and dad to reverse rolls, in the end the dog helps him to see his mis-guided ways he's losing his children.  There are some comical scenes of Tim slobbering, scratching, doing really funny dog things, sometimes infront of his court proceedings and clients, yikes!  Likewise, the dog is able to understand and communicate non-verbally with the children and mom to convince them that he is the dad.  The dad's crude behavior jeapardizes his career and the dog is in danger of being kidnapped by a crooked scientist with evil plans for the dog and his special abilities.  It's a funny movie with a great message to parents to be involved in your kids lives.  "
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,"Not as good, but still watchable...","This second sequel to ""Darkman"" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about ""Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die,"" which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one. Everyone else will be in the dark"
dvd,5 of 8,5.0,HBO is not It!!!!!!!!,"I was soooo dissapointed to hear The Comeback was well.....not coming back. I found this show Highly Entertaining. I love how you almost felt like you were watching a reality show, which I credit Lisa Kudrow and the Cast for. It never ceases to amaze me how studios determine what they are willing to stand by, HBO stood by how many seasons of the show Arliss, that nobody watched, along with Carnivale. Sex and the city was not a blockbuster either it's first season and look what that went on to become. HBO, you really got this wrong"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Say What?,"Aliens *is* one of the better sequel efforts, since we all know most sequels (with the notable exception of The Godfather Part II) are just awful, cynical dreck. But the Amazon review by Marshall Fine says it's better than the original, Alien, and I'm not sure even James Cameron, megalomaniacal director that he is, would dis Ridley Scott like that. Note that Ridley made another of the 10 or 15 best sci-fi movies ever made, Blade Runner. Cameron did made the first two Terminator movies, but just try and tell me the second one was better than the first. I dare you"

dvd,,5.0,Not a HORROR movie at all...,Read the title.  This is not a HORROR movie.  It's a love story.
dvd,28 of 29,4.0,Good collection of classic Keaton at his best !!!,"I recently bought this two-disc collection of classic Buster Keaton films and two-reel shorts from my local Hastings store and for only $ 8.00,I was suprised that it wasn't really that all bad.This collection,produced by Brentwood/BCI Eclipse,contains the following three features,two of which are classic silent features such as Keaton's 1926 masterpiece THE GENERAL and his 1927 effort COLLEGE.It also includes Keaton's third sound film made at MGM,the 1931 feature PARLOR,BEDROOM,AND BATH.But perhaps another great deal for this DVD is the inclusion of six Keaton two-reel classic shorts such as THE BOAT,THE PALEFACE,THE PLAYHOUSE (all released in 1921),THE ELECTRIC HOUSE,THE FROZEN NORTH,and COPS (all released in 1922).Picture quality on THE GENERAL is the same transfer that has appeared in the Alpha Video,Goodtimes,Delta,and Navarre DVD releases as it's presented at 18 fps rather than the normal,more fast-paced 24 fps with some appearances of grain and dirt,but doesn't affect the film.It's presented with a more appropriate,Hal Roach-esque jazzy musical score which at times doesn't reflect the action on screen,but in my opinion a better fit than a orchestral classical score on previous incarnations,remember ""Pomp and Circumstance"" ? The audio on the soundtrack isn't up all the way so you may have to turn the volume up a few notches to hear the score.COLLEGE looks okay,but it doesn't quite live up to the other films in this set as it was transferred from a 16mm print complete with newly digitally created title cards as well as an entertaining,lively,jovial piano score that accompainies the film very well.But the Kino release,which I also have,has a much better,entertaining,and fast-paced pipe organ score by John Muir is that of much-better quality and restored from original 35mm elements.Disc two's PARLOR,BEDROOM,AND BATH has so-so,but good picture quality,but since I didn't really care much for that feature that there's no reason to mention about picture quality,etc.Surprisingly enough,the transfers for the six two-reelers that are on here are that from the laserdisc releases produced by the late,great film preservationist David Shepard for Kino as it contains energetic newly-created scores by Robert Israel and the late,great organist Gaylord Carter.THE BOAT is perhaps the worst-looking film in the collection as it was nearly destroyed and almost considered lost for many years.Despite these fixtures and flaws,this set is OK for your money,but for those very,very serious about quality,the Kino and Image editions of these classics for nearly ten dollars more are the definite way to go for your library of classic comedy.Not a bad deal for serious Buster Keaton fans "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Break His Heart and I'll Break Your Face ... Memorable Line!,This was the most memorable line in the whole movie... when the tom girl in love with her best guy friend tells the popular girl to watch out! Hmmm... this should have been a signal that she was a keeper. The 80's was really captured in this movie and it signals the genres theme of teenage turmoil in a greedy decade. I'm glad the best friends ended up together. Sometimes it's true that our feelings run deep and we have no idea until a rival comes along

My daughters and I watched this movie everytime it was one the Disney channel - when it dawned on me to order it from Amazon.com I didn't tell my daughters - I made each of their favorite flavors of popcorn --- and surprised them on a rainy Friday night - my husband watched this time and said, ""So, this is what I have been missing!""   On another night when I wasn't home - he said to the girls - let's watched that ""wished"" movie. "

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Take it for what it is and enjoy! ,"I was very hesitant to see this film when it was released in theaters. I was raised with Christopher Reeve as my Superman, and that was that. I enjoyed this movie when I realized this was a new Superman and a new take on Superman. It's kind of the same mentality with ""Batman"" -vs- ""Batman Begins"" Same characters, but a whole different movie and a different concept. You can't put them together and expect to be satisfied. "

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,An A+ for the A-Team,"With season one behind them, this team made up of diverse backgrounds and talents shines in their sophomore season.  The action is more intense, the plot lines more twisted, and the emotions more heartfelt.  The writers of the series really knew how to attract the male audience through action and gun battles while drawing in the female audience through heart wrenching tales of heroism and heraldry.  This is a must buy for any person wanting an experience of a lifetime.  Hannibal is more cunning, Face is more of a philanderer, Murdoch is crazier, and Mr. T. is tougher.  It's all around an Emmy winning performance from the entire cast. "

dvd,,2.0,"contrived, implausible crime drama","""Four Brothers"" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty ""Boyz n the Hood"" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.  "
dvd,,5.0,Itinerant Kiwi,"I own quite a few yoga DVDs now, and this is my favourite. Partly because of the relaxed happy style in which it was produced, and partly because of the range of practices available. As one reviewer said, the vinyasas between poses are a bit fast for my liking, but you can always pause the DVD. The tragically/magically hips section is excellent; you will feel great afterwards. A range of people showing modifications helps. Nice garden scenery as a relaxing backdrop.If like me, you don't like too much navel gazing interfering with your yoga, this is just the right touch."
dvd,24 of 25,4.0,"Cool story, shallow ending","I give this movie four stars because Maruschka Detmers is so cute, otherwise it would only rate a three."
dvd,,4.0,Sleepy Hollow - Legend of a Movie,"The movie ""Sleepy Hollow"" is aptly named.  While its characters are based on the those depicted in Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" and the tale takes place in Sleepy Hollow, New York, the story varies greatly from the novel.  Tim Burton's approach gives a new twist to the tale, and the performances by the leading actors are remarkable.  The added features provide insight to the making of the film.  However, it is not for the faint of heart.  While the beheadings aren't over bloody due to the ""power"" of the horseman's sword, they are explicit and may not be suitable for young viewers.  Also, for anyone who is a stickler on details, while the panoramic views of the Hudson River at the beginning and end of the film are breathtaking, Sleepy Hollow is on the OTHER side of the river.  Overall I greatly enjoyed the movie and recommend the film to those who enjoy horror with a twist of ""gallows humor,"" Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,all the survivor tv series,"I am writing in regards to these tv series. They have the first season and the second, well I haven't seen all the rest of the seasons haven't came out. I am upset because they have all the other reality series out there and not all the complete survivor series. It's very frustrating. So I hope to see all the rest of the seasons come soon."
dvd,,5.0,Hal Holbrook  mesmerizes as Mark Twain,"Much as Mark Twain had to do in his life, Hal Holbrook mesmerizes audiences with his portrayal of Mark Twain, the first stand-up comic this nation has ever known."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,THIS SHOW ROCKS!,"This is a fabulous television show. It has been quite a challenge to find something my entire family can enjoy watching together -- but Avatar can keep the attention of a four-year-old girl, a twelve-year-old boy, two gen-exers, and a grandpa. The characters are well-developed, the story is well-constructed, the animation is beautiful and the martial arts sequences are choreographed beautifully. It's adventurous and thrilling but not violent or scary. And it's funny. The episodes can stand alone, but the story also follows a linear path that moves at a nice pace and doesn't drag on forever...I could drag on forever about this show...It ROCKS!"
dvd,,4.0,Enough one-liners to make anyone a drag queen!,"This film is essentially a road trip flick featuring Priscilla, a huge bus hurdling through the Australian outback with three bedecked and bedazzled drag queens inside.  Of course, the bus and the trip are symbols for the personal growth experienced by the three men along the way, but the best part of this film is really its searing one-liners.  Any film in which a man in drag says to a tough bar-broad ""why don't you light your tampon and blow your box apart because that's the only bang you're ever gonna get"" is a good one in my book.  The costumes and ""production numbers"" another the trip are a joy to behold.  Although the film waivers a bit trying too hard to be a poignant meditation on the trials and tribulations of queer folk (i.e. one of the queens is on his way to see his wife and child, the bus is painted with a blatantly anti-gay message along the trip), it never fails to entertain and keeps the pace going with ABBA and other disco favorites"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Another masterful performance by Bogart!,This review is for the 2000 Warner Brothers DVD.
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Degrassi IS realistic!,"In my opinion, Degrassi is the best & most realistic show out there. Anyone who says it's not realistic apparently doesn't know what they are talking about. I'm 16 years old...& I can relate to EVERYTHING that happens on the show. In respone to another review, the idea of Terri being an overweight model is not telling us that it's morally right to be obese. It's telling us that we should be comfortable with our weight, not feel like we are worthless, which Terri experiences in the show. The show isn't boring just because the teens are getting caught in everything...they take ritalin, they get caught. It's supposed to teach us that when we do these things, we'll probably get caught...so DON'T do them. That's it. Normal teens can relate to everything in this show...these are everyday things that happen a lot...you just don't know about them. I can tell you, in my high school, I hear basically everyday abot someone either drinking, doing drugs, or having sex...so anyone who says it isn't realistic doesn't know what they're talking about"
dvd,,4.0,I Definitely Have to Watch It Again,"If you've heard of L'Avventura than you've probably heard people say that this film is about nothing. This is true...Nothing happens in this movie. Two movies kept popping into my head during my viewing of L'Avventura and they were ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""The Passenger."" The latter was directed by this films writer/director Michelangelo Antonioni. Picnic at Hanging Rock and L'Avventura have a similar event take place with a similar outcome. The Passenger and L'Avventura share the same sluggish pace that will turn a lot of audiences off. I think, overall, L'Avventura is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's got gorgeous cinematography and wonderful art direction; If you're willing to set aside what happens in the movie and let yourself get lost not in what's happening but what's portrayed, you'll find this film a lot more likeable. I, myself, don't love it. I think it's an overrated film (it's in Roger Ebert's The Great Movies), but despite that...It still weaves a spell on the viewer, if you're watching it. Oddly enough, for a movie in which almost nothing occurs, it's almost 2 1/2 hours long. It's running time is about 2:20. The movie is about a group of rich friends; Anna (Lea Massari) and her lover Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), Anna's friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) and some others. When they reach a small island, Anna and Sandro have a little quarrel and soon Anna has disappeared. Like Picnic at Hanging Rock, we will never see her again or find out what happened to her. This film offers up a lot more theories than that film did but, when Anna is gone, Anna is gone. Antonioni teases us a bit by letting us (almost) see a boat, leaving us to wonder if Anna left on it. Anyway, the group looks for Anna and calls the coast guard...Eventually, they give up and return to shore. The rest of the film is (more or less) built on the foundation of the characters trying to find Anna, but the film is not a search for Anna at all. Antonioni makes it very clear in the beginning of the film that Anna is gone forever. The plot, if one can call it that, has Claudia and Sandro becoming lovers. They don't fall in love, love seems to be nonexistent in this movie...I won't say much more than that. Truth is, there's not much more to say. The final scene of the film is, in my opinion, simultaneously the most beautiful and haunting shot of the entire film. To be honest, this is a movie I'll probably have to see again. I think most people will find that this film doesn't connect with the immediately (and may never do so). I actually liked it, which gives me hope for future viewings that I may come to appreciate what everyone else saw. As for now, the casual commercial-film viewer will not like this movie. That I can damn near guarantee. People who like film, The Criterion Collection, or Antonioni will. If you don't fall into either of these categories, you might want to check it out and see what you think of it. I've said all I can."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Can't hardly stop watching!,"Out of all the teen comedies this is one, along with 10 Things I Hate About You, that stands out to me as worth watching.  I mean, anything with Seth Green is bound to be funny, but in this film he's just histarical.  The film revolves around Preston (Ethan Embrey) as he attends a party to give Amanda (Love-Hewitt) a letter explaining his long time love for her.  His best friend Denise (Ambrose) is tagging along for moral support but she can't help but shedding her opinion on the matter, which is that Preston is crazy.  You see Amanda just broke up with Mike Dexter the school jock and well, you get the drift.  But Mike has problems of his own.  A group of high-school nerds headed by William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo) have decided to crash the party with a plan to ruin Mike's life.  Then we have Kenny ""Special K"" Fisher (Seth Green), the wigger/white boy gangsta who has come to the party equipped to get laid and will stop at nothing for sex.  The cast is hilarious and really do well portraying the high-school scene.  There are plenty of laughs including some unmentioned actors like Williams nerd friends playing Star Wars on the roof and some kids trying to teach a foreign exchange student some 'proper' english.  The whole concept of the film may be cheesy and overdone but the script is tight and the laughs are plenty so it more than makes up for the genericy.  Love-Hewitt is not a favorite of mine but Green and Ambrose are hilarious as is the nerdy Korsmo.  Watch this film for what it is and laugh your @$$ off while doing so"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Nice Choreagraphy, Effective Atmosphere","This is a beautiful film that will touch anyone who knows a lot or at least some things about professional dance. It has a very effective atmosphere and nice dance scenes. The story is also interesting, with nice acting and inspirational quotes. The choreographies are very good without any doubt, and I really liked the costumes! There are some very good dancers in this film. I would prefer a professional dancer in the place of Patrick Swayze. Patrick is a great actor but unfortunately only an amateur when it comes to dance. No matter how the director films it, it is not possible to entirely hide the fact that he is no pro and the difference with the rest of the dancers is obvious. Still, I enjoed the film and this proves that it is generally composed in a great way."

dvd,4 of 8,2.0,"THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DAVIS BABY, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WITH THE FILM ITSELF ","Although I knew this movie might not fit my expectations, I still ordered all three parts in a box from British amazon, much because of its cult status among horror fans. Actually I wanted to watch this since I was a boy. And I was right as well as many reviewers (I mean about expectations) - ""It's Alive"" appeared to be rather boring and not scary at all. The only pluses I saw in it are great work by John P. Ryan (I always adored him) and that nostalgic feeling I got while watching. And by nostalgic I mean the epoch of 70s itself shown in the film, and the way movie was shot. Nowdays we used to see monsters from the first minutes on screen, and in ""It's Alive"" we get to see the evil baby just closer to the end. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Latter day Kurosawa/Mifune masterpiece,"Like one of the other reviewers said I too was a bit hesitant in seeing this.  I had, up to that point, seen only Kurosawa's samurai based films, but then I saw Stray Dog and was sold on the fact that the man truly was a master of not just samurai films, but cinema, as an art form, in general."
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Love this movie!,"I know, it may be a Hollywood ending, but I love that the girls live happily ever after. This movie struck a cord with me on a personal level, and the actresses are HOT! So as not to sound superficial, the story is the main thing here, and not the girls. Highly recommended"

She discovers that the cheers and routines for the last several years have been stolen from another school's squad. Torrance relies on a reluctant gymnast named Missy (Eliza Dushku) to convince the cheer team to learn new material to take to the next state competition. What a shame it is that the football team is so awful that the schools pride is in the cheerleaders.

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A beautiful film that pulls at the heart strings!,"I'm an avid reader, always have been, but I've felt kind of burned out of reading as of late, and who wouldn't be after reading hundreds and hundreds of books, one after another, usually reading two books at a time, several books a week?  Also, my schedule no longer allows me the freedom to read as much as I used to.  And that is why I decided to watch this film when Netflix sent it to me despite the fact that I hadn't read the Nicholas Sparks novel first.  Now I wish I'd read the book.  This is one of the most beautiful tear-jerking stories I have seen!  Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for stories that pull at the heart strings.  They also know that stories centered on star-crossed lovers are my major weakness.  Most of my all-time favorite books and movies have those characteristics in common.  I won't go into details about the plot because I don't want to give away spoilers to potential viewers (though I'm sure many people have done that already) -- all I can say is that you cannot go wrong with this film if you're a hopeless romantic.  The actors are wonderful.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams transmit all of the right emotions and do a flawless job with the characterization.  They add a great deal of depth and range to their characters and I can't imagine better actors for the roles.  Gena Rowlands is also wonderful as the older Allie.  And I like the 1940s setting and the backdrop -- however brief -- of the second world war.  The wardrobe, settings, scenery and cinematography are flawless.  The DVD is a great investment.  The widescreen edition makes viewing all the more pleasurable.  I cannot recommend The Notebook enough.  I don't know if I'll read the book because I don't like reading novels after I have watched their film adaptations, but I will definitely read other Nicholas Sparks novels in the not-so-distant future"

Who's the murderer, Catherine, the shrink who lusts over her, or the cop who's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key? Catherine certainly gets around: She manages to befriend the most unlikely of people, all associates or ex-wives or enemies of the shrink, and most of them end up dead.

dvd,,5.0,Couldn't Be Happier,"""Happy Texas"" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It has a good natured sense of humor, great performances by all the actors, especially Steve Zahn and William H. Macy, and to see the handsome Jeremy Northam act convincingly as an American convict, while remembering his many roles as an Englishman with an upper-class accent, gives a special buzz to the movie.  The little girls of the Miss Fresh Squeezed Pageant are a delight.  Both escaped convicts (Zahn and Northam) find true love and the promise of happiness, once they serve their sentences.  The story is pure fantasy -- not the way life really is but the way we wish it could be."

The dvd was a huge disappointment because it didn't deal with letters but focused on rhyming words, etc.  Not suitable for my son's age, boring and short.  They sing a 60 second song with the alphabet that is an extra feature and that was the only thing he liked.  Not a good buy"

He was going through a lot because of a painful divorce, the death of his mother, the studio burned down during filming, and he even suffered a nervous breakdown. Reasons such as this caused Chaplin not to mention this painful period in his 1964 autobiography. This is definatley one of the greatest films of all time and with a beautiful ending that, arguably rivals City Lights."

dvd,3 of 9,4.0,Another Mick Foley DvD,"I think they should keep this set and just a another disc to make it a 3 disc collection and just name it ""Mick Foley Greatest Hits & Misses Plus The Lost Disc"" and use the same format they did on the first 2 discs but mick foley intrducing each match heres wat that last disc should look like."
dvd,,5.0,"Doctor Who, First Season","At first I had a hard time getting used to the new Doctor, having such a fondness for Tom Baker.  I soon fell in love with the whole show, however.  I find the interaction of Rose with the characters from different times interesting; it's more personal and engaging than the older series.  More suspensful, too.  The fact that the film makers kept most of the series Earth-related is slightly disappointing, but I think it was because of both budget and visual considerations.  It adds something to the show to have a lot of outdoor shots and not just studio scenes; it makes it more easy to relate to.  Overall, I think it's fantastic!   "
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,Good film update of old series,"Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) seem to have it all, until she is murdered.  The police believe that Richard killed her, and there is enough evidence to convict him, and a serious miscarriage of justice results in Richard being on a train on his way to prison.  But, there is a train accident, Richard escapes, and he goes on a quest for his wife's true killer, while trying to keep one step ahead of the police, led by Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones)."

dvd,5 of 6,5.0,A must Own Collection,"I,ve must tell you after Receiving Sam Peckinpah's Legendary Collection and Watched for the First Time Ride the High Country i realised, Just For that Movie was Worth Buying This Box,not to say that the Wild Bunch is one of the Best Westerns ever made and one of my Favorites."
dvd,5 of 12,5.0,Happy to be ignorant,"I am looking forward to all the racial slurs in the future releases. Not only are they hilarious, it shows how bad things were and how attitudes have drastically changed in favor of the politically correct viewpoint. No racism isn't gone. Guess what? Never will be. But it is so cool to see television before politically correct sensorship strangled the creativity and ""time stamp"" quality that is televisions greatest asset"
dvd,,5.0,A breathtaking epic,"Remaking a classic can be a thankless undertaking, but Peter Jackson has crafted a film that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original. Although he rarely mentions other films in KONG history, Jackson has taken elements not only from the 1933 original, but also the DeLaurentiis remake, SON OF KONG, and even KING KONG ESCAPES to forge an epic film about a giant ape and the woman he loves. It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well. Of course this also brings the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic. Many uninformed critics have labelled this movie ""Jurrassic Kong,"" but clearly they are not familiar with the amout of dinosaurs that populate the original film. Now the expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences and they are a real treat, particularly the ""Log Raft"" sequence. This new edition is well worth the time and expense, and the Kong mini-statue is a cool bonus - GET IT NOW"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"""Can Anyone Play?""","First off I agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie.  When Denise Richards sees Matt Dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like, ""Is this just a game for the boys, or can anyone play?"" She looks so sweet and hot that it's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later.  However she pulls ift off pretty well.  In fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well.  I couldn't understand why Kevin Bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual, but that was actually pretty good acting....I can't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists, but it's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,"Exciting Cartoon that kids, teens, and adults can love","Avatar: The Last Airbender is a great cartoon.  While it may appear to be a ""anime"" type cartoon at first glance, it is in fact made entirely in the US, and is based on Chinese Martial Arts.  The character voices are engaging and believable.  The plot is not too outlandish and it is a cartoon that is actually telling a story, a new chapter with each episode."
dvd,4 of 8,5.0,Awesome,"I just bought this yesterday. I had to. A friend of mine has it and she showed me some of the videos and they were awesome. So I had to go buy it yesterday. I think its awesome. I'm not very familiar with APC. I know some of their music, but not very much. I kinda try to learn about them becuase Jeordie White (A.K.A. Twiggy Ramirez, Marliyn Manson's Ex-Bassist) is now in the band, and I love him. But it's a great collection of music and music video's. But, you have to get the unedited one, becuase edited cd's and dvd's SUCK!! Well, this probably isn't of very much help to you. But, I suggest buying it because it's awesome."
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Funny little flick,"FOUR DEAD BATTERIES won't blow your mind with cinematic delights, but it packs a mean comic punch.  The guys in this movie talk like guys really talk (about sex, women, etc.)  Take the ""R"" rating seriously here.  Plus the DVD is really well-rounded for a microbudget movie like this.  The ""Advice Track"" is very informative and wannabe filmmakers really shouldn't miss it."
dvd,,5.0,"Great Movie, but it's sadly untrue in real life","Quite coincidentally, this movie was on television last night, right after I broke up with my boyfriend and he left.  We broke up because he doesn't want to leave his 25 year marriage where there are now adult children, only to enter into my family (consisting of my little boy and me), and take on head of household, parental responsibilities again.  While I was single a long time until I married (at the age of 38) he never had prolonged single time where he could be mostly self-centered.  He wants that time now.  So he left."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Unpolished; Very Funny; Other Episodes? ,"This show is absolutely hilarious, but it is unpolished and can be difficult to watch at times.  It falls short of the ""brilliant"" label some attach to it, but you have to appreciate the risky and absurd humor given the time period this show aired (1990-ish) and the catatonic-drooling-on-your bib-while-you-are-spoon-fed-oatmeal-Full House-Uncle Joey-has-two-dates-at-the-same-time-oh-what-to-do humor of the time.

dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Good Wayne and Holden film,"Decent Civil War film of supposedly true event. Wayne and Holden's characters well drawn. Wayne the troop leader and Holden, his regimental surgeon, clash over appropriate treatment of the soldiers under Wayne's command. Story drags a bit from time to time, but generally enjoyable. Romance is a bit far fetched. But hey, this's a Wayne western, so not a lot of time spent on that. Story is that Wayne made this film in part to finance his project that was in preliminary production, The Alamo. "

dvd,2 of 3,4.0,EXTRAORDINARY --  MESMERIZING AND SAD,"What could've been sensational and exploitive given the subject matter (and highly ironic title), Werner Herzog's GRIZZLY MAN is instead a mesmerizing, perceptive and heart-rending account of Timothy Treadwell and girl friend Amie Huguenard's fateful attempt to live with and film Alaska's endangered, wild bears. "
dvd,,4.0,not perfect...but come on!,"Ok, I agree with the other reviews to a degree. There is a moment of freezing on Paul Rogers song. I agree if the goal was to highlight the Fender Strat that there could have been more big names and more emphasis on the strat. But I bought this dvd for David Gilmour. Anything else would be cake. If you forget that this is a celebration of the strat and ignore minor technical glitches (hey this was a relatively cheap dvd) and just pay attention to the music- I found it to be quite good! I don't find the performers to be ""bored and boring"" in the slightests. In fact most of them look like they are enjoying themselves immensely! I'm really glad I bought this dvd. If you are a perfectionist stay away from this dvd. If you just like music of a wide variety of styles.... get it. It really is pretty good. And a live version of Pink Floyds' ""Marooned"" (which will be an extra feature on the Pink Floyd Pulse dvd when it is FINALLY released in September) is unavailable on any other dvd... so that alone makes the disk worthwhile"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The Reno Team Reigns Supreme!!!,"Again, the Reno Sheriff's Department ravages the town with its ineptitude and craziness.  This volume culminates with the DA investigating the team's questionable actions while enforcing the law.  Notable guests are Mindy Sterling of Austin Powers fame and Dave Holmes who started out as an MTV VJ and now appears (or has appeared) as a host on practically every cable program imaginable.  Celebrity guest Kenny Rogers gets in a few digs when the deputies assigned to patrol his book signing really muck things up.  This series has not lost anything from the first season to this one.  And all the characters remain consistent and fun, given that this show is mostly improvised.  Can't wait for Season 3.  And keep up the great work, guys!  You are Reno's finest!!! "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Loosely based on a great book ""The Club Dumas""","I enjoyed the movie.  Depp does a great job in these ""normal"" man roles and this is no exception.  Intrigueing look in to the rare book collecting world which made the first part of the movie very enjoyable.  The second part of the movie was less enjoyable for me because it was becoming predictable and had nothing to do with reading the book."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Surprisingly good,"Cat o' Nine Tails is generally considered second-tier Argento.  In fact, Argento himself isn't too jazzed on it.  But I find it to be an excellent Hitchcock-inspired suspense film.  Yeah, it lacks the stylized, highly imaginative visuals of his later films, but that's not to say it lacks filmmaking verve and invention.  Far from it.  A must-have if you're an Argento fan, but I suspect it would have more appeal to a general audience than most of his films"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"Glorious, Wondrous, the  Greatest Rudolph of Them All!","Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer is indeed the most marvelous Christmas film ever! It is one of many superb animated films written by a great man named Romeo Muller. Rudolph is doubtless his best-loved work. I remember watching the film as a child, delighted and enraptured by the story that it told. Do you remember? Sam the Snowman as narrator (voiced and sung in the performance of a lifetime by Burl Ives); Rudolph the misfit and rejected reindeer; Rudolph's friend, Hermy the Elf, also a misfit because he doesn't like to make toys but wants to be a dentist; Yukon Cornelius, the prospector who befriends them both; the Abominable Snowmonster of the North (whom Yukon, in prospector slang, invariably calls a ""bumble""); the Island of Misfit Toys, and its winged lion ruler, King Moonracer; and many other characters and story threads. The presentation, interweaving, and resolution of all of these elements is positively Shakespearean in deftness, wit, poetic beauty and brevity of expression, depth, pathos, joy, moral instruction, and the sense that all ends as indeed it should. Grounded in a deep and sparkling love of all creation, these qualities characterize all of Romeo Muller's films.  If you will see it devotedly--indeed, if you will see any and all of Romeo's films--you will become a finer, more compassionate, and a more truly loving human being"
dvd,1 of 4,2.0,Euuuwww......Creepy!,"This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking ""Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?"" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Humor and Heartbreak,"This film doesn't offer an answer to a relationship's greatest challenge--fidelity.  Instead, it challenges perceptions about what makes for lasting love and what to expect from a long-term relationship and/or marriage.  While dealing with slightly predictable patterns and relationships (ignoring same-sex or unorthodox relationships outside traditional marriage) the stories are compelling and the characters sufficiently believable.  One could argue that it has a decidedly male point of view, but the ending was a cheeky way to remind the guys watching that women can wander too"
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,I am a card carrying member of the NRA but,"I really liked and enjoyed this movie.  The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention.  It will keep yours too, just give it a chance.  Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible.  I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching.  However, I may add this to my collection"
dvd,,5.0,I was shocked to think it better,"I had watched this version of Emma while in my young teens and disliked the movie very much. I have carried that dislike with me until recently now in my 20's I was compelled to watch this version again (I own the Kate Beckinsale version and like it). To my astonishment I actually like this version better! I like Austen's movie adaptations but have never read her books (except Sense and Sensibility in high school, which I don't remember). Some may call it lazy or unimaginative, but I prefer movies, though I know there would never be adaptations without the books but there it is. I do not know exactly what it was about this version that I like better; maybe that it seemed brighter and the characters were more fitting to their parts and there was more time to get to know each character better since this version is longer. The dialogue was much easier to understand (more modern that truely period based, but still fitting) and I am NOT a Paltrow fan but she was perfect in this role as Emma. I do still like the Beckinsale version, but I am almost sorry that I own it rather than this one, but am too cheap to own both =-)...."
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Great Movie.,"I show this to my High School students after studying Biochemistry, Cells, Basic Genetics and Genetic Technology.  They really get in to the movie and it's depiction of a real family's ordeal"
dvd,26 of 26,5.0,Pilates for Real People,I've been to a few Pilates classes and loved the Pilates routine itself but always found it so hard to keep up with the instructor and felt as if I was missing something.  I give this DVD a big thumbs up for taking the time to guide you through each exercise and come with with many modifications for us real world folks. 
dvd,1 of 6,5.0,Of course it's great,"It is Hilarious. I loved it. It is one of the funniest movies ever. Not that it's actualy a movie. But it is the funniest cartoon ever. I don't care if it's eleventy billion dollars, it's worth it"
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,Easy Dance,"This DVD is an excellent resource for learning basic steps.  I've used it to choreograph a musical, and it made my work simple.  The presentation of the backwards view allows for easy learning the first time - no need to practice over one's shoulder to look at the dancers"
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Where is the DVD??,"OK, for Johnny Depp fans everywhere, I request a DVD version of this movie. It's a great movie and it definately speaks for itself...a must see"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,A greatly underrated film,"I haven't seen this version of the film, which, according to some of these reviews, is terrible, but the version I saw called ""The Confidential Report"" was, in my opinion, one of the greatest films Orson Welles made. It deals with a very rich man named Mr. Arkadin who is somewhat mysterious. He hires a man who has been searching for him since he had heard his name from a man who was dieing, to make a report about Mr. Arkadin. Apparently, he had amnesia and forgot what happened to him at a young age. The young man becomes attached to Arkadin's daughter and travels all over the world to find new facts about arkadin's life. The movie ends with a great realization and a final scene of anguish. Critics may say that the movie is nonsensical, but the greatness of the movie is that it shows, much like Citizen Kane, the life and death of a great man"

She is joined by 4 other ladies, a couple of them I have also seen in Crunch workouts.  The are 2-15 minute dance routines, Afro-Latin and Reggae Funk.  A warm up and isolations segment precedes the dance workouts and the cool down follows."
dvd,,5.0,It is like they dropped the slides of the movie and mixed it up,"This movie is really fun because they mixed everything all around and made it confusing.  Pay attention the other person is right.  This movie is for people who like art movies.  It is violent.  Some people cannot follow it, but those who do love it.  I really loved it.  It is black and white so hopefully that does not turn you off, but it is really great.  This is one you have to think with and pay attention to.  This is not something to walk in and out of.  It would not make any sense at all.  Not one for kids.  They will be really confused.  It will take so long to explain it to them and still you may not be able to.  A smart teen could probably understand it, but some adults cannot.  If you are reading reviews I am sure you can.  It is some great mental exercise and so much better than other movies when you want something of more substance"
dvd,,5.0,brother bear 2,fun movie for the whole family that just makes you feel good no matter what the day  has in-store.  its message is unique about relationships of all walks of life and it gives you a sense of hope in the heart of what really matters; LIFE
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,one of the best in the noir genre,"fantastic screenplay, best directing and acting, best casting. a very good classic except some racial slurs off and on. the chinatown was tagged as no-mans-land, a zone-out area in almost everywhere in the world, not just in los angeles or new york. this movie tells it all. a modern 'oedipus' version. mother-wife-daughter-husband-father, a twisted tragedy to the extreme. a very nice timeless treat"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"This film is too hot to be called ""Ice Age""","Excellent computer generated animated feature that makes a case for one of the finest films of 2002.

An early group of human hunters become the hunted as a group of sabertooth tigers begin to plot revenge. As the attack occurs, a small infant child is taken out of harm's way.

dvd,3 of 5,4.0,Takes me back the my childhood.,I love this movie.  And I don't have anything bad to say about it.  But if you get the DVD be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match.  So you hear an actor speak before their mouths move.  This drove me crazy but I still enjoyed the movie
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,It was pretty good.,"It's not my favorite movie, but it was pretty good, and even a little funny."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,That's entertainment,"This is a prime time Tarantino story with a superb cast and great music. I have no idea why I came across this fun movie only now, it seems to have been overlooked and underrated when it came out in 93. Obviously it is much too violent and the language is definitely obscene. As I said, that's entertainment. Very entertaining."
dvd,,5.0,Wow! What a fun movie!,"A fun movie all around! Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke are definately the standout stars! Eventhough it's basically a romance movie it still rocks the house! I looooove the gen X 90's feeling it has to it. It really took me back. Lalaine's desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson, too. I also think that she picked the best one in the end. But, the best thing about Reality Bites is it's great filming location. H-TOWN! Makes me sooooo proud to be from here"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Amazing visual effects and solid acting make up for second-rate sound,"Tim Burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood.  From his stop-animation work (""The Corpse Bride"") to dark romances (""Edward Scissorhands"") to horror (""Sleepy Hollow""), Burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension."
dvd,1 of 1,1.0,1 DVD is not enough!,Im a huge Stone Cold fan and I have got to say that I am horribly dissapointed. This disc does not contain any of the good Stone Cold matches...specificlly the matches during the Austin/Mcmahon/Corporate Ministry era.

Chris Farley and Chris Rock were great and very endearing and I wish David Spade had been in this too. Like the other movies there is some great dialogue in this movie and I highly recommend the movie to fans of Chris Farley, Chris Rock and SNL. I taped this movie off a pay per view showing on Direct TV and I will be buying the DVD someday! I rate this movie a 5 for how much fun it is to watch it"
dvd,9 of 16,5.0,He Who Laughs Last,"This is the second DVD in the new Ghost in the Shell series. Again the story uses the premise of a heavily cyberneticized world to create a setting where what reality is often what someone has made of it. Technologiy is so embedded in day-to-day life that a full human seems to be the exception, not the rule. Whether this vast interconnection is a good thing or not is a question that is constantly asked the viewer - and rarely answered. "

As far as I remember, this was the first movie with Yakuza I ever saw. While clearly a low buget B-Movie it has a great story, great actors (many who went on to great things), GREAT SHOOT-OUTS (the factory shoot-out in the beginning . . .  I won't spoil the rest), and asian hotties. I even like the cheesy 80s music"

dvd,11 of 11,5.0,A great film about Van Gogh ,"Lust for Life based on Irving Stone's novel about Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) was filmed in 1956 and directed by Vincente Minnelli. Kirk Douglas as Vincent crackles with intensity. He won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal; depicting Van Gogh's artistic growth, deep loneliness and inevitable descent into madness with sensitivity and pathos. It is a moving performance that, along with Spartacus and Paths of Glory, is one of his best. Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. James Donald is especially touching as Vincent's loving Brother Theo. The film features a powerful and poignant musical score by the great film and Classical Music composer Miklos Rozsa, composer of music for Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Ivanhoe and The Lost Weekend amongst many others. This film is, along with John Huston's Moulin Rouge made in 1952 about the life of Toulouse-Latrec, one of my favorite Hollywood films about an artist."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Epic,"A powerful, sweeping movie that makes a character out of the Russian landscape, Doctor Zhivago is about a man broken by the times he inhabits.  Set around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution we're introduced to our main players - Zhivago, the good doctor; Tonya, the faithful wife; and Lara, the beauty who steals men's hearts.  The three and a half hour run time allows plenty of room for side plots, but the main tale is of Zhivago's path crossing with Lara on several occasions - through chance, through war, and through communist desperation - and how his marital fidelity is eventually defeated."

You cant do wrong but get this movie if your a martial arts fan. this is really worth a purchas
dvd,,5.0,As flawless as TV gets.,"       If season two merely maintained the delicious comedy found in season one it would be five-star worthy. Lucky for us, it exceeds season one...with stride. It only has the standard six episodes compared to season one's eight but that is easily forgivable."

dvd,25 of 27,5.0,MUCH better than it's being rated,"Okay, so they don't have Hollywood stars, but remember that this is an indie flick with a low budget. The directors do their very best by using period dialogue and actual quotes. Another point in their favor is that they actually filmed on location in Adams County, PA, rather than running off to Romania like ""Cold Mountain"" did. The battle is spectacular, using footage shot during the 140th Anniversary Reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg last July. The uniforms and equipment are authentic and not Hollywood knockoffs, and the special effects make you feel you're in the middle of the action. An EXCELLENT independent documentary, considering its budget and lack of major studio backing. This film has won awards and astute viewers and historians can see why"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,A Must Own!,"Without a doubt the best Stephen King and/or prison-break movie EVER made! Even after you've seen it once, you'll want to watch it over and over again."
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,"Really, my all-time favorite.","My husbands laughs when I say a movie is my favorite(I have many favorites), but this one really is. I also love to read and what sets this adaptation apart is the way the two complement eachother,truly brilliant. The movie adds elements that the book didn't dwell on and the book covers all the details that movies just can't. Some movies can touch your heart in such a way that they leave you a bit raw. For me, this is one of those movies. No, it may not be a cinematic event for all, but for those who have loved with their whole heart and have been (or even risked) being hurt, you will find a good laugh and a few tears here.  Only Nora Ephron herself could have wrote a screenplay that complemented her novel so well, and thankfully Mike Nichols brought it to life in such a way. Meryl Streep really is at her best here and the whole cast is excellent. I really do love this movie, it always amazes me that it is so underrated. Give it a try"

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Campy Good Fun,I am a fan of the stage show and yet I still love this movie.  First of all Dolly Parton IS Miss Mona . . . she is perfectly charming. This movie is like Grease . . . Let me explain . . . the movie doesn't match the stage show and yet it stands on it's own and has become a cult classic. It is even better on DVD . . . it's widescreen and you get to see so much more.
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,I thought RUN LOLA RUN would never have any competition. Boy! Was I wrong?,"Spun is an absolute pleasure to watch. It doesn't wait around to get noticed, instead it sets it's own pace, like for example - No credits roll in the beginning, no apologetic character introductions, there is no STOP sign in this film, everything is unhooked and raw,YET nothing seems to be out of place. The direction is bizzare, camerawork is staggering at places, the sets are like gutters, the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level. There are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too. The reason I compare Spun with Run Lola Run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the German wonderflick was. Spun is possibly one of a kind. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Trainspotting. Now, that is saying a lot. "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Great Documentary ,"After watching this tour-documentary the only impression i had left was that I wanted to watch more! If you are a fan of Joe Strummer this dvd is a must have. It follows Strummer and the mescaleros on tour in Japan, and really give a close look into what tour-life is all about. And that's hard work. "
dvd,,4.0,Interesting Sleeper,"""The Big Town"" doesn't break any cinematic ground but it's more than worth your while.  How can you go wrong with  a film that sports two Oscar winners(Tommy Lee Jones, Lee Grant) and three nominees(Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Bruce Dern) in the cast?  Director Ben Bolt imbues the film with terrific period atmosphere and the selection of rock, rhythm and blues, and country and western music is impeccable.  The film has a gritty sensiblity reminiscent of classic film noir.  Dillon is fine as the kid from Indiana with a knack for dice rolling who seeks his fame and fortune in the seedy backrooms of Chicago.  It's Jones, however, who steals the picture in an understated turn as the film's ostensible villain.  Jones doesn't have to say a word.  Just a squint of his eyes and a look at his craggy visage says it all.  Good character turns from vets Grant and Dern as the couple who bankroll Dillon's endeavors.  The two women in Dillon's life, Lane's exotic dancer and Suzy Amis' aspiring DJ are kind of underwritten.  These two are kind of cliched in representing the good girl/bad girl dichotomy.  The promised showdown between Dillon and Jones is kind of a fizzle.  Another disappointment is Lane's less than erotic fan dance"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"Return to Peyton Place  - ""Top Notch""","I liked this movie! And here's why: It's an exciting film whose content centers around a first-time novelist from a small New England town, a new trip to the big city (New York), and the whirl wind business of book publishing. Carol Lynley stars as the young writer Allison MacKenzie who works with Lewis Jackman(played by Jeff Chandler), a married head of the book firm in the Big Apple of the early 60's. Context really comes into play here, as a variety of top stars end up influencing each other, and Allison herself, who ends up with feelings for Lewis, as well as some she has never experienced before. The beautiful seasons of autumn and winter add to the nostalgic imagery of this movie in the northern states and the hustle and bustle of New York. With the introduction of Allison's new book to the world, she sets the literary world on fire, as well as the people she knows and loves in her own small New England town! Related items would be the first movie Peyton Place(B&W)and the book of the same name by Grace Metallious. While the first movie and the book were good, Return to Peyton Place holds it's own and is even better.  "

dvd,5 of 6,2.0,Waste of time...,"As much as I like Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, I really wanted to like this film.  I enjoyed them in Kiss The Girls, and I expected another interesting film.  Their performances were the only bright spot, but they couldn't rescue this movie.  This film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream.  There was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible.  As many other reviewers noted (I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces), it was so very predictable.  "
dvd,,5.0,Kurosawa Goodness!  Heaven and Hell.,"Yes, I am a fan of Kurosawa, but I am also a critic.  This film, like some of his others, does seem to wander off from the narrative thread.  Focusing on characters that, initially, don't seem as important to the story, for large chunks of film.  However, as Kurosawa also often does, when the final scene has played and you are left with what the film is.  You realize all of the footage is vitally important to what Kurosawa is trying to show you.  As the title suggests, this film is an examination of the human condition and how people can strive to become all that they can or how they can let themselves become much less than they should.  The separation of heaven and hell or, of high and low"

dvd,6 of 8,5.0,MY FAVORITE MOVIE AND ER EPISODE OF ALL TIME!,"My friend got me hooked into ER a year ago and I could not stop watching it. I watch the episodes every Thursday on NBC, but this movie is the best of all. I got this for Christmas one year, and since then I have probably seen it 20 times. It gives me a good feeling whenever I watch it, which horror movies can't do, and I love horror movies (just click see more about me to find out!) The music sets the tone for the movie. The movie is perfect and I couldn't see how it could get any better. It is weird to think that only a few characters from this movie still live on in the show today. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes hospitals, medical dramas, or just anyone who likes that feeling of a good movie. That is how good this movie is"
dvd,2 of 6,5.0,LOVE IT,"I loved this movie, even though it seemed a bit clich at times, it made me want to watch it over and over again after it ended, something not many movies do"
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Good movie...bad ending...,"Too be short & sweet I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie up until the extremely brief ending.  You get to the highlight of the movie & then BAM!...it's over.  I would've liked a little more explained or to see what happened to Jamie Foxx's character but it wasn't a huge deal just a little disappointment.  I loved seeing Top Cruise in a ""bad guy"" role.  It was a nice change & I thought he played it very well.  These 2 actors together gave my husband & I many laughs.  I'd recommend this movie"
dvd,,4.0,Great!!,"I have an 11 year old and 8 year that really enjoy this DVD.  It is easy to follow for all ages.  They love to do the family part.  Sometimes it is difficult to get kids motivated, but this DVD really helps"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Truly a gift for your DVD collection,"The Gift is a riveting, very well-acted movie about a woman named Annie (Blanchett) who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her 3 young sons. She gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town. One of her clients (Swank, who you can always count on for a remarkable performance) has an abusive husband (Reeves, fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here) who thinks what Annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again. Then, the daughter (Holmes) of an important man goes missing. She's engaged to a man named Wayne who works at the school where Annie's boys go (I believe he is the principal, but I could be mistaken...sorry, but in any event, played by Greg Kinnear). But there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale, and soon the police, with no clues as to where the daughter is, turn to Annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Voltaire would be proud!,"This is an outstanding rendition.  Kristin Chenoweth is the most amazing soprano I've heard in many years, and the other performers were wonderful too.  Any fan of opera will love this work.  Enjoy"
dvd,1 of 12,1.0,Wasting space on my DVD shelf...,"I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it."
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Meet The Fockers (A classic),"Meet the Fockers to me was a really funny movie.  Ben Stiller is like my alltime favortite actor and he did do a great job in this movie. However, the original (Meet the parents) was a five star all the way.  This one to me was not as good but it did have it's moments.  If you were to go and buy this movie, watch the original first.  (If you haven't seen the original movie, I strongly recommend watching that one first.  After watching the original, you'll probably argee that Meet the Fockers was not as good"

dvd,8 of 9,4.0,The perfect routine & teacher!,"I usually go to yoga classes, but when I can't make it to an actual class this DVD is almost like being in a class. The voice instructions are really clear and are perfectly timed with the movements of the video, so when you look up, she's doing what you should be. The main flow contains every element an intermediate vinyasa person could want: pigeon, plow, eagle, wheel, triangle, extended side angle, etc. It's not a multi-level workout - if you can't do the exact poses, she doesn't offer many lower-level options"
dvd,,5.0,Ignore the people who knock this CLASSICK!,"No this isn't near as good as The Chainsaw Massacre and nothing Tobe Hooper has done has been, BUT just see this to see NEVILLE BRAND! The man was an underrated actor who plays his underplayed role just right!"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"Very entertaining thriller, not scary though.","Fallen is a very good movie, however, I wouldn't classify it as horror just because it involves demons. It was more thrilling than anything and will certainly hold your interest. Perhaps there are people out there who would find Fallen to be a scary horror movie, but for me, I did not. I did thoroughly enjoy it and am delighted to have it grace my collection. "
dvd,,5.0,Enter the Creepshow!!!!! Tickets Please!!!!!,"It is perhaps best to initially take a glance at the comic books that inspired this collection of creepy tales, pulps published throughout the 1940s and 1950s by E.C. Comics and boasting such titles as TALES FROM THE CRYPT, HAUNT OF FEAR, WEIRD SCIENCE and VAULT OF HORROR.  Television was still in its early stages and it would be a few years before quality horror made its way onto the screen.  Horror fans, then, targeted the news stands for their fix of the unreal and the unnatural; they were introduced to tales of rotting corpses and ghouls rising from the grave by The Crypt Keeper and his fiendish friends The Vault Keeper and The Old Witch. There were adaptations of Poe and Lovecraft, and Ray Bradbury (see THE OCTOBER GAME) frequently contributed stories, further enhancing E.C. Comics popularity. Two young readers of 'Tales' during the 1950s would have been horror icons Stephen King and George A. Romero, the comics having a considerable influence on their own future works.  Sadly censorship laws meant that E.C. Comics were taken off the market, but they would not be buried forever ... which brings us to CREEPSHOW. "
dvd,,5.0,GREAT MOVIE,This is a great flick if you are a history type or a motorcycle guy.
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Jillian Michaels-Cardio Kickbox Rocks!,"I love cardio kickboxing, so of course I had to try my favorite workout guru, Jillian Michaels', new cardio kickbox DVD!  I went through it once and was sweating, so I decided that 30 minutes just wasn't enough for me and went through it again!  I had to get a towel, I was that sweaty!  A great, easy to follow cardio workout that can easily be done without any extra workout tools...no weights, steps, resistance bands required...just your body and your energy!  Jillian suggests doing this workout once per week in the middle of the week to break up resistance training, however I think it's a great before-work...don't have time to go to the gym workout to get motivated for the day.  I agree with some of the other reviewers...the music could be much better and the workout could be much longer!  The downloadable exercise logs are a great bonus.  However, the 3 recipes are a little lacking"
dvd,,5.0,"Very eerie, well written","I love scary, haunted house flicks. What I don't like are cheesy monsters, buckets of blood (The Shining excepted), computer effects, etc."
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,"Very Cliched, Less-Than-Spectacular","As a guy, when I see the word ""lesbian"" on a DVD cover...I spring for it. Usually, (in my experience) it's a pretty stupid movie. ""Julie Johnson"" is done in a more mature and sophisticated way than the other ones I've seen, but there's still a lot missing here. Julie Johnson is played by Lili Taylor, who has lost her looks quite a bit since I saw her in John Waters' ""Pecker."" Julie is a typical housewife. She's a stay-at-home-mom (one of her children is Mischa Barton, formerly of ""The O.C.""), with no High School diploma and a mean husband (Noah Emmerich) who frequently downsizes her. When she decides she's going to get her GED and, possibly, go to college her husband finally pushes her too far and she kicks him out of the house. Her friend, Claire (Courtney Love, in a marvelously subdued performance), is inspired by Julie's decision and leaves her husband. Julie allows Claire to stay with her and the kids and eventually admits to Claire that she has sexual feelings for her. Claire is mad, at first, but eventually admits to the same feelings. Pretty soon, the neighborhood catches on and the couple become outcasts; The film eventually ends abruptly, almost as if one of the lead actors died before they could finish filming. The movie is pretty cliched, you can see what decision the character is going to make about five minutes before they actually do. Taylor plays the role very realistically and Love delivers one of her best performances. This didn't affect my enjoyment (or lack) of the film, but I'm merely saying this as a warning to other viewers. THIS FILM CONTAINS ABSOLUTELY NO NUDITY. The movie has a kind of organic feel to it and the cinematography is less-than-spectacular. It's better than a film like ""Better Than Chocolate"" but if you never see this film in your lifetime...It's not going to affect anything."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,The Undertakers Wind and other Stuff,"The groundbreaking DR. NO is one of the best James Bond films of the series. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant entrusted with a ""licence-to-kill"" when he chooses, where he chooses and whom he chooses. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. Connery's portrayal in this film directed by Terence Young seems closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Many elements that distinguish the James Bond series were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" M played by Bernard Lee, Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell, Ken Adam's distinctive melding of modern and futuristic production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" exotic locales, just to name a few are all here. Bond is sent to Jamaica, land of the Undertakers Wind, to investigate the elimination of British field agents and strange signals that have been interfering with the American space program. Joseph Wiseman as DR. NO is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves the most indelible image of the series as she emerges erotically from the blue waters of the Caribbean clad in her white bikini. Along with Felix Leiter and Quarrel, Bond must uncover the trail that all leads to DR. NO's mysterious Crab Key. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is the one film closest to any of Ian Fleming's Bond novels. George Lazenby, possessing the physique and physical attributes that fit the role, gives a visually striking and straightforward performance in his only appearance as James Bond. The combined efforts of all the filmmakers and Lazenby's performance of a James Bond with conviction, assuredness and determination make this the definitive James Bond film. The film has a sense of undeniable drive behind it accentuated by Lazenby's no-nonsense approach and the urgency of John Barry's instrumental theme used repeatedly to never let up the pace. If James Bond was ever the dedicated civil servant it is ever so evident in this film. There are intensely choreographed fights of great ferocity, exciting and incredible ski chases, car chases, an alpine battle atop an ice-capped peak and an extraordinary thrilling bobsled chase. There is more action, suspense and emotion packed into this film than any other in the series and Lazenby's hard edged performance, Peter Hunt's direction and John Barry's driving score make it all work. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is possibly the best film of the series. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN contains one of Roger Moore's best performances as James Bond as he injects Bond's virility, worldliness and sardonic wit back into the character in his second appearance as Bond. Christopher Lee's performance as the enigmatic Scaramanga is refreshingly energetic giving the assassin an amiable quality on the surface hiding a darker side beneath. An often-overlooked asset to this film is Maud Adams' performance as Andrea, Scaramanga's beautiful mistress. She brings genuine compassion to the role as the tormented individual who can not escape her master. There is also great location cinematography in this film. We see Bond at the gambling tables at the Casino de Macaoand and witness his solo flight through the uprooted rock formations near Phuket, Thailand to Scaramanga's island. One bit of innovation combing location filming, miniatures and set design was the use of the half-submerged Queen Elizabeth, its hull at a 30-degree angle, scorched and rusted at rest in Hong Kong harbor. Hidden in the bowels of the sunken ship is the headquarters for the Hong Kong station of the British Secret Service. ""It's the only place in Hong Kong where you can't be bugged"" says a naval officer to Bond. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN contains martial arts sequences, an imaginative car chase and some very witty dialogue. The music soundtrack by John Barry was re-mastered in stereo. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is a big-budgeted opulent film with effective screenplay and editing delivering one of the most succinctly structured films of the series. Roger Moore clearly redefined his approach to the role as the good-natured British agent. His Bond is suave, debonair, never condescending and resorts to seriousness only when confronted with malevolence. That was the way he played it for the rest of the series.  The globetrotting THE SPY WHO LOVED ME featured a gadget laden Lotus Esprit as its centerpiece and a maniacal villain Stromberg whose immense wealth featured an aquatic empire aimed at global domination. Great action sequences and chases abound. MOONRAKER is one of the biggest films of the entire series. Once again Bond is on the trail of another maniacal villain, Hugo Drax, whose immense wealth has financed the research and production of the space shuttle program. This is also another globetrotting epic that features gorgeous location work in Venice and Rio de Janeiro bringing out the of essence of these exquisite cities. Following his work on THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, production designer Ken Adam returned with some sets reminiscent of the earlier Bond films as well as some completely innovative sets for Drax's space empire. MOONRAKER plays like a compendium of the entire series running the gamut from the serious to the fanciful. MOONRAKER contains many elements to please the diverse tastes of the millions of Bond fans. That is the magic of MOONRAKER. There is incredible action in this film. The free-fall sequence is one of the best pre-title sequences of the series. The boat chase in the South American jungle is truly thrilling. Bond's fight in the Venetian glass museum is a classic. John Barry's score is exquisite and moving, one of his most unique. The dialogue by Christopher Wood is witty and intelligent. MOONRAKER has it all. This Volume demonstrates the versatility and diversity of the world of James Bond"
dvd,,5.0,An affair of the heart,"This is one of my all time favorites. Robert DiNiro and Meryl Streep are in the beginning innocently attracted to each other. As time goes on as Meryl is visiting her father, their love grows until it becomes entangled in lies and deceipt but a passionate affair. They are emotionally attached, but never get together physically. They know it is wrong, but they can't help falling in love with each other. The movie shows the turmoil of thoughts especially the scene when Meryl gets a phone call from Robert DiNiro asking her to meet him and she fights with her conscience about going. Unfortuately the situation doesn't allow her to go and the scene is so moving. They go their separate ways, only to end up together in the end at a later time. I love this movie and I can watch it over and over again. If you are sentimental you must see it. But don't hold judgement for them and don't take it as a threat to your existing happy marriage. My husband and I have been married for 34 years and still in love."
dvd,7 of 9,4.0,A Descent into Dante-esque Night,"""Kandahar"" is a collection of slightly fictionalized vignettes of Afghan life in the 1990s, loosely grouped together in a putative dramatic plot.  The ""plot,"" such as it is, has to do with a woman who had been born in Afghanistan, and had escaped to Canada some years previously.  For reasons of her own, she seeks to make her way to Kandahar, in Afghanistan, beginning from one of the refugee camps on the Afghan border with Iran.  On the way, she meets with several normal, regular, ordinary Afghan people, and learns about their normal, regular, everyday Afghan horrendous lives.  The reason to see this film is to see the people she meets."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,This Island Earth,"Classic 50's sci-fi.  I especially liked how they gave the scientist a jet plane to get around in given to him by ""the guys at Lockheed"".  Thinly veiled cold war paranoia flick.  Faith Domergue looks awesome in her tight Metaluna catsuit.  Only thing I found distracting is that The Professor from Gilligan's Island plays one of the scientists... I kept expecting to see Mary-Ann and Ginger. "
dvd,,4.0,SO THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERN MEANT?,"I haven't seen the two previous CUBE movies, but I understand this is sort of a ""prequel"" to them.  Admittedly a bizarre little film, it's an innovative and eerily effective little chiller that plays on the Big Brother concept to the fullest.  The setting and special effects are above average for an independent low budget film, and Zachary Bennett as the geek hero and Michael Riley as the one-eyed corporate exec give good performances.  A downbeat ending is inevitable, and the movie's plot not entirely resolved, but CUBE ZERO is a dandy little film"

Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting"

dvd,0 of 3,2.0,Turkey Lurkey Time,"Wow. This is a BAD film. Where to begin? The young cast is talented and appealing but the writing completely lets these talented youngsters down. Was it written for 14-year-olds or by 14-year-olds? Comparing it to those shallow but well-intentioned ABC after-school specials from the 70s is insulting to the latter. Also, it is incredibly offensive that 25 years after ""Fame"" we still are subjected to the sad, doomed Paul McCrane gay character (who cross-dresses, naturally), living unrequited and unfulfilled -- in the final scenes he must content himself with watching the straight boy and girl find the happiness denied him. Todd Graff's heart is obviously in the right place, but please Todd, hire a real writer of some depth next time. The score is marvelous, however, and deserves a better film. There are some rare comic moments, but not enough to recommend this film. In fact, adults should stay away from this stinker, only musical theater teens and pre-teens could possibly find this film engaging"

The binary theory being very scientific, but its influence on civilization is a bit more questionable. The only bad thing is the Byrds song (turn, turn, turn), kind of cheesy and too obvious of a selection. I guess its hard to take such a theory seriously with that song as the opener/closer."

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"""We'll stop and ask for directions...""","I've always found Martin Short to be hysterical, but you know who really surprised me here was Kurt Russell who played against type (in a role I would have seen Martin Short playing) and stole every minute of the show.  The film follows a family as they hire a boat captain to help them sail their inherited boat from a Caribbean Island (something like Potato) to Miami so they can sell it.  They plan on spending a family bonding 45-day adventure at sea and end up spending 45 days of hell on the water.  What's great about this film is that it's far from predictable, it's humorous and witty and completely unexpected and will keep you entertained until the very end.  Martin Short and Mary Kay Place are great as the loving parents who are a bit conflicted with their unconventional new captain, and Kurt, as I already mentioned, is superb as Captain Ron.  Great fun for the whole family and well worth every minute of laughs, this one goes down as a classic comedy great for those rainy days (like my 4th of July)"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Beautiful the second time around...,"When I watched this film for the first time several years ago, I thought it was mind-numbingly boring.  Now that I've become a big fan of film adaptations and, more important, period pieces, I thought it would be fair to give this film a second chance.  A Room with a View is a beautiful, passionate love story that keeps real to E.M. Forster's novel.  This is the story of Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and the choices she has to make.  Should she choose her boring, but socially approved fianc� Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis) or should she follow her heart and choose the adorable and passionate George (Julian Sands), whom she met during a trip to Florence, Italy?  Should she settle for the demands and social mores of Edwardian England?"

Over the years I've several different trainer's videos & CD's, and overall, I love Tamilee the best! I was a little disappointed in the Weight Loss CD- just screens to read- not even a narrative, but good info"

dvd,4 of 8,5.0,great series and cute anime character,"This show had it ALL but a great story...in my opinion this would have been my favority show if it weren't for the story. First off ALL characters were likable...there was not one character who did not fit in the whole ordeal. Second, the music is great, it's perfect for the atmosphere!!! The show has a great setting (great atmosphere and mood)...and it's a good mystery show. I was having sooo much fun with it and therefore expected a lot from the story (since there was lots of mystery and suspense) but I was pretty disappointed with the story....In genereal great show!!"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Raising The Bar and Let's Get It Right,"Most everyone who has given an online review of Moulin Rouge has noted the color and clarity of this DVD release, and I agree with the consensus, the picture quality is excellent. For some reason what seems to be overlooked is the SOUND QUALITY of the film. Apparently, the sound wasn't cleaned-up as best as it could have or was not given the attention it should have been given or there was nothing that could have been done. I tend to believe if closer attention was given to the audio it could have been better. Let's not forget besides viewing the film we also have to listen to it. Quite a few times I had to go back to watch a scene over to understand the dialogue. Hopefully next time around when MGM updates this DVD the'll take another crack at the audio. When it comes to buying CD's and DVD's, sometimes we will only get the best quality if we demand it. Video and Record executives have earned a reputation for taking shortcuts and it is up to consumers to hold them to a higher standard"
dvd,,5.0,"""WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN"", JOHN LENNON (OCT. 9TH 1940- DEC. 8TH 1980) THE MAN THE IMMORTAL LEGEND, I  MISS YOU JOHN!!!","Excellently remastered dvd with some extra added features not in the original theatrical release.i enjoyed this movie which covered lennons childhood to the beatles to the post beatle dakota years. Amazing footage and in depth coverage of lennons life. John was really a genius who got killed at forty years of age, and could have offered future generations his presence and talent. Thanks to a sick sadistic oportunistic person, lennon  along with a generation and future generations were killed. At the time of lennons death, the lesson I learned is that there are honest nice people in the world along with opportunist who will do anything to take something they cant have. We are all at times looking for opportunities to get ahead in life, lennons killer wanted to get famous quick and easy and did'nt care about the ramifications, the killing of a great man and a generation and the future. Check this dvd out even if you are new to lennon or have little interest in john lennon, this movie will get your interest as you watch a really great mans short but plentiful life unfold. Not everyone agreed with lennons political views and lifestyle but for some reason lennons magnetic personallity grabbed all the lennon naysayers and lennon haters interest. I miss you john"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,"w/Sony producing now, it helps bring new life into the MGM catalog","The MGM catalog was hurting really bad - customers crying fowl over fake widescreen releases, poor quality for the real ones.  They really needed a second wind, and Sony - combined with the Lowry process really brought the 007 series back."
dvd,,4.0,AM GOnna GEt YOu and Your little DOg 2!,"ALyssa Milano is HOT , HOT , HOT. I like this movie, it is like a reverse teen version of Fatal Attraction. Made after The Crush and before SwimFan, fell right in between and much better film than both, much more suspenseful and better actors at that"
dvd,,4.0,Bond:  The Beginning!,"Here is where it all started!  Sean Connery at his roughest and toughest as Bond.  ""You've had your six!""  Ursula Andress is THE classic ""Bond Girl""!  ""Looking for shells?""  ""No, I'm just looking.""  Joseph Wiseman a forboding presence as Dr. No.  This time the Bond Baddie didn't need a superhuman henchman.  He had his hands!  Of course, this is basically just a modern day detective story.  The exciting action sequences are rather sparse in this one.  Still lots of danger, intrigue, suspense, and good character development to get this action film franchise off to a good start. "
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,Thoughtful movie of a beautiful book,"I did the whole thing in reverse order, saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw it the first time, it was a lovely portrayal of a family in the upheavals of Russia. I read the original book and was captivated by the theme. The story of an ideal person during the hard times is difficult to capture in a movie. A lot of the reviewers gave the movie a bad rating due to this. However, I do not give too much heed to this as I have enjoyed a number of movies that reviewers trashed. A review happens due to the circumstances of the times etc. This movie has stood the test of times. The book is more detailed about the communism and its impact on the people. It has more layers in the story than shown in the movie. "
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,One of Meryl Streep's finest performances and a really excellent film!,Plenty is one of my all-time favourite films. I loved this movie.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,LOVE THIS MOVIE...You Gotta love little Joaquin (fka ,"If you have kids, this is one of the funniest and truest movies ever made about life and its messy rollercoaster ride.  Dianne Weist shines in this role, understated, yet flummoxed and nonplussed, when she rants about how she can't be a grandmother (""I was at Woodstock!  I peed in a field!  I hung onto the Who's helicopter, for Christ's sake!"") and her date responds, ""You were at Woodstock? So was I!""  Her snarled, ""Oh yeah?  I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED FAMILIAR!""  is just priceless.  Rick Moranis as the parent of a tiny prodigy terrified by normal goofing around, Keanu Reeves in the one role where he shows not only emotions but manages to tug at your heartstrings when he tells Dianne Weist, who feels her son needs a man around, that it depends on the man:  ""My dad used to wake me up by flicking lit cigarette butts at my head, saying, [...]"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,SHOCKED,"I bought this movie just because of the main character. I liked it. It was a little confusing. There was three time differences. The vacation with his family, the time he tried to commit suicide and then when he came back. But the thing that shocked me was when i was watching the extras and the press was asking Jeremie if it was difficult (or something) playing in a gay role. I thought that he was gay. In the two movies-this one included-of his i have seen he is a gay character. But the movie is GREAT. strongly reccomended to anyone with an open mind"
dvd,40 of 44,5.0,GO ASK ALICE,"EYE OF THE KILLER is one of those unexpected surprises you get when you see a movie on DVD you haven't heard of before.  Kiefer Sutherland plays a cop who is heavy on booze and genuinely disinterested in his life.  His ex-wife is sleeping with his boss, and he's become cynical about law enforcement.  While buying a bottle of whiskey, a young kid comes in and snatches the booze, leading Kiefer on a footchase, and ultimately Kiefer falls through an opening in an abandoned warehouse and takes a pretty nasty fall.  Later, the kid who stole the bottle is brutally murdered.  It seems also that the fall may have awakened some kind of psychic ability in Sutherland, who can see the crimes happening, but not the killer, only the victim.  Whose eyes is Kiefer looking through?"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Worth Waiting For,"Upon my viewing of Zoo TV: Live in Sydney"" at the tender age of ten, it is secure to articulate that I was most enamored with U2.  Now being twenty-one years of age, this particular show still draws me.  Despite having been previously stated before in aforementioned reviews, U2 are unquestionably at their best.  That is not to declare that U2 attained their peak during the Zoo TV Tour, quite the contrary, for their tours succeeding have been and are just as extraordinary.  After it was announced that Zoo TV should finally be released onto DVD, a U2 fan such as I could not facilitate but express delight and make purchase with all haste.  I highly recommend this product.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"yes, finally","I was ecstatic when I heard this was coming to DVD. I remember attending a screening of this film when it came out in the mid-80's. I have always loved this movie. Sting is an incredible person; charming, funny, extremely talented. His persona as being the ""deep"", ""tortured"", arrogant rock star is so far from the truth. Having met and conversed with him a few times, I can say he is truly the reverse. He's kind and attentive. This film shows some of that certainly. And of course, for his first post-Police venture, the music and live performances are what you would expect from a man like Sting: incredible"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Routine story that is well done.,"My biggest problem with the movie is that everybody is happy and wins at the end. It is a competition, but they are no real losers. The good thing about it though, is that they did prepare the audience well. They didn't take the easy way out and have Akeelan lose by choice, they kept the integrity of the competition fairly intact."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Wonderful!!,I decided to purchased both part 1 and part 2 for my 2 year old who totally loves tractors and am I ever so glad that I did!!  He LOVES his tractor tapes!!!!  He now wants to watch them instead of The Wiggles.

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Learn from the best,This is an excellent tool for learning how to scratch. Qbert takes you through 30 chapters of different scratch techniques and teaches by matching his combo. He'll play and then you'll play and the lesson loops until you are ready to move along.

dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Magnificent Soap Opera,"I love this film.  Gregory Peck is marvelous in his ""everyman"" role, and is well supported by the rest of the fine cast.  Very good script, photography, and an atypically subdued score from Bernard Herrmann.  This picture makes a fine companion to the earlier THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES.  Whereas that picture dealt with servicemen returning home immediately after WWII and their problems adjusting to peacetime, THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT deals with one such individual a decade later."
dvd,,5.0,Great clean movie,I would highly recommend this movie to any individual with a family or who enjoys a good clean comedy. 
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,"Great, educational fun!","This is a great movie for children of all ages. My 19 month old son will watch this movie from beginning to end. He laughs and dances and even sings along. Not only is it fun, but educational too! So, if you need about 45 minutes to cook dinner or do some cleaning this movie might be helpful"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Great learning tool!,"This DVD is an excellent learning tool for parents, caregivers and babies!  Exactly what I was looking for to introduce sign language to our little one"
dvd,7 of 7,2.0,"Amazing movie, terrible ""remastering""","This is a review of the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition,"" NOT a review of the film itself. If you're considering the purchase of a two-disc special edition, you probably already know that the film is great; you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,An underrated gem that should've gotten more notice,"Monument Ave. is probably one of the best films I have ever seen. Instead  of the Hollywood happy ending, we have a dark and grim tale of family  morals and the loyalty between being a stand up guy and a family man. Denis  Leary proves he doesn't always have to play piss and moan roles and he's at  his best as the reluctant Bobby. The cast is excellent with Colm Meaney as  a remorseless crime boss, Ian Hart as Bobby's energetic friend, Famke  Janssen as Bobby's girlfriend, and the rest of the cast are in top form.  Director Ted Demme manages to get down to the bare nub of the script with  the Boston accents and attitudes. This film definitely should've gotten  more notice. Grade: A"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A Family Drama Set in a Courtroom,"There are really two kinds of lawyer films out there; the kind that is about the trial and the kind that is about the lawyers; this film is about the lawyers and the family drama of a father and daughter pitted against each other in a class action lawsuit.  The film is well constructed and acted, though there is the occasional corny dialoge in the father-daughter scenes that could have been written much stronger.  "
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Really creative stuff,"For those who are interested, this DVD will not disappoint.  Featuring some of the more noteworthy works from the Raymond Rohauer collection, this is an experience into cinema which is rather profound... and rapidly disappearing."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,"Unique, effective workout","This is a great workout.  I'm going to say that it borders on being cutting edge.  I know, that's not what most people think when they hear ""Denise Austin"", but at the very least, give some credit to her choreographer, Lisa Wheeler of Method fame.  This is a great workout that can get up your heart rate using yoga/fusion movements, traditional yoga and functional fitness."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,coming from her biggest fan...,"this is my favorite movie. i think it is really funny and has a good story to it. i admit that there are some stupid parts, but i think every movie has those. i think anybody who went to high school can relate to this movie. it has all of the hs stereotypes as characters. its one of those movies that makes you laugh, but it also has parts where you feel bad for the characters. i think jenna elfman and melissa joan hart give off excellent cameos and cant forget about jerry o'connell either. i think ethan embry (preston) does a great job in this movie and i think they did a terrific casting job as far as jennifer love hewitt playing amanda beckett, ""the dream girl"". you havent lived until you have seen this movie :"
dvd,2 of 4,1.0,I would rate this comdy zero stars if I could.,"I have to say I did not have too much faith to begin with that this was going to be a good movie.  However, the reviews I had read and the Blockbuster cashier all said it was a genuinely funny movie. My friends and I were ready for a good comedy. I suppose if you think that perpetual arguing and name calling and irresponsible behavior is hilarious then I suppose it could win an Oscar nomination. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A finely crafted film,"Other reviews will give the basic plot and characters, "
dvd,,4.0,Who could resist?,"I think I'll keep this one short.  First of all, 'Q' features a stop-motion animated flying serpent-dragon-thing terrorizing New York plus Michael Moriarty and David Carradine in the lead roles.  That alone should be sufficient to make you want to see this as far as I'm concerned.  As is typical of the Cohen films I've seen, 'Q' is particularly interested in character, moreso than in the supernatural elements.  It's almost a character study looking at Moriarty's Quinn, a fearful, paranoid small-time criminal who discovers the location of the murderous, resurrected Quetzacoatyl and his/her (?) nest and sees in this an opportunity to ransom the city.  Moriarty's jittery, method performance is quite amusing, and provides an interesting counterpoint to his most famous role as Stone in the early seasons of 'Law & Order'.  Hopefully you will find it amusing as well, as this makes up the bulk of the film.  Carradine plays the cop leading the investigation of the serpent murders, as well as some ritual homicides that are, naturally, connected.  His role is less important and less flashy, but I still like him a lot.  His ability to keep a straight face through out the proceedings is admirable."
dvd,10 of 10,4.0,"A well-done ""mockumentary"" with a superb cast.","Hilarious farce about a Glasgow hairdresser who comes to Los Angeles to compete in an international hairdressing competition.  Done in ""mockumentary"" style, there are cameo appearances by several real-life celebrities playing themselves, which adds to the illusion of reality.  Craig Ferguson, who also co-wrote the script, is outstanding in the lead role.  He is ably assisted by a first rate supporting cast, and a very funny script.  This movie this is a real hoot from beginning to end"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,'Survivor' Goes to the Urban Jungle,"'The Apprentice' should hardly be evaluated as the underdog of reality television.  Slickly, but sharply presented, it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that can't fail to enthrall a NYSE broker or an unfamiliar novice.  The elements are assembled expertly by 'Survivor' creator, Mark Burnett, and The Donald.  Editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success, but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama.  Alumni Bill Rancic in his autobiographical business memoir, called 'The Apprentice,' a game show.  Deference should be showed for his evaluation, but they could have fooled us.  It seems more like a simulation.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Yes, it is on widescreen",The widescreen version of Forever Young was released on LASER DISC.  And it is awesome!  I have it in my collection. Someone in their infinite wisdom probably decided it wasn't worth it to put that version on DVD.  They were so wrong

dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Multilayered existential horror,"This is a horror film that has stuck in my mind for several years.  I find I prefer horror films that use the ""evil"" as a metaphor for the world as it exists and that operate on multiple levels.  Richard Stanley successfully negotiates the political, including fallout of racism in South Africa and its occupation of Namibia.  He brings in tension between the modern world and the primitive world, as shown by an alienated lead character running from her husband and home towards an unknown destination, and a tired, suffering police officer chasing the monster, who must consult the shaman who lives on the margins of society, the new and the ancient, predating white colonization."
dvd,7 of 8,4.0,erotic and fun,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was pretty bad but it was still fun and very erotic! Unlike Surrender, they do not dub over the love making scenes with sound and you can actually hear the skin slap together and the ladies moan. There are two decent lesbian scenes (though they lack in comparison to the final scene in Femalien). The one where Genie is chained up had a lot of potential until the goofball male genie interupted their ""fun."" In fact if not for the male Genie, I would have given this sucker five stars!!"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,TMNT - Original Series (Season 1),"The first 5 episodes of the series, which complete the first season, and 4 bonus episodes that were never aired.. that are from the 10th season made in 1996. The only bad thing about that is that I don't have the 10th season, so I was watching them without knowing what was going on. I'm gonna have to wait a looong time for the 9th and 10th season to come out on DVD"

His speach following the murder in the cargo-hold is one of the most inspirational moments in all cinema.

However, Ridley Scott took his approach to this story that if handled by anyone else would have ended up probably like any other 80's action flick. The story follows a renegade cop played by Michael Douglas and his partner played by Andy Garcia as they travel to Japan to deliver a convicted Japanese murderer back to the Japanese police to be imprisoned. When they arrive they are met by the police and hand over the prisoner, but things aren't that easy. The seemingly legit police officers were actually in disguise, and now Nick and Charlie clash with the Japanese culture and with their assigned guide from the Japanese police played by Ken Takakura."
dvd,,5.0,The Book of Acts Video,"A very good portrayal of the book of Acts, very true to the scriptures and a great visual aid.  My church has greatly enjoyed viewing and discussing this video.  I highly recommend it. "
dvd,2 of 15,1.0,"Good try, but didn't do it for me","I do respect what they are trying to do in this movie, but it doesn't come to fruition in my opinion. It is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all, but I am not sure you will want to after the first viewing....I didn't. This is a movie that had great potential, but in my opinion it never reached it. You may disagree."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A Very Imaginative Series,"I enjoyed Jeremiah - The Complete First Season totally. I might be a little bit too much into Sci-Fi or Apocalypse type movies, but this series contains something more - some guesses on human nature in time of crises, and of course some cliches are also present. At the end it left me with a lot of yearning for the Second Season - which is still not available on DVD. It sort of feels like injustice has been committed"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,"Science Fiction spoofed, but done better than most anyway.","`The Fifth Element', directed by Luc Besson and starring hero Bruce Willis and my favorite heavy, Gary Oldman is something of an enigma to me, because in spite of its high powered stars, excellent story, and strong direction, I took practically no notice of it when it first came out in the theatre. My hypothesis is that part of this excellent movie's problem is that it is a cross of at least three genres, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and satire. The best illustrations of the last genre is Mel Brooks' `Young Frankenstein' and that great cult hit `Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Both are so well realized that they almost work as true horror movies, if it weren't for the fact that they were even better spoofs and comedies."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,One Of The Best Films Of The Year,"While I found the book ""An Ordinary Man"" somewhat boring and slow, the movie adaptation is, for lack of a better word, extraordinary. Don Cheadle gives an astounding performance as Paul Rusesabagina, who is the manager of the Mille Collines hotel. During the Rwandan genocide in the 90s, Rusesabagina provides shelter in the Mille Collines for hundreds of refugees. Like others have noted, one of the best aspects of this film is that it ends with hope, unlike other depressing true stories of genocide. No one can afford to miss this film"

dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Fabulous,"Fabulous and exciting is all I can say. I was mesmerised by Peaches and Herbs doing their all time favourite, Reunited and many more. I thought it was just out of this world. I gave the DVD a rating of 4 in that I believe there's room for improvement, especially in controlling the sound levels from the audience who sometimes swallow the performers. Overall this is a must have for any collector of soul music"
dvd,1 of 4,2.0,Euuuwww......Creepy!,"This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking ""Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?"" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!"

But I'm glad that I bought it.  Balance Ball for Beginners has different movements in it and there were almost no repeat exercises from her previous videos.  The DVD also has chapters which not all exercise DVD's have, so you can do one or two segments at a time.  A practical purchase for a beginner as well"
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Don't get me wrong...,"...I'm a huge John Wayne fan, but this movie has some serious shortcomings, including some of the acting by the cast and portrayals that, while acceptable at the time, are not so well received today.  I won't knock John Wayne's acting, however, because he performed it as only John Wayne could.  But some of the other acting was downright daffy, like when the singing Eddie Powers (William Frawley) was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine.  ... The Fighting Seabees wasn't a totally bad movie, and I thought the formation of the SeaBees (if this movie is accurate) was very interesting.  But some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better"
dvd,20 of 22,5.0,Great Start for Pilates, I've been doing Yoga daily for 9 years and just recently started to have an interest in incorporating Pilates into my practice.
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Never Fall in Love Again,"A stunning film made famous by Marlene Dietrich but carried largely by the fantastic performance of Emil Jennings.  The stodgy professor gives up everything to be with his blue angel and pays the ultimate price for it.  This is a story of the road to ruin as seen through a travelling cabaret.  Pay special attention to the clown in the opening scenes.  His face says it all.  This is a haunting film that is one of the gems of Weimar German productions.  It is nice to have both the German and American versions, but the subtitled German version is the one you want to watch"
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,Mr. Deeds,"Gary Cooper plays Longfellow Deeds, the greeting card poet from Mandrake Falls, Vermont, who inherits 20 million dollars from his uncle, comes to NYC, and becomes the laughingstock of the big city. When he decides to give all the money away to out-of-work farmers (it's Depression time, remember), he is declared insane by lawyers who want some of the pie for themselves, citing his tuba playing, walking in the rain, chasing fire engines, etc. as examples. "
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Great Characters and Performances Overcome Story's Weak Points,"John Travolta's role as Vincent Vega in ""Pulp Fiction"" would launch not only a major comeback in his movie career - but would also start a streak of money-making and well-received movies that he would star in.  One of the first movies in that streak that would follow-up ""Pulp Fiction"" would be ""Get Shorty"".    In ""Get Shorty"", Travolta stars as Chili Palmer - a collector for a Miami loan-shark who aspires to get into the movie business.  This role seemed tailor-made for Travolta.    It brings a solid cast to carry out the storyline - and they succeed in doing so.   While ""Get Shorty"" will entertain you and still is a good movie, ultimately I still find some weaknesses with the movie as a whole."
dvd,0 of 4,1.0,Couldn't be more wrongerererer,"As stated in other reviews, this movie is a joke.  Granted the cinematography is good, and there's excitement, but if you film a pig flying and have good cinematography and story, you'd get the same 'excitement'.  I also am in Army aviation, and it's disappointing to have such a deviation from the truth filmed.  Many movies make some adjustments that border on reality and some go outside that boundary.  This movie transcends to another plane of existence and commits suicide.  If I were an actor and offered a role in this movie, I would have run away knowing the repercussions it would have on my career. "

dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Great fun,"    I can watch this movie a lot without ever getting tired of it. It has a great talented young cast and they all shine. I especially like the under-rated and underappreciated Timothy Olyphant ""why isn't this guy a big star already ???"" as a drug dealer. He steals the show every time he's on screen ""which isn't enough"" and it makes me wish he was in it more. He also has good chemestry with Katie ""I Love Tom Cruise"" Holmes in their small scenes together."
dvd,,5.0,Seinfeld continues to shine,"The Seinfeld show managed to create a substantial number of episodes that are true classics. They seem to become funnier with each viewing; kind of a mini-event. Normally I find commentary features to be either disapointing or distracting. This is not the case here. Occasionally, even Larry David offers a remark or two. There are additional featurettes about individual episodes where the cast, writers and crew supply their own highly original observations."

dvd,0 of 4,5.0,From Darwing to God.,"From Darwing to God. This piece is an excellent work to track evolution. It starts with the Darwing's revolutionary ideas of evolution. Presents the cycles of extintions and emergences of species, having humans the roll of the last potential species to trigger the next mass extinction in the history of life on earth. The transformation of species as a result of its interation with their environment, is as well shown, having us, humans, involved in a battle between organisms. This is discussied under the threat of microorganisms to our own existence, bringing to the viewer instances from the real life. Finally, the documentary shows the battle between creationism and evolution. The struggle humans have with these new ideas of evolution and the existence of God. In order to overcome this paradoxe, a new idea of an intelligent life is proposed. This new concept states the existence of an entity embedded in the universe, as the creator and responsible of this magnificent universe."
dvd,,2.0,What was I watching?,"Was I watching the same show as everyone who wrote reviews on here? I just finished the 3rd season having loved the first two. I was so disapointed in this season I'm really not sure I can even give the show another chance with season 4. The show completely runied all of the characters. They introduced new people who were either completely shrill and unbearable (Moira/Max, Billie) or bland and pointless (Angus). And then there's Jenny. The writers continued in their quest to create the most unlikeable, cringe-worthy, annoying character in the history of television. This is nothing against Mia Kirshner who is lovely and does well with what she's given but after 3 seasons the writers still can't seem to figure out what to make of the character. It might make more sense if she was treated as some sort of pariah by those around her but all of the other characters seem to love her so.....what are they seeing that I'm not? Her actions make no sense, her relationships make no sense even for a crazy person. As for the sex, someone actually thought they reeled the sex in this season? I never minded it in the past but sweet Lord!!! By the end of the season I felt like I was watching Cinemax After Dark! It was insanse! Grown adults do not start pulling off their clothes and fondling each other when mother is right outside the door!!!!! Especially when mom said she would be right back!!!!!!!"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,We all need a friend ,"Ten year old fatherless Elliot has the ideal friend in the harmless little extraterrestial E.T. who has been left inadverentely behind by his spaceship. E. T. gets to know Elliot's brother and sister and in effect becomes a member of the family. The real heart- jerking comes when E.T. dies, and is then at hearing from his own Civilization, resurrected. This special little cinematic miracle works wonders on the viewers heart, and the movie has a moving and inspiring ending. "

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"""i'm as mad as hell and i'm not going to take this anymore!""","Network tells the story of Howard Beale, an aclaimed TV anchor who recives notice he will be fired in two weeks due to poor ratings, leading him to anounce he will commit suicide in one week. when this is announced, the media goes into a frenzy and suddenly the ratings are through the roof and Howard Beale becomes a cultural obbsession. Network does what it does best, completly poke fun at the news buisness and never deviates from it. all the performences are supurb, the two standouts being Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway. Peter Finch as Howard Beale is full of energy and when he does those onscreen rantes he is at top form. Dunaway perfectly embodies the extremly cold-hearted media head Diana Christensen. there are also small gems to be found in the film, most notably Beatrice Straight as the neglected wife of news program head Max Shumacher. though she's on screen for little under six minutes, her performance just sticks with you through out the film. respectivly, all three of these actos took home an oscar that year (the first since A Streetcar Named Desire). it has also become a classic and is apart of AFI's top 100 movies. so if you truley want to see a great film with great acting, this is the one for you. it may even have you sticking out your head through the window and yelling ""i'm as mad as hell and i'm not going to take this anymore!"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Help for guys, indie film Four Dead Batteries","If you haven't heard about this film, you are missing out. I am a guy that lives on Horror/scifi movies and british comedy. I am not the type to normally sit through a chick flick but this movie is a definite exception. I give it a 9 out of 10 rating. It has the casual humor of a comedy but the serious tone underneath that most women expect in a romantic comedy. The big difference that makes it an enjoyable movie for guys  like me is that it is told from a guys point of view. I could honestly relate to all the trials that the characters went through in their relationships and that is what made it so funnny. The movie centers on 4 improv comedy troupe members, all with different relationship styles and obvious problems. Guys, If your girl is always wanting you to watch this type of movie but you can't stand it, go rent or buy this for her, watch it with her, and I bet that you both will enjoy this movi"

dvd,,5.0,Don't blow it off,"Having glanced at the other customer reviews, I'm surprised at the lukewarm ones.  I'm in my mid-40s and my husband is in his late 50s.  We're certainly no prudes, but at first I was hesitant to rent ""Blow Dry"" because of the title and cover photo (I thought it might fall into the popular crude-humor category geared toward teens and young adults).  Nevertheless, I went ahead and rented it; after reading the plot synopsis, I thought the movie might be somewhat similar to other quirky comedies we've loved (""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Saving Grace"", and of course, ""The Full Monty"").  I was right, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  OK, Hartnett's accent is neither perfect nor consistent, but so what?  And we certainly didn't expect it to be a heavy, ""important"" movie, so finding it to be a delightfully fresh comedy more than satisfied us.  Alan Rickman was super, as were the other actors.  Just approach it in a spirit of lightheartedness and fun and you'll be pleased. P.S. Although ""Blow Dry"" isn't just about hair, we're planning to give our hairdresser the DVD for Christmas, and we feel sure she'll love it"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,A high water mark for journalism and film,"One of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist.  Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States.  Redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed.  He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics.  "
dvd,26 of 27,5.0,The greatest dance team we've ever seen or are ever likely to see,"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers comprised what is without compare the greatest dance team in the history of cinema. Even today the pair represents the height of romantic elegance, and their dancing together still generates an onscreen excitement that has been seen since. Tragically, the Astaire-Rogers films have not previously been available on DVD, but this first of two sets will make all of their films available to the public. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,One Of Chaplin's Best; Certainly Underrated,"I enjoyed this a lot more the second time when I could see it on a very clear DVD print. I don't know why that would make a difference with the story, but it did as I found it very good for the entire distance, although that's just a scant 69 minutes.  The special two-disc edition does this film justice."

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,GOOD SHORTS...MORE DISNEY DUPLICATION THOUGH,"Disney is releasing yet another wave of DVD shorts which can be a positive or a negative.  From a negative point of view, several of these shorts can already be found in the Disney Treasures Mickey in Color sets 1 or 2 or the Disney Treasures Pluto set.  So if you have those then there really isn't a lot of value in buying this set.  On the other hand, a few of the shorts are not on those sets and haven't been released on DVD as of yet.  This gets right down to the problem with Disney.  I don't know why they didn't do the Mickey shorts in chronological order like they did with Donald Duck.  Of course, it's more than likely an insidious plot on their part to make us spend even more money.  That will be up to you to determine if this set is worth $15 to get only four shorts that are new.  If you own the Disney Treasures sets, I would say no, unless you're a completist."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,ANTHONY HOPKINS PUTS ON AN ACTING CLINIC,"MEET JOE BLACK has a lot going for it. Brad Pitt for one. Anthony Hopkins for another. Mr. Hopkins, arguably our greatest living actor, puts on an acting clinic in MEET JOE BLACK that should be required viewing by every drama student. Every inflection in his voice, every gesture, every expression is rich with theatrical meaning. He gives a masterful performance. Pitt is no slouch in this either. It is like dueling actors, the old and the young. Throw in two more things. Claire Forlani plays Hopkin's daughter who falls for Pitt (poor girl!). She has a face that is beautifully tragic or tragically beautiful; whether she is smiling or frowning, she seems about to cry. She gives a stunning performance and adds a major dimension as the love interest. The other is that, if you like modern art, you will love the abstract paintings shown prominently in MEET JOE BLACK. The collection of paintings add an unusually strong input from a competing visual medium. Oh, and did I say that the production values are good? A love story involving life and death and how to live life. MEET JOE BLACK is a winner. See it, rent it, own it. They don't make too many like this one. Highly recommended."

Anyone interested in animation or those wacky 60s and 70s should make this required viewing.  The jokes are a little stale now, but were they ever that fresh anyway.  Who cares!!! It's Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman.  Sit (way)back and enjoy"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"Reese and Patricia, and how","There were a couple of aspects of this movie that were a little too neat and packaged, like how Reese'es character's dad changes overnight and such.  But I have to say that this movie was riveting to me.  I have never before seen Patricia Arquette and I was just astounded.  Her performance is absolutely superb.  To me, a book or movie is great, when I literally feel like I have become a person in the story, and feel everything that person feels.  That is why this movie is so great.  Patricia's character is that person in this movie, at least to me.  I am an absolute fan of Reese Witherspoon, so I couldn't be too objective as I love everything about her and she is great in this movie as always.  Her character really shows the love of a true friend to the abused girl.  I cannot imagine anyone watching this movie and not enjoying it.  It is a truly heartwarming story.  I will watch it again and again.  If you like it, check out &quot;The Man in the Moon.&quot"

But, when, oh when will producers try and at least act like music lovers as opposed to trying tio impress with every damn angle they can find? On this particular dvd one is actually treated to viewing the back of some members of the audience's head; then of cousre we must not forget that all of us absolutely love seeing guitar players from the rear, behind their arms, the drummer from ground zero postion, from behind his drum kit, etc, etc. The day a producer locates a decent wide-angle camera and tries to position himself in the centre of the audience in a slightly raised vantage point and helps us view the show as if we were sitting in the centre, taking in as much of the four, five or six members at once the happier I will be. I am not really interested to watch the audience either when Steve or Larry are in the middle of a solo. Get real guys!"

dvd,9 of 9,5.0,WHEW!!!  This Is A Great Workout!  Be Prepared to Work!,"Once again, thinking that I was in great shape, I added yet another workout to my library to ""mix things up.""  Part of my workout routine includes alternating upper and lower body workouts within my usual routines, and since I have discovered ""Karen Voight,"" I thought I would try her ""Great Weighted Workout.""  The DVD allows one to ""mix and match"" routines, which work out to be approximately 35-40 minutes per upper or lower body, or do the entire workout, which is about 80 minutes.  I had only been doing the ""mix and match,"" which are pretty challenging in themselves, but finally decided to do the entire routine.  WHEW!  Because of the intensity of doing the ""upper"" and ""lower"" workouts, I knew the workout would be tough, and it is.  I would not recommend this workout for beginners because of the intensity and fast pace, but if one is a beginner, one may want to ""mix and match"" and either begin with very light weights (dumbbells, ankle weights and a small body ball are used), or no weights at all until one is comfortable moving up a notch."

Towles "" Nostalgia Fan ""; Thank God for an African American who finally sees this show for what it is and reports that he feels so highly about Amos and Andy. It ""erks"" me to see so many people putting this show down, based on the fact that they feel it puts the African American race in a bad light. Mr. Towles sees what any thinking person sees, that this is a wonderfully funny show, with wonderful and talented actors who deserve to be watched and enjoyed by present day audiences as it was by past audiences. As he says, there are many shows now and in the recent past which are  similar to Amos and Andy, in content, and which have never been treated like this show. Bill Cosby went on a crusade to try and keep this show from being seen on TV, and it looks as if he will be successful for all time to come. Thank God for their release on DVD."

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Great Movie! Great Message!,"This film is a wonderful story that takes the viewer on an emotional and spiritual journey as its protagonist (Nevada Smith) goes on a calculated hunt to find and exact revenge on his parents' three brutal murderers. He's warned early on by a friend (Brian Keith) that he'll eventually become like the people he's after. A heartbreaking scene, in the backwaters of Louisiana, underscores that the prediction is coming true. There, as he hears a stunning rebuke from an indignant Suzanne Pleshette (who gives a great performance here), the realization begins to dawn upon our hero that he is not as righteous as he (or we) suppose. "
dvd,,4.0,Classic in its own right,"I dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980's or have gone to school in the United States but I can still relate to this movie. This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied."

It was more challenging and also had several excersizes I had not tried before with the ball. I reccomend this for beginners and up
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Breath-taking and elegant,"Oh my, where to start? I only recently saw this film due to a mild enamorment with the lovely Emma Thompson and boy am I glad I did. Being fairly unfamiliar with Merchant and Ivory productions, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of research that must've gone in to the producing of this film. The sets are just enormously fabulous, with rich colors and impeccable detail. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,it's not about the acting...,"Two of my best friends were living their last days when Philadelphia was made. One of them went to the Dr. whose office was used in the opening scenes, and was receiving an experimental drug that was the precursor to today's more successful cocktails. I watched them struggle at a time when Reagan wouldn't even say the word AIDS to the public. Bush wasn't much better. So to have a film come out that tried its best to tackle the most tragic disease in our lifetime, one that touched me personally, well, I was and am willing to forgive a couple of shortcomings. It was a monumental film for anyone struggling with AIDS, and for those who helped support them, giving us all one of the first voices that permeated the psyche of our country, beyond the boundaries of NY and SF."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,McNamara's Not-Quite Confession... and for good reason  ,"My first glimpse of Errol Morris' work (The Thin Blue Line) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role (and subsequent fallacy) of human memory in historical discourse.  While ""The Thin Blue Line"" examined a singular Texas murder, Morris' ""Fog of War"" has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old McNamara and his position in United States war policy over a thirty year span.  World War II and Vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary, but the ""larger footprint"" of Morris' film rests with the controversial nature of McNamara in the public's mind versus the historical record.  In short, McNamara bears some responsibility (and perhaps lingering guilt) for his recommendations in the WWII bombing and the Vietnam policy.  The Vietnam War was not his action alone, however; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act:  The President of the United States.  Accordingly, McNamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition.  Yet, he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the Vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the Kennedy/Johnson Era (as well as the WWII bombing decisions).  McNamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the American public want a criminal confession from the man.  "
dvd,,5.0,Tour de Force,"Yes there have been concept albums before and after this one but ""The Wall"" had an intense impact on the psyche of millions of kids around the world like no other album.

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Very good movie,"I loved it when I first saw it and I love it now. Purchased the Collector's Edition, very nice extras - some a little corny to watch but still very good if your into this movie.

Not your typical action flick, deffinately a must see"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Classic, timeless fun!","My children sit riveted to this old movie.  They simply love it.  I had rented it a couple of times, and finally decided it was worth owning.  I love the good old-fashioned values...no swearing, nudity, sexual innuendos, or gratuitous violence.  Nothing for parents to worry about here!   This version is colorized, fyi, for those children who might be black-and-white-phobic. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,STILL a GREAT season...,"It's not ""Just OK"", as someone else wrote. While some episodes are more enjoyable than others, I laughed so hard at times while watching this that I couldn't catch my breath. I definitely recommend this set, as well as all the others.

dvd,,4.0,The Collective Victory,"This is a good movie by a great director.  Anyone who has ever seen ""Battleship Potemkin"" has seen the genius of Sergei Eisenstein.  He has made other movies of greatness as well.  However, he was challenged by the limits of Communist censorship which should allow us to place an asterisk by any of his movies that come up short.  ""Alexander Nevsky"" is an excellent example of the good that can still emerge from the limitations that Eisenstein was dealing with.  It is a movie that tells of an earlier time in Russian history when the people rose up to repel an invading Germanic army.  It was made in 1939 at a time when the Soviets knew that Nazi Germany was a real threat to become another invading Germanic army.  "
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,It's no Citizen Kane,"I found this film accidentially on Amazon and was curious because I know Welles didn't complete a great deal of films.  His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer.  The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad.  It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly.  I did not shell out of the Criterion edition, which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film"
dvd,,5.0,"Even with only the Good parts, much discussion can happen","I saw this movie when I was 11, now I'm in my 30's and it still invokes wonder.  I also have always loved the humor of this tale.  I love seeing Fred Savage become interested in the story as his grandfather(Peter Falk) reads it to him.  It makes me nostalgic because my own grandparents and parent read to me when I was sick.  "
dvd,10 of 11,1.0,Reconsider before you buy...,"I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible. "
dvd,,5.0,GREAT SUMMARY OF CORPORATE CRIME,"Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms.  More importantly, this documentary shows how the American criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations.  As a result of the aforementioned, I use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Nostalgia and cult classics.,"I can remember when my local tv station would run this movie once a year on sunday mornings, and occasionally late friday nights when it was basically out of options.   At its time, this movie had great special effects.  Also as far as a disney production, this movie explores some very dark themes, as well as developing an incredible storyline.  Unfortunately poor acting and slightly slow pacing prevented this title from reaching a huge audience like modern fantasy movies.  Dragonslayer is an essential reference for any study of the history of fantasy moviemaking.  As a unique storline made before everything coming out of hollywood followed formulaic principiles, this movie is an absolute gem.  I highly reccommend this movie for viewers with refined tastes."
dvd,,4.0,Great Tidbits,"I didn't love everything about this film.  In fact, the first time I saw it, I felt it was lacking in depth.  But the second time I watched it, many little moments shone through and I saw the depth of emotion being prtrayed."

I am too young to have seen these performances originally and all I've ever seen our clips or perhaps one complete song performed by the Beatles."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,You will definitely get your money's worth and then some. ,"To me, The Office is one of those shows that people either love or hate. This past summer I became familiar with the show by catching the reruns of the 2nd season on NBC. After watching just one full episode, I was hooked. I continued to tune in each week to watch the reruns and ended up buying season 1 a few weeks later. I watched that DVD repeatedly and decided that I had to buy the 2nd season as soon as it was available on DVD. I've watched both seasons a countless number of times. The episodes never stop being funny no matter how many times you watch them. At least that's how it is in my case. I know most of the people who will read this review will have probably already seen the show and might be as big of a fan of it as I am, but I cannot express enough what an amazing show this is. The writing and the comedic timing are beyond words. I hope to see this show last for at least 5 seasons.  "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Fun - but not easy: Dance like no one's watching! (warning: bad music),"I'm not the most coordinated person; I found this video difficult to learn. BUT had a great time, just moving my ""best guess,"" in the meantime. I get so crazy with videos that explain to you for an entire minute while you are frozen and just waiting to get on with it. Paula Abdul just jumps right in and you have to sink or swim. Disadvantage is that it will take a few viewings before you can accurately emulate these moves. Which can be seen as an incentive to use this video again and again. It is now part of my regular rotation, and each time I put it in it's a challenge to get up to speed...but a fun time while I struggle with my coordination challenges. I mean, we're at home, right? I'd never brave a class like this in reality ... but can freely embarass myself over laughter at home."

dvd,,2.0,Boring and quite uneven,"The three stories are quite uneven, being the Wan Kar Wai's segment the most interesting: well acted, well photographed and with a kind of catchy story line. However, the other too are a wonderful invitation to sleep. The Steven Soderbergh tale is awfully dull and nothing really interesting happens. The Antonioni piece is the most disappointing one, not only for being the worst but for being Anyonioni's. It's absolutely pointless and confusing; in many instances, it seems to be an amateurish test from a lazy cinema student. It's a pity it's Antonioni's since his reputation deserves more than this. Only for the Wan Kar Wai piece, I give this movie 2 stars"
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,Don Johnson is a revelation,"I actually bought this DVD because of Virginia Madsen having just seen ""Sideways"".  I won't re-hash the plot as Amazon has already provided potential buyers with the outline. However, while Madsen and all members of the cast were great Don Johnson was the real revelation here. His acting was nothing short of superb in a complex part that required him to demonstrate wide emotional range from slick cynicism to tenderness, to the homicidal rage/grief and abject confusion of a smart operator who's been thoroughly out played. Looks plus smarts plus intention equal sex appeal. No wonder the women fought over him. "

dvd,10 of 19,5.0,"Yes, but what about the DVD case(s)?","I give this five stars because the film is superb and there are some very nice special features on this new reissue - however, I have some complaints about the actual packaging of the discs. Rather than follow the route of Casablanca, Treasure of the Sierra Madre and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with the WB ""cardboard"" fold-out cases, which feel similar to Criterion DVDs and are higher quality, ""Maltese Falcon"" is just a standard DVD container with three smaller DVD cases inside - the same type of cheap, plastic DVD cases HBO began using for their DVDs of television shows a few years ago. They're the same as the ""Arrested Development Season One"" discs - it works for television shows because it's a bit easier to maintain, but I honestly think these are very annoying for films and they just don't appear to be as high quality as the standard WB classic reissues from the past few years."
dvd,3 of 9,5.0,Half Japanese,Must see DVD
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,This is a good classic movie. Better than some crap today!,"This movie is great. I remember watching it when I was really young. Im 21 now and still love it. Yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great. Its not suppose to be realistic. Its fiction! I just realized too that the daughter is the girl from American Pie which makes it even funnier. Overall this movie is pretty good. If you dont care for the story, atleast get it to see Kim and the other chicks in the movie. If you've never seen the movie, just buy it. Its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it. For all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues!   "
dvd,12 of 12,4.0,"Shamefully Overlooked Southern Gothic Murder Mystery Has Atmosphere, Genuine Thrills and the Superb Blanchett","This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Great movie,"Japanese horror films never disappoint me. This movie is sure to make you scream or at least be grossed out. However, I will say that the ending leaves you confused and thinking ""What just happened"". Even if it all falls apart at the end, it is a solid horror film."

dvd,,4.0,ZOMBIES INVADE THE UK!!!,"I admit, I am a ""johnny-come-lately"" (to drag out a very old expression) in the whole ""zombie"" phenom, and I hope the ignorance of my comments don't offend all the loyal, hardcore zombie loyalists out there - but lately, the world is being over-run by zombies, so it has become something we all need to take seriously.  Of course, I saw all the earlier movies as they came out, so I'm not totally ignorant, but my tastes run in all directions (usually at the same time) so I would watch them, and then move on to the next movie.  It's become very clear that many people latched on to these movies, and then went on to devote their entire lives to this genre - which is fine, for them.  ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of those movies that I watch, but I don't really form a complete opinion, so I'll watch it again, and again, and again...and you know what?  I really, really like it!  It IS funny - NOT in the way I have been accustomed to viewing humor, and not really in the British/Monty Python/Fawlty Towers/Young Ones kind of way that I have acquired a taste for over the years.  The humor IS dry and it is very much ""tongue-in-cheek"", but it is also a little more sophisticated and intelligent than the ""Dead Polly Parrot"" sketch (which is STILL very funny).  I've read that this movie was put together and intended as an ""homage"" to the American father of the zombie movement - George Romero (I hope I got that right).  The people who get hung up on gore and can't get past it, will criticize this as being just another one of those ""bloody, senseless, body count movies"" - to me, that is just being very small minded.  This is a movie, those are special effects, NO ONE really dies in these movies - if they can grasp that, we can move on.  To me it becomes - what NEW twist can we come up with, what NEW method of dispatching someone?  The more elaborate, the grossest, the most shocking, the most original - that is what takes the prize, and that is where the humor comes in.  No one is laughing over death and destruction - this is zombie movie mayhem and the object is to come up with something never before seen, so the audience will freak out in the delight that comes with being caught by surprise.  This movie is a very respectable British entry into the zombie genre - with it's own twist.  I'm sure it will take it's place with all the other recent movies - ""Day of the Dead"", ""Land of the Dead"", ""28 Days"" - to name a few.  As I said, I'm a newcomer as a serious viewer of these movies, but as I begin to appreciate them and their unique humor, I am also adding them to my collection.  Thanks for taking the time to read"
dvd,0 of 1,2.0,A Few Laughs But An Overall Dissapointment,"Stranger with Candy was a good TV show but didnt translate well into a movie.    The story line was stupid like the show but stupid is the word to remember here, not funny.  The movie was a bit painful to sit through and felt like it dragged on about an hour too long.  It was cool that they got a lot of the original cast to rejoin for the movie, but the magic just wasnt there"

When there, they realize that the Pegagus Galaxy has a lot to offer, including a brand new life-sucking enemy known as the Wraith, as well as left over Ancient technology that will help make their lives easier. The only problem is that the Atlantis team has no contact with Earth and are on their own until they can find a way to contact their home.

dvd,,5.0,The best was yet to come!,"I have loved all the previous seasons of Queer as Folk, taking a lot of trouble to import the early season tapes and later DVD's into the UK.  I am only half way through watching the final season but am hooked already.  I was concerned that it would be too nostalgic and mushy, taking the cutting edge off the final season but how wrong could I be!  The final season takes you to the precipice of suspense and drama but as always with that subtle touch of humour to bring you back to reality.  I have always been cynical of ""safe"" American TV and its fear of the Bible bashing happy clappy's but the final season of Queer as Folk takes you to the edge.  Forget any moral dilemma or you'll get left far behind, enjoy the roller coaster ride of the final season and I'm looking forward to getting back to the TV to view the rest of the season."

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,An Early Talkie Still Fascinates.,"I choose to keep this brief since there are so many reviews. I do agree that the aviation scenes and the Zeppelin scenes are what make ""Hell's Angels"" a classic film. It is worth seeing. It was the story between the two brothers and Helen portrayed by the very young Jean Harlow that was remade. Hughes could not use actress Greta Nissen since she had a strong Norwegian accent. It is rather ironic since the actors are supposed to be British and none of them sound anything but American. "
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,One of Allen's best...,"I'm a huge Allen fan, but I realize that he's the type of director that some people never appreciate no matter how much I try to convince them.  This movie doesn't change that:  you'll probably love it if you like Allen, but if he always annoys you, then you shouldn't expect anything different."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"A Powerful Jackson Helps ""Carter"" Transcend Its Cliches--A Study Of Two Recent Basketball Underdog Stories","Oh, the sports movie.  The underdog victorious.  There are lots of cliches in film, but nothing quite compares to the formulaic telling of the inspirational, crowd-pleasing sports story.  Having seen two recent films set in the world of competitive basketball--I've realized the ""game"" is not always the thing.  While generally these films can build tension with slow motion photography and good music montages, it's a rare movie that can overcome its limitations to really stand apart from the dozens of similar stories."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Fitting Tribute To The Rabid Wolverine,"This is a DVD tells the story of Chris Benoit.  The story starts off from his childhood to his early days of training in Calgary in the dungeon.  It moves on to his time in New Japan and how his friendship with Guerrero & Malenko started along with his competing in the Super J Cup and the story behind him going from the name Pegasus Kid to Wild Pegasus.  His ECW time discussed how breaking Sabu's neck got him prepared for ""sports entertainment"" in the U.S. along with his feuding with 2 Cold Scorpio & the story behind his leaving ECW.  His WCW section talks about his feud & backstage problems with Kevin Sullivan, the best of 7 series with Booker T, the story behind the Owen Hart tribute match with Bret Hart, and the story behind him winning the WCW title only to walk out the next night.  And the last section covers his time in the WWE starting with his entrance with the Radicalz, feuding with Kurt Angle, a funny story behind his match with The Rock at Fully Loaded.  The DVD starts to close on his neck injury, the road to recovery, his Royal Rumble victory and him winning the title at WrestleMania XX.  "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Splendor In The Grass, Glory In The Flower, Nothing Can Bring Back The Hour","Opening on a glorious shot of a waterfall and a passionate lip-lock between raven-haired beauty Natalie Wood and boyishly handsome Warren Beatty in an old-fashioned car, the ambivalent need to succumb to temptation but wanting to be good - ""Don't Bud - no!"" Elia Kazan's masterpiece of adolescent longing, self-discovery and suppression is a fabulous experience. The hypocritical society that stifles young Deanie Loomis (Wood), drilling that no nice girl indulges or thinks about natural sexual desires and impulses, while young men are free to pursue their lust, but not with any virtuous girls. Deanie, daughter of a working-class family, is madly in love with Bud Stamper (Beatty, in his debut), the son of the wealthiest clan in town, and star of the school's athletic teams. Their romance is doomed by their parents' interference and control. Bud can't continue the relationship with all the pressure placed on him by his domineering father, Ace (Pat Hingle), not to mention the presence of his nymphomaniac, flapper sister, Ginny (Barbara Loden, who, at this time, was Mrs. Elia Kazan). Deanie's mother (Audrey Christie) constantly shadows her daughter, discouraging her from any impure thoughts or actions. After their breakup, Bud gets his release from the most promiscuous girl in school, and this devastates Deanie, who feels that she has to go bad to regain his love and attention. At a school dance, she copies Ginny's seductive style, and attempts to seduce Bud to get him back. He turns her down, leading Deanie to the reservoir where her nervous breakdown explodes, and she is sent to a sanitarium to recuperate. Bud then has to find himself, while Deanie must heal to regain her sanity and sense of self-worth."
dvd,14 of 15,4.0,"IT'S NO &quot;ANALYZE THIS&quot;, BUT FUN ROMP THRU A DOOZY SITUATION","Witty theme, darker than you'd expect and with some dead-serious undertones (Burt Young's character, for example, is *scary* without a trace of humor) but this is totally appropriate in context and gives the movie a punch that many comedies lack. Hugh Grant's comic timing took me by surprise, as did Jeanne T's convincing rendition of a mafia don's daughter. James Caan was actually the reason I picked this DVD up and did not regret it. Very worthy spin for an evening if you like atypical comedies in general or mafia comedies in particular"

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Book 1 Vol. 3,"Being a college student has its ups and downs...one of those ups being when you're not stuck in front of the computer for hours on end (or in my case, wrapped up in books and scripts) it allows you to find some quality programming-and I'm not talking about American Idol and Laguna Beach. Surprisingly, I used to come home after class and find Avatar on all the time. At first, it was just another annoying cartoon-until I took a closer look. This series is great for families and people of all ages. The main characters are faced with many challenges that help represent many of the moral values kids miss out on these days by watching other shows. It is a fantastic parenting tool as well as being highly entertaining. Much of the comedy is directed at the younger audience, but somehow manages not to be patronizing to the older audience. It even has many of the characters loved by people of all generations-pirates, bandits, and warriors-while including a bit of history in the process. Overall, the animation is marvelously done, the voices are very fitting, and the scripts are very well written. I would highly recommend this"
dvd,6 of 11,2.0,The Floozie Workout,"A more apt description of this video would be ""The Floozie Workout.""

dvd,0 of 4,1.0,Blecchh (warning - spoiler ahead),"This was an awful movie.  The premise was an obvious rip off an Outer Limits episode (Straight and Narrow), but I was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a feature-length format.  I was sadly disappointed.  The film eliminated everything that was interesting about the Outer Limits episode, and instead filled itself with...nothing.  In the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the ""bad guys"" about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect.  By the time the credits rolled, I was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea, when properly executed, and I don't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers.  To sum up: don't watch this movie.  It's bad.  Watch the 1990's Outer Limits episode, ""Straight and Narrow,"" starring Ryan Philippe, instead"
dvd,7 of 8,4.0,Offbeat Civil War era western,"""Major Dundee"" was noted director Sam Peckinpah""s first big budget feature film.  This new extended version with restored scenes previously cut unfortunately lengthens the film to make it drag on a bit too much.  The star studded cast features Charlton Heston playing Amos Dundee a disgraced Union cavalry officer who has been ignominiously assigned to serve as a prison commandant in a remote New Mexico fort.  Co-stars Richard Harris and James Coburn are complimented by an impressive array of western character actors featuring Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens and Dub Taylor."

As has been reported below the packaging is very poor because the DTS disc (the very one I want) is not secured correctly on the double disc spindle and has been bouncing around for the last 4000 miles! The disc surface is now scratched and damaged. I see no point in sending it back to Amazon for replacement because the chances are it'll happen again so I'll have to try and get it repaired which is a nuisance. This item would have got five stars were it not for this problem and it's a great shame
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,The last gem of Sidney Lumet,"This outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink, decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis.

I really became in tune with my core muscles and became more aware of my body.  I think it does a great job to tone up but not much for cardio.

The humor in these is fantastic and I can still remember watching them as a little boy in the early sixties. I plan to buy all future seasons and I really hope that all of Jay ward's cartoons come to DVD soon. I would really like to see George of the Jungle on DVD with super chicken and tom slick. I would buy those in a minute if available. I hope the people who decide what to release on DVD are listening.

I have been exercising for years and find that this is the only video that actually challenged me during pregnancy. She offers variations for all 3 trimesters and great prenatal exercise advice but doesn't waste tons of time in the video explaining easy maneuvers; she keeps the pace moving. There are 4 sections and to do all 4 it does take 50 minutes but the salsa dance (20 minutes) is absolutely fabulous.  Leisa Hart is energetic and makes me smile. It's the only one I would buy again

dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Nicolas Cage is ""Matchless""","Once again, Nicolas Cage demonstrates that he is not only one of the most versatile actors working today, but one of the best in Ridley Scott's ""Matchstick Men"".  Cage gives a master class in acting with his portrayal of Roy, a small-time L.A. con man with no life outside his 'work', and some Issues with a capital 'I'.  Roy suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which manifests itself in a fetish for cleanliness and various repetitive actions and physical twitches and tics.  Roy feels safest indoors, and when he's at home, gives free reign to all his idiosyncratic behaviors.  On the job, he's managed to master his condition well enough to build a very successful 'business', complete with his own junior partner (Sam Rockwell).  Roy's micro-managed life is thrown a curveball in the form of a 14-year-old girl named Angela (a dazzling turn by Alison Lohman of 'White Oleander', convincing as a young teen even though she was 22 at the time) . . .the daughter Roy has never met, since he split with her mom before Angela was born.  The burgeoning relationship between Roy and Angela forces Roy to confront the the moral dilemmas posed by his profession that are the true cause of his illness.  There's a lot of entertaining caper business along the way, but this father-daughter relationship is the heart of the film.  Cage embodies Roy with a decency and humanity that makes him likeable despite the bad things he does for a living.  In lesser hands, Roy's mannerisms might have overshadowed the character and pushed him into parody, but Cage applies them with restraint & consistency so that we get the feeling that inside and out, he IS Roy, as a man with this condition might actually exist.  When he pulls out all the stops to show Roy in the throes of a major meltdown, it's humorous, and yet shows the pathos of OCD in a way that wouldn't be possible if he were over the top all the time."

I watch this and see the beginning of some traditions and attitudes still in practice today.  &quot;With Compassion for Others, We Build - We Fight, for Peace with Freedom,&quot; from the Seabee Museum.

dvd,30 of 40,1.0,Great Artist Deserved a Better Film,"""Modigliani"" (2004) is a self-indulgent, pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist. Writer-director Mick Davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work. Ironically, the viewer has a better understanding of Pablo Picasso than Amedeo Modigliani. Despite his boundless enthusiasm, Andy Garcia is simply too old for the title role. An irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A few words about the title,"Plenty of reviews have described this amazing movie. I'd just like to add a note on the meaning of the title.  Most people have ignored it - one reviewer thought it was a reference to the frequency of shooting up. As an (ex) Brit, who grew up in Scotland, when I saw it, some time ago, I just automatically assumed something quite different."
dvd,4 of 34,1.0,boring,It's terribly boring. period.
dvd,1 of 5,2.0,Pathetic Gangster Style Movie,"I've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time.  I couldn't disagree more.  I found this film to be a disappointment.  Tom Hanks & period-gangster style films just don't go together.  When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.. not as a serious actor.  In ""Road To Perdition"" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangster in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing.  The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development.  I'm a big fan of movies like the Godfather & Goodfellas but this one just plain stinks"
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,As good as the first one if not better!!!!,"I have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie.  Most comments are so ridiculous, that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good.  Well I hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others.  THE MOVIE WAS FULL PACKED WITH ACTION.  THE 2 T-REX'S ATTACKING THE MAN IN THE CAR, IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GREAT SCENES, THE STEGOSAURUS ATTACK, WAS SO GOOD, THE RAPTORS SCENES KEPT ME ATTACHED TO MY SEAT, SCENES ON THE CLIFF WERE SO GOOD, DINOSOURS LOOSED ALL OVER THE ISLAND WAS VERY INTENSE.  T-REX ON THE SAN DIEGO, ONE OF THE FAVORITE SEQUENCES FOR MANY PEOPLE.  MY FAVORITE SEQUENCES WERE ON THE ISLAND THOUGH.  THE MOVIE IS INTENSE AND FULL OF ACTION.  EXCELLENT SEQUEL IF NOT BETTER.  MAYBE SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT NOTICED BUT ON THIS PAGE YOU CAN FIND THAT THE MOVIE WAS A TOTAL SUCCESS ON THE WHOLE WORLD WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, IT MADE $614 MILLIONS WORLD WIDE.  ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE MOVIE WAS NOMINATE FOR:"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,so funny,"This is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen.  Seriously, if you have a sense of humor, you will enjoy this movie to the fullest. Heck, I'd even watch this movie instead of some afternoon delight.  Maybe even with some afternoon delight.  It's that good."
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Grab Some Water and Get Breathless...,"This workout WORKS. It raises your heart rate, gets you moving, gets you breathless and is short enough to fit into ""shorter"" workout days - at 40 minutes including stretches. A perfect way to get your minimum 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,The tide has not eroded this cinematic masterpiece,"I hadn't given this movie much thought since seeing it when it came out originally in '91.  I remember finding it a fascinating film at the time which even prompted me to read the book and discover the writing quality of Conroy.  Unlike most such situations when I am disappointed by movie adaptations of great books, I found both genres to have their own beauty.  This past weekend I was loaned a copy of Prince of Tides and I spent a leisurely 2 hours enjoying this masterpiece for a second time.  Flashbacks are beautifully interspersed with real time discoveries.  Characters to love, hate, envy, pity and laugh with abound.  What impresses me most about this film is the impeccable way you find yourself switching from the lifestyle of the coastal south to the frenzy of New York City.  All cinematic elements combine to take you back and forth in time and location as the characters experience their pasts and make new memories for the future.  Nolte was brilliant.  Streisand was lovely as an actress and obviously gifted as director.  Blythe Danner was touching and talented as always, and the passage of time reveals the beauty both inner and outer she has bestowed on her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow.  Buy this film and plan an evening of enjoyment whether you are male or female, young or old.  The passage of time has done nothing to dim the quality of this film.  It is as impressive now as it was originally, maybe even more so since it has stood the test of time so well"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,BALLAD OF JACK & ROSE - JUST AN EXPERIMENT!!!,"I bought this film just because Daniel Day-Lewis was in it.  I had to think about it even so because of what might be objectionable content and I didn't want to get into such a film with Mr. Day-Lewis.  Thank goodness my interest in his performances overcame all this negativity and I went ahead.  There are many reviews here that explain the movie in indepth detail.  For me Daniel Day-Lewis makes this movie.  He portrays his character (Jack) so well that you mourn for him and ache for the young daughter (Rose)who is going to live a large portion of her lifetime without this father who is absolutely everything to her but is very ill and will die soon.  Still this pull toward each other in an unhealthy way is relatively new and they are trying to maintain the loving relationship they have without really confronting this problem. He definitely has the girlfriend, Kathleen, (who has two teenage sons that he had never met) move in with him and his daughter (big mistake) to help keep the relationship one of father/daughter but he tries to tell his daughter this  is ""just an experiment"" to possibly get the help they need since he is so ill.  Actually, he was in a panic over his feelings about his daughter when he made this decision, had never mentioned this girlfriend to his daughter, and there doesn't seem to be a connection other than physical with this woman, therefore it was destined to fail. The contrast of homelife before vs. after these people move in is absolutely terrible to say the least.  If I had to start each day with these people after what had been my normal everyday life, I would have probably become self-destructive too.  This ""intrusion"" into their lives is the beginning of the end.  Rose is extremely hurt and angry and feels ""tricked"" into having to live with these people.  This parent and child have been alone on this island many years, and feelings have become confused. She has begun to be seductive in her behavior and she wants to actively pursue this type of relationship with her father but he is overwhelmed with how to handle this situation   and is overcome with guilt about the feelings he has for her. This film handles this departure from the norm in such a caring way that you become completely engrossed with their problems overall and understand how difficult this is for the father to confront and resolve.  No one could have made me believe I would love this film as I do.  Please don't be put off by what may seem to be a movie regarding unacceptable behavior because you will miss some of the best performances ever given, in my opinion, as well as a film you won't ever forget.  I do hope that Daniel Day-Lewis will continue to make films.  He is excellent at his craft.  Do yourself a favor and try this.  Just be aware that due to the problems addressed in this film, a lot of pain and anguish are involved and the end of this film is beautiful but absolutely heartbreaking"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,I want more!,"Season 2 is just great. Beautiful color. Really quality dvds. Great shows. Especially the Thanksgiving and Christmas shows. All I can say is ""when is season 3 coming out?"""
dvd,9 of 11,5.0,Good if you don't mind minor edits,"Finally got around to watching this last night. In this review I'm not going to bother to review the movie itself. It's seventeen years old. I'm sure if you are interested in it you've seen it by now. Rather, I'm going to review the technical quality of the film and the extras provided on the DVD. One thing that feel I should point out up front is that the movie HAS been edited, but only in one scene. The infamous 'clergyman sporting an erection' that caused such a stupid flundie flap has been photoshopped. The theatrical poster artwork is not on the cover or anywhere on the disc for a similar reason. You can find out more by going to Snopes and looking in the Disney films section. I personally don't care, but some people do. Now, on to the review."

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Warm and glowing-a must-see,"This is the kind of movie that leaves a smile on your face and a glow around you for the rest of the day. Marty, a young pioneer woman, is widowed on the trail soon after she and her husband set out to find themselves a new home. Left poor, alone, and despertely grieving, she accepts the proposal of a near-stranger that she marry him and care for his motherless daughter in return for a roof over her head and passage back to the East when the wagon trains came again. At first, confronted with a rebellious and bitterly resentful girl and crippled by her own terrible grief, Marty can barely funtion. But gradually she settles into this newlife, and just as gradually she, the little girl Missy, and the widower Clark Davis grow to accept each other. This is a worthy adaptation of Janette Oak's bestselling Christian fiction books, and is guaranteed to be loved by any period movie lover. The religious themes add depth to the story but are handled with enough delicacy and restraint that they don't overwhelm or smother it. The love story is really beautiful in itself, and Dale Midkiff, the widower, projects such warmth and feeling into his scenes, particularly the amazing last scene, that it lights up the whole movie. He's an amazing talent. Good performances all around, a well-developed plot, and the story's warmth and purity make this a movie to remember. A must for any lover of romance"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,A Concert Spectacle That Rocks!!!,A lot of fun to watch  One of those concerts that you enjoy enormously watching on a nice system but likely wouldnt enjoy as much if you were there since you wouldnt be able to see what was going on as much.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic!,"The 24th Day is a terrific ride. James Marsden and Scott Speedman give engaging and unsettling performances, even keeping secrets from the viewers until the last frame and beyond. This film is one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen in years"
dvd,7 of 8,4.0,Excellent Production of a classic.,"     This DVD has all the elements that would ear-mark it as a favorite for me.  Based on a classic novel, beautifully produced period piece, I'm a fan of the lovely Keeley Hawes who plays the lead.  "
dvd,,5.0,2nd Best Pixar movie,"Cars is an excellent Pixar movie. It's a car version of Thomas The Tank Engine with storyline references to Doc Hollywood, but it's easily the 2nd best Pixar movie topping Finding Nemo. The DVD has great special features such as an epilogue and the Inspiration of Cars. I enjoy the animated short films One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight. The folks at Pixar have done it again brining in a great story, great characters, plenty of eye-popping computer animated effects. I especially am into vehicles"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,MEDIUM - THE SERIES - FIRST SEASON,I bought Seasons 1 and 2 and can't wait for 3!  I LOVE this show - I'm usually very tired when the show comes on and miss many episodes - this way I can watch it over and over - Patricia Arquette is Terrific and so is the entire cast. I recommend this highly - by the way for those who don't know there is a real Allison Dubois - that is why it is that much more interesting to watch.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"A film which is spectacle at its best , although spectacle is by no means all of it...","From 1939 to 1948, two major Westerns done with taste and skill and with an eye to beauty could be mentioned: John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" and Howard Hawks' ""Red River."" "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Very compelling film.,"When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think.  Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for ""enjoyment.""  That being said, I love this movie, and here's why.  "
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Well it's about time,"This is one of those good action flicks in a long list that have taken way too long to make the DVD transfer.  This is quite possibly an action fan's best introduction to Thomas Ian Griffith.  Once you become acquainted with this film, you will soon realize just how underutilized this man is in the Hollywood Action scene.  He combines impressive moves with decent acting chops and just comes across as a pretty cool cat.  In addition, this was a fresh action film.  It didn't rely on lead spraying alone.  Character developement and a few twists combined with awesome casting--James Earl Jones, among other familiar and welcome faces--was obviously important in the overall spectrum of this movie.  It wasn't just thrown together.  We get a cop who winds up caught in the crossfire of the shadey politics of his own police precinct, finding himself alone in the struggle with no one to trust after his partner is brutily murdered.  This film poses the question, ""how well do you know your friends?""  This is one you can share with fellow action fans that may not have had the pleasure of viewing.  Griffith's movies are few and far apart but they're all worth watching.  Support this man!  I'm looking forward to seeing his work on the sequel to Timecop"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,A Favorite Movie!!!,"Practical Magic is a comedic love story that is fun and entertaining no matter how many times you have seen it. Yes, it is different than the book, but Hollywood is Hollywood.  The movie would not be as much fun if not for the changes-for example Midnight margaritas is a fun scene that makes you smile and wish you were part of the comradery. The Aunts are more lovable and less old & serious than in the book. It is not nec. to go into all the details of the movie if you have not seen it why spoil it for you and besides odds are you have seen it and are thinking about adding it to your collection- so go for it.  The bonus features on the DVD are entertaining and interesting.  I would tell anyone who likes fun movies to add this one to their collection and don't forget to plant rosemary by your garden gate. Enjoy it"

dvd,9 of 9,5.0,I was AMAZED that I could achieve immediate RESULTS!,"I have worked out with numerous VHS/DVDs, and at times I was bored or just quit and ended up sitting on the couch watching the instructor workout.  David changes the routines with perfect timing to keep you interested and motivated.  This was key in my ability to continue with the routines.... I hate boring, tedious workouts.  In addition, David would remind me to keep focused (put your ""brain"" into it) on the body part being worked on so that the workout wasn't aimless and/or futile."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Amazing!!!,I finally got this DVD and watched it to bring in the New Year.  I had read many of the Amazon reviews and was expecting it to be sub-par in quality.  So I was surprised at how incredible this DVD was.
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,No day but today!,"I absolutely love this film. It is one of the best ever. I have been dying to see it on Broadway, but haven't been able to. It's so hard to anyways with Broadway being so expensive. But the film is amazing."
dvd,0 of 2,1.0,Poor Release of Movie,I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,A master piece,"This is a very well done documentary, nice maps, good comparisons between then and now battle fields. Interesting, I saw the French version and whenever the narrator said British the French said ""allied"", to undermine the English participation in the war. A must have item for those History lovers"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Multicultural Misunderstanding,"The movie begins in a welter of confusion, but I guess all versions of PRIDE and PREJUDICE share the problem of having to sort out five (in this case four) daughters of an avaricious and greedy mother, plus the best friend of one of them, so you have all these girls ""of a marriageable age"" and it takes a little while to realize who is who.  As many have noted, however, BRIDE AND PREJUDICE has the incomparable advantage of luscious Aishwarya Rai, so you know right away that she is the heroine."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A powerful and moving story.,"I initially wanted to see this movie because I am a huge Oliver Martinez fan and I wanted to see more of his work.  The fact that Oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me.  I was so engrossed from beginning to end with this movie that I hardly noticed Oliver was missing.  Javier Bardem has to be one of the most passionate actors I have ever seen.  I was mesmerized by his protrayal of Reinaldo Arenas.  And while this movie may not be for everyone, I would say it is the best biographical movie I have seen in my lifetime.  As added bonuses, there was Oliver Martinez, for me, of course.  Also, Sean Penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen.  Johnny Depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer.  His facial expressions alone are pure comical genius.  And, while I am a huge Johnny Depp fan,as well, I am glad his parts were minimal as Javier Bardem is the true acting genius in this film.  I am now going to further investigate Reinaldo Arenas and Javier Bardem and see what else they have done that may interest me.  Isn't that the true motivation of a movie or writer....making you want more from them? "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Just finished a marathon session,"Watched all of Season 4 this weekend.   This is my favorite one yet - if you enjoyed the other three seasons you will definitely enjoy this one.

dvd,24 of 26,5.0,A simple story,"Akira Kurosawa made Rashomon in 1950, Ikiru in 1952 and The Seven Samurai in 1954. All these films have quite a complex structure. Yet Ikiru remains a very simple film, which says nothing original:  it's not what is shown, but how, that is important, as in Flaubert's story  ""A Simple Heart"". It will be appreciated best by those who've realised they're going to die (you'll know what I mean). Watching Ozu's Tokyo Story beforehand will prepare you for the subtle style. In Ikiru five themes are interwoven: "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"""Rich People are the Theorists.""","Yes, they are and they refuse to stop trying to ""help"" the rest of us with their persistent self-righteousness. They always want to lift up the common man and their way of doing it is to sink the population deeply in the muck. Here, unlike with many a Hollywood offering and countless election, it is spoof we are given and thank God for that. That's the best way in which poverty manipulating silver spooned populists should be viewed. Sullivan has it all and decides to become a bum with 10 cents in his pocket-much to the chagrin of the studio heads he made rich. The only thing is that on the way to the gutter he meets a pretty fabulous girl. The plot then turns...well you'll find out."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Practically perfect!,"It's been a while since I've been really delighted with a belly dance DVD. This DVD is something special, though! I've been listening to a great Arabic radio station (thank heaven for TiVo!) and was looking for something that would explain Arabic rhythms. The information Raquy presents is enough to justify the cost of this DVD alone!"
dvd,,5.0,Love These Workouts!!,"This DVD is Great! I watched the first 2 seasons of the show so I could relate to the people in the video, because I saw how much weight they have lost, and how their lives have changed by getting fit. Those who have never seen the show can still relate to the participants because you can see that they are working hard and struggling also. I have lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks by eating healthy and doing this video daily. I mix n match work-outs each day."
dvd,,5.0,THE ROAD HOME,This dvd is excellent.  The subtitles take nothing from the beautiful cinematogrophy.  The subtle nuances leave the viewers imagination the pleasure of wondering what this beautiful woman is thinking and feeling as she yearns for her true love.  Zhang is brilliant and genuine.  This was a joy to watch and a fond memory to hold.  A pleasure.  
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent,"This is a great workout.  It's only 35 minutes long but I can always feel it in my [...]and thighs the next day.  I am definitely not a 'jump-up-and-down-and-say-yeah' aerobics person but this is a great exception.  Ellen Barrett cues very well and she's enthusiastic (using the word 'beautiful!' quite liberally) but she's not annoying.  The setting is gorgeous and the music doesn't dominate over Barret's cues.  Also, the girl with dark hair is so consistently high-energy that it's motivating- I don't think I've ever seen anyone smile so much."
dvd,6 of 17,2.0,Crap floats in the toilet.... and in space,I went to the screening of this movie at Paramount back in '97 and I remembered having a better reaction to this movie than the dissappointment I am now experiencing as I have just finished watching it on video.

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Amazing combat sequences,"Given that no special effects were used and that the film took two years to complete.... the aerial combat sequences are fantastic.  The plot-lines are trivial, but universal.  I think that the horrors of a seemingly endless war in Europe are well presented.  This quite an enjoyable film, particularly if you are conversant with Howard Hughs dedication to get it made"

dvd,28 of 35,5.0,1925 Version On DVD At Last.,There is a growing and welcome trend in recent months among DVD releases of classic films. If the title is a remake of a silent film version then the original is now being included along with the remake. Of course it's the remake that gets all the headlines but that is as it should be since most people aren't silent film enthusiasts. I was originally opposed to this idea on economic grounds as multidisc sets are expensive but then it occured to me that without the remake we wouldn't get to see the original at all and this way people can be exposed to the silent versions and hopefully learn to judge them on their own merits. Already we have the 1921 CAMILLE coupled with the 1936 Garbo version and the 1925 WIZARD OF OZ (plus other silent Oz films) newly restored with the classic 1939 version. Now comes the celebrated 1925 version of BEN-HUR accompanying the even more celebrated 1959 William Wyler/Charlton Heston film on a 4 disc set and later this month the 1923 version Of Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS will be issued along with a restored version of the 1956 film for its 50th anniversary. But back to BEN-HUR. As a silent film enthusiast I will comment on the 1925 film as very little has been said about it compared to all that has been said about the much better known 1959 movie.
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Ready for Red Planet,"This is a good solid sci-fi movie.  Great special effects are a staple, but I liked the interplay between characters.  It is true that the movie has a dark overtone, but it is about overcoming that adversity.  Casting was good.  It is not the greatest Mars movie of all time, but it is well worth seeing."

dvd,1 of 10,4.0,Comments to the product,"The Frei reportage is highly intensive, comparison between action and the Nachtwey photos is interesting. For 20 dollars plus mail expense I missed, however, a still photogallery"
dvd,,5.0,Avant-Garde and Stylistic,"This French film was the directorial debut for a then 26-year-old Luc Besson. Christopher Lambert and Isabelle Adjani are a surprise great match. It's both a romantic comedy and social satire over a group of vagabonds who live underground in the Paris metro system. There is more than one story with Adjani and Lambert tying in the characters. It is not clear what the ""papers"" are that Lambert has stolen from Adjani, which hints that its a ploy on both ends to spend time together."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,a view into history,"This film harks back to a time when we had truly great men leading this country.  All the actors played their parts well and did an excellent job of portraying the people and culture of the time.  The weapons, equipment and uniforms were all technically correct for the period.  Overall, the film shows how things were at one time when most of our country's citizens could unite behind a cause, instead of the division, strife and controversy that characterizes such things today. Very refreshing"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Broken Minds,"Dario Argento's first overtly supernatural horror film is an aesthetic triumph, an overpowering tableaux of colour, a visual overload that is quite unforgettable. Employing the by then outmoded Technicolor system gives the film a strange surreal lustre, a nightmarish never land in which strong primary colours weave and clash in perfect symmetry to create a fairy tale world in which the agents of myth, legend and folklore play out their cruel and violent games. Situating his film within mythical stories of witchcraft, gives the film a distinct European flavour but in a different way to say ""Profondo Rosso"" or ""Bird with the Crystal Plumage"", these films offered a chic, cosmopolitan and somewhat decadent vision of Europe. As a result the nightmare logic of the film (aided and abetted by a frankly astonishing soundtrack) is given an added resonance and reality. Critics of the film might attack it's derivative and nonsensical narrative, lack of emotion or dubious acting, but this is too miss the point entirely. ""Suspiria"" is an art-horror film, I don't mean this in a pretentious way in relation to notions of art cinema, but art as in a picture in a gallery. It's entire purpose is to overwhelm the viewer with aesthetic brilliance and in this regard it is a masterpiece of the genre. "
dvd,,5.0,A Wonderful Surprise!,"I was interested in this film because I'm a Bruce Campbell fan, but I did not expect him to play a prominent role.  Bruce is not in too many scenes, but his appearances (mainly towards the end of the film) are great!  Not a typical role for him at all."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Harry Potter 4,For The movie:
dvd,0 of 3,4.0,A rare genre piece,"Simply put, The Other is truly a slow moving story, but has a certain creepiness that tends to open the doorway to the imagination. Don't waste your time on the film until  you have read the book. There is a certain uncomfortable feeling you get while reading The Other, a stirring haunting feeling that starts at the base of your spine then travels upward while all the while building supense. I would have to recommend this book to those who have not experienced it's touch."
dvd,,4.0,"Fun, full-body workout for lazy girls like me!","For so long, I have avoided working out because of some really negative feelings I've attached to the process. I still have vivid pictures in my mind of getting dressed in dowdy gym clothes, fighting traffic, and waiting to use machines that I wasn't really sure how to use in the first place! There were times when I had to take two hours out of my day just to exercise for less than half of that time. I think my gym experience might have been better had I hired a personal trainer, but let's face it--not all of us have the money to do this, especially broke students like me. I had a little more luck with a treadmill and some Tae-Bo, but found that the intense cardio didn't particularly agree with my joints or my downstairs neighbors. ;)"
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Disappointing in more ways than as a remake,"It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so"
dvd,2 of 3,1.0,Not the best of John Carpenter,"This film is really sad. Sad because if you look at it closely you can find a lot of good ideas ultimately ruined by poor delivery. And knowing this is written and directed by John Carpenter, I have to wonder why it isn't any better."

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,An efficient and effective workout!,"This is a great workout for someone who has already had some exposure to pilates.  Someone who is completely new to pilates may have to watch and then practice the instructional part of the DVD (40 minutes) before they are ready to try the actual workout section (20 minutes).  But I still think someone who is new to pilates, but in fairly good physical condition could use this DVD.  She does explain and demonstrate variations during the instructional part of the DVD, but doesn't use them during the actual workout, so you just have to remember them, if you need them."

dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Nothing compared to Halloween but still good,I have never been a big Friday the 13th fan but I decided to pick this up when it was on sale at best buy. It is not the greatest box set there should have been more features. The few commentaries that they had were not that great either. But the special features that they do have on the bonus disc were great. And you buy it for the movies anyway.
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,I'm a sucker for Lollilove,"The best mockumentaries are the ones so deadpan, so serious, that you almost feel uncomfortable while watching it because the situations seem so believable and awkward.

dvd,,2.0,"not very good at all, i don't recommend","i got this because i have recently started a weight loss program and wanted to expand on my fitness DVD library. i love dance, and i wanted to try new things, and i thought that it was good value. EEEEEHT!! was i wrong. this woman is in one word: pesky. i watched all her performances, and her dances were overly bouncy, stiff, and beginner. i got the impression she was like a child performing some made up dance for her family, and we were supposed to nod and smile indulgently and say shes great. she always has this big cheesy smile on her face, and not only does she wear too much makeup but the clothes she wears hide her legs and you cant get a good idea of the footwork which is a real hinderance. the bellydancing is a disgrace, and ive seen enough belly dancing instruction videos to know. i was like 'what is she doing...' then i saw that she was doing the step kick step kick hip drop with her arms ""framing"" her body. i was like 'oh NO no no no no, that is NOT the way to do that'. her hand movements for her basic egyptian, which is simply touching your temple with one arm and sticking the other one out and alternating, was barely recognizable. she can't do undulations and in her performance she does like one, then walks arounds some more, its like the whole time she walks around just doing a kick here, a kick there, swirls her ugly veil around like a 5 year old, and does bad impressions of otherwise beautiful moves, almost like there was no effort, no ""push"". not to mention her costume was HORRIBLE. one of the worst ones, but i think the 100 pom pom samba outfit takes the cake in the worst cosstume EVER award.

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,The negative reviews here ARE helpful and accurate,"Yes, this is one of my favorite films. But people here seem to be voting the negative reviews as not being ""helpful"" only because they are offended that some one insulted their precious movie. Lame. Fans of the 80's Manchester music scene will enjoy this movie, but it could have been done so much better. That music era deserves a much better documentary than this poorly structured film. I really do like this movie, but the negative reviews here that I read ARE pretty accurate, and can be helpful. I do appreciate the reviewers who are at least being honest. "

dvd,,4.0,What scary used to be...,I saw this movie a few years back and loved it.  It truly had me spooked throughout the whole film.  I played it for a few friends and family one winter night (aged 15 through 70) and everyone was jumping and screaming from start to finish.  It was great fun for everyone and they still bring it up to this day.  I lent my copy out and (unfortunately) never got it back.  Now I am buying it for the second time (I recently purchased a projector and this one will be played outside on the wall of my house).  I seriously recommend this one

dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Joy with a quibble,"The appearance of this set is an occasion to celebrate, as all the reviews make clear.  But dare I introduce a small note of disappointment?  I would gladly have sacrificed the Barkleys of Broadway here for The Gay Divorcee (1934) whose cast,  mood, etc. make it a much better companion for Top Hat et al. P.S. I see now that the Gay Divorcee was being saved for Part Two of the DVD box sets--an attempt, no doubt, to get Astaire-Rogers fans to buy all 10 films! It will succeed with me eventually, no doubt.  Pardon me for being an igneous intrusion! "
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,A remarkable collection.,"I am 24 years old so one would not expect me to be a huge fan of these ""older"" films.  On the contrary I am not just a fan I love them.  One of my bosses turned me on to them a few years ago and I was always a huge Peter Sellers fan (mostly for his Pink Panther series) but after picking up this collection I found it to be a wonderful addition to my film library.  Yesterday during the blizzard I watched four of the five disks.  I found Kind Hearts and Coronets to be not only an interesting story but also darkly satiical.  Many scenes were so well crafted I could not help to laugh.  Alec was remarkable in this film as he played 8 different characters.  Quite a feat for that time and a role Mike Meyers would love.  Ladykillers was the only film I had seen previous to buying this set and I must say that not only is it an outstanding caper film but the DVD transfer was superb.  The image quality really has brightened up fromt he onld VHS I saw.  This film also shows some of Sir Alec's truly great acting and was brutally histerical.  Peter Sellers yelling at a parrot was funny to see considering he went on to many more scenes involving fowl later on in life.  The Lavender Hill Mob was probably the most intriguing of the 4 I have seen.  Another crime caper flick Sir Alec really starred and the story was very solid.  Also there was a car chase scene in this film that was extremely well done considering the time.  The last film I managed to watch was the Man in the White Suit.  While this film shows Alec again at his best I found it to be a little weaker than the other three.  It was funny at times and an interesting enough plot just not as good if watched in succesion with the others.  The final film is the Captain's Paradise but I have yet to view that one and will not review it.  All the films look great on DVD and if you are young (like me)and have never seen any of these films you are really missing out on some of the masterpieces of the film industry.  The only collection I could possibly recomend more to anyone is the Peter Sellers set.  Better yet, buy them both like I did"

dvd,20 of 22,5.0,Fantastic Skill,"I completely agree with Cesar Millan, my dogs are pretty well behaved, but trying some of his techniques really made a different immediately.  I completely recommend this product to anyone.  And completely disagree with the first review, wherein you have to reward your dog for everything, they should listen to you because you love them and want the best for them not because you will reward them with something.  You should reward them for tricks, not for well-being and obedience"

dvd,9 of 15,4.0,Unfamiliar with Degrassi,"I'll be the first to admit, I saw ""Jay and Silent Bob"" and bought the disc, however I didn't really know much about Degrassi the next generation. But it's OK, because the disc is pretty self explanitory when it comes to stories from other episodes that were carried over. One thing You'll have to keep in mind is that this was just a guest spot by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith on 3 episodes, the episodes were about Kevin Smith wanting to shoot his new Jay and Silent bob movie there(in Canada). One thing i didn't like was how Kevin kept throwing in anti Bush jabs into the show. I'm not a Bush supporter, but Bush bashing really had no place in this show."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Hilarious story in my hometown!,"My whole family loves ""A Christmas Story.""  My sister and I were born and raised in Hammond, Indiana (Shepherd's hometown which he calls ""Hohman"" in the story), and though it wasn't filmed there, Shepherd captures the essence of the scruffy old steel town.  But more than that, it's a great piece of nostalgia.  My dad loves it because it reminds him of his own childhood in the 1930's--grumpy father, sooty furnace and all.  Everyone will love it because it is a funny take on the American Christmas hullaballoo.  Yet under the cynical veneer, there is real magic, and therein lies the genius of Jean Shepherd"

dvd,2 of 5,5.0,wow...,I saw this movie in my english class at a community college and I was amazed with Michelle Rodriguez's performance.  She is a really great actress. She played her character as a woman boxer really well.  She showed great potiental in this movie.  This movie made me a big fan of hers now
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent dramatization of the Wannsee Conference,"The cast says it all: Kenneth Branagh as Heydrich, Stanley Tucci as Eichmann, Colin Firth as the co-author of the Nuremberg laws, and virtually every other English-speaking actor of note working today. Based on the transcript of the actual Wannsee Conference, filmed at the house in Berlin's Wannsee district where the real conference occurred, the matter-of-fact way in which these high government and military officials decide how and where to kill all of Europe's Jews is blood curdling. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Branagh and Tucci worthy recipients of Emmys. The film, also and Emmy winner for best drama, educates and enlightens, and even entertains as it explores the psyches of these ordinary men who sat down and decided to kill 6 million people because they could"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Another Great Season,"Tales from the Crypt season three doesn't disappoint, except the package does. All of the episodes are very entertaining and brilliantly written. There are no dead coming back to life stories this season, but the stories prove you don't need it to be creepy. What really shines on this DVD collection are the extras. "

dvd,,5.0,Good Pokemon Fun,"I bought this for my 9 year old son.  He is big Pokemon fan.  The Box sets are the most economical way to buy Pokemon shows.

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Anime with a conclusion..,"Perhaps it is just me, but recent anime series i've watched have had pretty craptacular endings. Either the last episode is full of characters looking forlornly at a sunset, bunny, stapler, etc. or you get assaulted by random clips from the entire series freeze-framed and displayed so quickly your brain starts to seize up."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,The transposition and breakthrough of the reality may become an awful nightmare!,"What would it happen if you break the neck to logic, conventional social principles set out of context and play with the sense of the words meaning?

dvd,34 of 34,4.0,A SOLID COLLECTION!,"I've been a bit tough on some of these recent Disney collections due to the fact that all or most of the shorts were already appearing on the Disney Treasures sets and so getting those were a much better value.  But in this case, only three of these are on those Treasures sets and each is on a different one so it makes this a definite one to pick up.  Certaintly they will eventually be on the Treasures editions but until then I would recommend this set.  Be advised that even though it says holiday celebration not all of these shorts really have a holiday theme.  Some are simply shorts that take place in the winter."

dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Don't mis-judge Mike Judge,"I know a lot of you who have never seen Beavis and Butthead probably think very little of the show based on the low-brow nature of it (I was one of them), but if you give this movie a chance you'll see that it's actually as well written and at times as, dare I say, subtle as King of the Hill."
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,The Director's Cut: A Totally Different Film,"Is this even the same film? It's criminal what was done in the theatrical cut. Add back in almost an hour of material and it goes from a choppy, fitfully introspective swords & sandals movie to a cohesive, deeply introspective, more historically accurate masterpiece. Well, almost a masterpiece. Give it about an A-."
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,Transformative Video,"I can't say enough good about this video.  It is just wonderful - very transformative. I usually do the full video several times a week and get something from it every time. With this video, Ana Brett and Ravi Singh have created a wonderful gift for anyone interested in better physical, emotional, and mental health"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Get the feeling you've ever been cheated?,"The good thing about this is that it's an excellent time capsule of a music form that has sadly become a joke. The best is saved for last with the Ramones. What should have been the best performance has been slightly marred with the partial censorship of Wendy O. Williams spray painting ""Fornicate me, Status Quo"" on the soon-to-be sacrificial Chevy Nova while the Plasmatics blaze through ""Masterplan"". Spliced in is Richie Stotts' foray into the audience from the previous song ""Head Banger"". Wendy O would throw up in her grave, as the Plasmatics hepled pave punk and this is an insult. Also, there are two numbers (The Jam's Funeral Pyre and Iggy's TV Eye) that are brief due to being played at each show's end. Otherwise, it's an excellent time capsule for punk"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"With my luck, my kid is going to end up like this...","It's Alive is a Classic B movie from the 70's. What's it about?  Two words: Killer Baby.  Despite you ever getting a chance to see the baby, it's a rather interesting film that is done pretty well.  Take this movie for what it is.  It's a B movie with good acting, hilarious storyline, yet manages to take itself seriously.  I was surprised by this film.  I thought it would have been pure crap, but it was carried out rather well and seriously.  I really enjoyed the movie as I am sure others do too.  I wouldn't advise buying this movie though, just rent it instead or get it for a cheap price.  It's not a film you will watch often, but you will find yourself telling your friends about it.  Rent it, laugh a bit, and enjoy it.  I sure did.  My favorite scene was when the killer baby attacks the milkman, it's awesome. "

dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Quite Funny,"I highly enjoyed this movie.  Okay, more than that.  When I first saw it at the age of eleven, it taught me everything I know about Watergate in a funny and memorable fashion.  This is the story of how two self-proclaimed ""stupid teenagers"" named Betsy and Arlene brought down the corrupt Nixon administration.  Arlene lives in the Watergate complex and she and her best friend Betsy are there the night of the break-in.  On a class trip to the White House, they get lost in the West Wing, pick up the CREEP list thinking it's toilet paper and eventually become Nixon's dog-walkers and secret youth advisors.  When they accidentally stumble across one of his tapes, however, they begin to uncover the truth.  They give the story to rival reporters Woodward and Bernstein under the alias Deepthroat (the name of a porn movie Betsy's drug-addicted older brother saw).  The movie is filled with funny and clever historical inside jokes (my personal favorite is having government agents follow Betsy and Arlene in a van labled ""The Plumbers""). Dick will teach anyone a lot about Watergate along with having hilarious actors and an amazing soundtrack"
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,True Noir Style.....,I guess this release will be the 25th anniversary addition.  I can't believe it's been that long.  It's a film that sticks with you for a looong time after viewing it.  
dvd,,5.0,A Movie About World War One That is Truly Outstanding,"The Lost Battalion is one of the few movies made about the ""Great War"" that really is well done. It gives the viewer a sense of the uncertainty, the fear, the carnage, and the death that was a part of fighting in WW1. It is a moving tribute to an American battalion which fought in that war and went above and beyond the call of duty. It should be viewed by everyone who admires the courage and sacrifice of the American soldier"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,An Indelible Masterpiece,"There are not enough superlatives to describe what a great film this is.  Having only seen Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's ""The Red Shoes"" recently I purchased this on a whim.  Never having previously heard of this film I was immensely rewarded viewing it.  The film was ostensibly a morale booster for war torn Britain but it works on so many levels.  The complexity of it's themes make it timeless.  This film celebrates the landscape of Britain, the vast array of people who toil in it to make it great, their perserverence, and not least of all, their spirit.  The film follows three ""pilgrims"" to Canterbury who have suffered recent personal setbacks who make the journey for some kind of enlightenment:  A land girl(Sheila Sim) whose RAF fiancee is missing in action, an American G.I.(John Sweet) who is lovesick from not hearing from his sweetheart, and a British organist(Dennis Price) who toils in a London cinema even though he is academy trained.  Their journey brings them something of an epiphany in ways that are unimaginable.  The cast is uniformly superb but I think special mention should be made for John Sweet, a real life American serviceman enlisted by Powell for this film.  Sweet may have been an amateur but it's the very realness of his performance that draws you to his character.  It makes you wonder that if this film were more of a success that Sweet could have had a career on the big screen than in the classrooms as a teacher in Ohio.  As if that were not enough the package contains supplementary material that enhances your enjoyment of this film.  Aside from enlightening interviews with Sweet and Sim, the film also contains footage filmed for an American audience with Kim Hunter that did not appear in the British cut.  This footage detracts from the director's cut and goes to show how the studio honchoes underestimate the audience's intelligence.  Also of interest is a documentary about a Michael Powell film society's pilgrimage through locations featured in the film on the centennial of the director's birth and a vintage documentary highlighting the sights and sounds of Britain at the height of World War II.

I was in my native Georgia, in high school, and spent a weekend in bed with the book.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down.  Margaret Mitchell's characters were sparkling with vitality and a contagious energy that made you feel as though they were your own neighbors and family!"
dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Bah humbug,"This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Horrific And Awesome Action Movie With Heart And Rage,"  Years before moviemakers really starting getting comic book adaptations right with films like ""Spider-Man"" and ""Batman Begins"" came ""Darkman"", a brilliant action-horror movie that came closer than any show before it to capturing the darker, more developed comics of the modern era.  It's a gory and action-packed - and intelligent, emotional and quite often humorous - tale as Peyton Westlake (superbly played by Liam Neeson) becomes the Darkman after barely surviving an attack by mob thugs employed by the crimelord Durant (Larry Drake), who Westlake's attorney girlfriend Julie (Frances McDormand) is trying to bring down.  A scientist researching the development of a perfect synthetic skin to aid burn victims, it's being immersed in this liquid in its unstable corrosive state and then left for dead following the explosive destruction of his lab that is largely responsible for Westlake's metamorphis into Darkman."

dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Great Book,"The Sum of All Fears is about soldiers in war. The book talks about the fear men have when they are in war. We never think about the fear men have when they're in a war. In The Sum of All fears soldiers were surrounded by friends and men dying around them. They worry about staying alive each second. They crawl from one ditch to another. Soldiers are always thinking about their families at home. The Sum of All Fears describes fears of men in all different countries in the Middle East like Israeli, Sea of Galilee. The first part is telling the time and places. Also what the men were doing. The soldiers were involved in Israeli held-Golan Height on Saturday the 6th of October 1973. These are soldiers recounting events."
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,We Want MORE Spider-Man!!!,"A lot of people like me who watches superhero movies want to watch a whole bunch of action with soo much CGI you cant even tell what's real or not. Anyways, I expected this movie to have the too much action I can handle. Guess I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but I just hope Spidey 3 will have tons of action!!!!!!!! And Tons of CGI EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!With 3 NEW VILLAINS!!!!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!! SANDMAN, HOBGOBLIN, and VENOM!!!!!!!!! Anwyays, just don't make the movie about Peter Parker, but Spider-Man, THANK YOU Stan Lee for creating Spider-man"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,A Classic, I watched this movie and can honestly saay that it was worth my time. For the time period the casting and acting was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is definitely worth buying to extend your classics collection

dvd,11 of 11,5.0,It's Yoga-Infused Pilates (It's supposed to be relaxing),"If you've ever taken yoga or pilates, or have any idea at all what these things might entail, you know that one could comfortably refer to these as the subtle excercise arts.  It simply is not cardio.  It isn't step.  This is a toning workout, as pilates and yoga often are.   "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,a classic,I've watched this movie for the seventh time recently and still can't get enough. I bought the DVD knowing that I'll want to watch it again and again. Highly recommended
dvd,,4.0,"Meanders a bit, but is still entertaining","Those who have enjoyed the ""Prairie Home Companion"" over the years, will probably enjoy this movie.  It is a typical Garrison Keillor production with the addition of a thin plot and lots of celebrities.  The show has supposedly been bought out by a company in Texas which plans to tear down the building and replace it with a parking lot.  The cast, including Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as singing sisters, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as a couple of randy, singing cowboys, performs a bittersweet and nostalgic last show.  The celebrity singers do very well with the singing and the acting, and the movie becomes very similar to a typical ""Prairie Home Companion"" broadcast.  The beginning of the show is somewhat disjointed, but once the performances start, the movie picks up speed and is full of gentle humor and toe-tapping songs.  An angel in a white trench coat drifts through the movie, looking for someone to ""take to God"" and Lindsay Lohan adds a dark note as Streep's poetry-spouting, suicide-obsessed daughter.  Some of it works and some of it doesn't, but the gentle humor and old-fashioned music remain"

I had forgotten, or at least gotten a little lax in adherence to these principals.  Cesar's tips in this video are easy and basic elements to successful training.  Identify yourself as the pack leader, then training proceeds much more smoothly.  We the people need to treat the dogs as dogs, not as people.  With that, there is still plenty of time for love, hugs and kisses, after the work is done.  This is an excellent resource for dog owners of any caliber"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Still funny afetr all these years,I watched this recently on vacation and forgot how funny the movie was.  Pee Wee is a classic.  My kids (8 and 5) and I sit and laugh out loud.  A fantastic DVD- well worth the money
dvd,,5.0,Staggering,"Wonderful, witty, beguiling; touching and true. Utterly brilliant script, direction, acting. Pure light entertainment, humour and sadness.

Kathy is an expert and I love this video, and trust me, I'm no fitness guru, just a regular housewife who wanted to add weight lifting to her walking routine in order to firm my upper arms, and all I can say is, Wow! This video works!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Just what I needed,"With so much information out there on newborn care it can be very overwhelming. This dvd gives a visual to calm the anxiety. I don't think it claims to know everything, it just gives the ""abc's"" of newborn care. If it had as much information as a book it would probably be 3 hours long. This dvd is 45 minutes which was all I could sit through."
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,A Vigilante Society,"Sometimes I wonder how it is we don't live in a vigilante society.  People do such awful things and alot of times the system really can't/don't do anything for the victims.  Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt with.  "
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Great Study on Black History,"The best thing I like about this documentary is that it is a great study on black History. But it needed to deliver more on what it was supposed to be Jazz Music. I can't believe he left out the great jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Left out Roland Kirk and Keith Jarrett. very little on dave Brubeck. Should have talked about classic Jazz Albums like Kind of blue, Time out (with the song Take Five) A Love Supreme, My favourite things, bitches Brew etc. Also nothing on Milt Jackson and the great Modern Jazz Quartet. Ken burns must realize there's is more to jazz than just the big band swing era. But still a great study on black history which makes it worthwhile just for that alone. and nothing on jazz hip hop. songs like doo bop song(miles Davis) and Jazz thing (gang Starr"

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,SWEET REVENGE,"EVIL DEAD's director Sam Raimi, Tim Burton fave composer Danny Elfman and Oscar winner Frances McDormand contribute to elevate this comic book style vendetta drama.  Liam Neeson (Oscar nominee for SCHINDLER'S LIST) plays a mild-mannered scientist who is attacked by a bunch of thugs after incriminating documentation held by Neeson's girlfriend McDormand.  Left for dead, he manages to get resuscitated by cameo Jenny Agutter, and he embarks on continuing his experiments which dealt with reconstruction of human skin.  This also includes vengeance on the men responsible for his attack.  Neeson's performance is a little over the top (think Vincent Price) but McDormand is very good as the girlfriend, and Colin Friels and the irrepressible Larry Drake (two time Emmy winner for LA LAW) shine as the nasty villains.  Directed with flair by the accomplished Raimi, DARKMAN is one of the earliest vendetta flicks and it still packs a pretty good punch.  Watch for Raimi fave Bruce Campbell in a cameo at the end"

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A great reproduction of a great movie with a great set of Extras,"I need to preface this review with the comment that I am not a John Wayne fan. However ""The Searchers"" is often said to be the Duke's best movie. And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still ""The Searchers"" is a classic and deserves to be better known."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Quite a Wonderful Message in a Bottle,"      There are some films which grip the viewer from their opening seconds, whose beginning sequences are so singularly arresting that the viewer is engaged with no hope of extricating his interest even long after the feature is over.  ""Lost"" is not a film, but from its first seconds it, for lack of a better word, inflicts upon the viewer a narrative power so riveting and intoxicating that no show in the recent history of the medium, if ever for that matter, can match it.  The first episode finds the viewer immediately hurtled with the characters into a beautiful tropical shore which is, at the same time, an abattoir of chaos, wreckage and death.  The characters find themselves grappling with the central problem of survival in their new environment, utterly cut off from the civilized world.    "
dvd,3 of 18,1.0,Can I Get Some Coffee Please!,"If there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was ""History of Violence"" On critics top ten list, everyone was talking about the performances of Viggo and Maria and Ed, so I went into it with high expectations. Honestly it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was ""been there done that"". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off. So I don't recommend this movie, its slow, its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be"
dvd,,5.0,First-Rate Mystery Thriller That Floors You With Real Shocks,"  A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear.  Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around.  It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release!  Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing.  Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make ""Identity"" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time.  If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever.  Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over.  Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers"

dvd,11 of 11,4.0,Good kill,"""A man is generally what he feels himself to be,"" German Sgt. Steiner (James Coburn) tells company commander Capt. Stransky (Maximilian Schell) while outside the bombs ceaselessly explode, kicking gouts of dirt through the rafters of their rickety bunker.  The war, for the German army on the eastern front in the spring of 1943, is going badly.  Stransky, a Prussian aristocrat, has transferred to the bloody front for the express purpose of acquiring a medal, the Iron Cross, awarded to those who display remarkable courage under fire."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Great!,"""Gould's passion and charisma cross all boundaries plus reach out and grab one by the throat.""  That quote by a reviewer sums up the sublime emotion portrayed in this film.  You can see the young Gould growing up and his passion for his music increasing exponentially throughout his relatively short life.   The movie, disjointed, fragmented and disorganized like the genius Gould, is a wonderful artistic statement of the man and his marvelous gifts to all of us.  I listen to his recording of ""The French Suites"" with awe and profound appreciation...and think what it may have been like to be this man, trying to live such an ideal life in such an imperfect and messy world.

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,This is it. It really works!!,"I almost didn't buy the DVD after reading Cheri's review but then I went for it and boy, am I glad I did!  this is NOT a DVD for professionals, which is exactly what I was looking for!! I wanted useful, practical advice to improve my makeup. And this DVD gave me all that and more! It's great and I especially liked the fact that there are 3 well-known celebrity makeup artists. This DVD really has something for everybody, I threw a party last weekend for my girlfriends and we had a blast! We were able to follow the directions and apply the makeup for each of us! I don't know what the problem of the reviewer was, of course it's not for professionals, if you are a makeup artist you're supposed to know these things already! Bottom line, it's a great find and worth every penny"
dvd,,4.0,Paean to a bygone era,"What viewers have to understand about this movie is that it pays homage to all those movie serials of the '30's and '40's and television serials of the '50's. Is it as good as Spielberg's 'Raiders' series? It is the same and different: like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' it is a loving tribute to the early days of filmmaking with more special effects. It is reminiscent of actor Buster Crabbe and the serials 'Buck Rogers' and 'Captain Video.' Like those series, this movie succeeds in capturing the early science fiction view of killer robots and mad scientists. Jude Law and Gwyenth Paltrow are very likable as the lead characters trying to save the world from the evil Dr. Totenkopf. Angelina Jolie and her beautiful lips, however, only make what amounts to a cameo appearance. The basic fact of this movie is this: if you enjoy nostalgia and old movies ('Metropolis', 'Things To Come', etc.), I believe you will enjoy this film immensely. If, on the other hand, your tastes run to more modern films which star the Special Effects people ('Terminator', 'The Matrix', etc.) rather than the actors, or, films rooted in the 'now,' you will be disappointed by this film. I urge you to watch this movie with an open mind and then go out and discover the early days of cinema"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,A Definitive Classic in the Canon,"I wouldn't argue how faithful this production is to Austen's masterpiece, but would procliam that it's indisputably one of the most beautiful, balanced and perfect period films set in the Regency Era - and arguably the best filmic example of Austen's works."

dvd,39 of 41,5.0,One Amazing Night,"I was very fortunate to have been a volunteer at the Musicares Person of the Year Tribute to James Taylor on February 6, 2006. It was a spectacular evening filled with great music and a wonderful feeling. I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I am very much looking forward to it. If you're a fan, this is a must have. Stars performed James' music and talked about what his music and life's work has meant to each of them. I loved Sting's sweet and funny story about evaluating his own musical career prospects after seeing James play for the first time."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Truly beautiful movie with stunning photography,"We have several nature videos and are huge fans of the IMAX movies.  This is by far the best we have seen and we never saw it in an IMAX theatre.  We haven't even popped the second disc into our computer and already we're very happy with our purchase.  The first disc is a regular DVD to play on your DVD player and has stunning photography and a beautiful ""story"" to go with it.  I have a budding marine biologist (13 years old) and another child (15 years old) who's seriously considering going into the same field.  They both loved it.  The music is a perfect accompaniment and it is both sad and entertaining at the same time.  This would be perfect used with the April 3, 2006 issue of TIME magazine, which discusses global warming across the world.  We have coral jewelry and pieces of various types of coral from gem stores.  To think these creatures may not be around in 30 years is rather frightening.  For those shark fans, there is also some stunning photography of a huge group of reef sharks toward the end.  Considering how dangerous these sharks are, it is incredible that this was photographed with no injuries.  Truly a remarkable movie without all the background that some nature movies have on the ""making of the movie"". "

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,A very pleasant surprise !,"I came to see this movie without expecting anything - I wanted to go to the movies with my mother and she wanted to see it. I must say that I am really glad that I agreed. I didn't expect much - I DO NOT like Nicole Kidman (I find that she has a mean face) and I am not really a great fan of Renee Zellweiger or Jude Law. But I was pleasantly surprised and even more - carried away. This is the kind of movie you do not see so much this last time, the kind of stuff that Hollywood mostly stopped to make in the end of 60's. I almost had the impression that the ghosts of Bette Davis (""Jezebel"") and Vivien Leigh (""Gone with the wind"") were watching Nicole Kidman with approval and a friendly smile - it must be the first movie in which I almost forgot that I can't stand her.

Her story is probably one of the saddest that I have heard about so far.  I watched this movie with my best friend, and we both started crying.  It makes you think about how cruel humans really are, and how strong they are, as well.  I HIGHLY recommended this movie.  If you decide to watch it, be sure that you have a box or two of Kleenex with you"

dvd,,5.0,Galileo 7-Does Man Need his Emotions?,"The original Star Trek series came out in the 1960's at a time when the worst horrors of the 20th century were still fresh in everyone's minds-two world wars, the Holocaust, the millions who perished in the Gulag's of the USSR, China and other Communist countries culminating in the omnipresent threat of the total annihilation of humanity by nuclear weapons.  The writers of the series decided to make a statement of how possibly to cope with these things by creating the character of Mr Spock who comes from a race which decided to eliminate all emotion and to live only by ""logic"" and ""reason"".  However, the question is always hovering over Spock as to whether this is really possible, i.e. can man really change his nature.  Spock's friendly adversary, Dr McCoy does not believe this is possible and in the ""Galileo 7"" both men are put in a crisis situation where Spock is finally given command and he can now put his theories on human perfection to use.  This show has all the elements of Star Trek at its finest: life or death drama, fear of the unknown, military command decisions, loyalty of friends to each other, interference from superior authorities and others.  The script and acting are splendid and the first-time viewer will be riveted to his TV screen. This proves that a good story and fine actors can make a great production even with low-budget sets (something the later versions of ST forget).  "

Likewise, I am pleased that at long last these episodes are available to see over and over and over and ...; you get the idea.

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,You know you wanna watch it,"I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to review this show, as it's already been analyzed to death (and beyond) by people smarter and better-versed than I, but what the hey.  Suffice it to say that season one of The Sopranos is easily one of the best debut seasons a TV show has had in recent memory, slightly better than season one of The Shield in my book and just behind season one of Arrested Development (RIP).  Befitting its mob-opera status, it combines an epic scope with a wrenching human element in a way few shows can, and in a sad commentary on the state of TV comedy these days, it also manages to be one of the funniest shows around, laden with irony and gallows-humor dialgoue.  Every episode is as complex and detailed as a season of most shows, constantly developing a whole universe of characters who are deeply flawed, often tormented, and undeniably human.  "

HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LO"
dvd,13 of 14,5.0,Anthony Hopkins gives a great potrayal of Paul,I think that Anthony Hopkins gives a terrific portrayal of Paul (not that I've ever met Paul....:)
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,Vietnam without the cynical viewpoint,"The main thing that sticks with me after watching this excellent depiction of the early days of the Vietnam War is towards the end of the movie (after the battle) when the press helicopter lands and all the reporters gather around Gibson and the other soldiers and start asking inane questions. It just seemed so jarring and surreal. I mean what the hell do you even say after an experience like that. I kept thinking, in regards to the reporters, that they so couldn't even understand ... and I was only watching the battle (in the comfort of my living room), not fighting in it!! "
dvd,,4.0,"excellent, halarious, classic!!","pauly shore is halarious in this sidesplitting comedy. read above for what the movie's about, anyway, on with the review."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Very Nice!,"Very easy to follow great, and fairly quick stretchs for the back! Love it"
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Cool series,"An epic sci-fi phenomenon began in 1966 when the first season of ""Star Trek"" began to broadcast on U.S. televisions. Created by the legendary writer Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991), the series was intended to run for five years detailing the missions of the mammoth starship known as the U.S.S. Enterprise, which was only one of several starships that were part of the United Federation of Planets' Starfleet. Unfortunately, the series was prematurely cancelled after only three complete seasons in spite of efforts of Gene Roddenberry, letter-writing campaigns conducted by fans to keep the show alive and 5 Emmy Award nominations. Ironically, it was only six weeks after the final third-season episode was broadcast (6/3/1969) that astronauts Neil Armstrong and 'Buzz' Aldrin became the first human beings to ever set foot on an extraterrestrial world, Earth's moon, on 7/20/1969. Then, instead of being forgotten after cancellation, in syndication, ""Star Trek"" began to rise in popularity in the early 1970's to such an extent that Paramount Pictures began toying with the idea of resurrecting the show. Instead, following the extremely successful 1977 sci-fi blockbuster film ""Star Wars"" (written and directed by George Lucas), Paramount Pictures did resurrect the show in the form of several big-screen films beginning in 1979. With a new generation being introduced to the fantastic universe created by Gene Roddenberry, more ""Star Trek"" television series were created. In total, there have been six ""Star Trek"" television series (5 live-action, 1 animated) and ten big-screen films; but all of them owe their thanks not only to Gene Roddenberry, but to the original ""Star Trek"" series cast and the many fans that kept the original show in syndication long after it was cancelled"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,lacked some heart,This was a good action flick but I felt that there was nobody encouraging eachother on the SWAT team or anybody doing anything or saying anything with heart.  The film was one of the best action films out there though and I did like the scene where the young swat memebers are training to be on the team.  The end of the movie is pretty cool and Samuel L. Jackson played a great leader for the SWAT team just like he was a great coach on Coach Carter.  When guns or bombs go off the sourround sound is exhilirating.  The commentary was dissapointing though.  Buy it if you like action flicks.  God bless you and America
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,SWEET!!!,"Wow, after seeing both the Director's Cut and the original, i know which i would choose.  The Director's Cut sheds so much more light on the goings on in Jerusulem then the other version.  It should also be said that with this new light comes a nearly completely different story line.  All of the main events from the original movie happen in this one, but this cut is so much more detailed and far easier to get into than the original version.  I would definetly spend the extra 4 bucks for this version of the movie"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A lovely movie that needs to take out bad language, I have been looking for this movie for a while.  I had seen it on t.v. a long time ago.  I was thrilled that I found it on Amazon and bought it. 
dvd,9 of 10,4.0,Frightening faith,"George Carlin got it right when he described America as a great country with a strange culture. The peculiar form of ""praise the Lord and pass the ammunition"" Christianity that exists in this country has done its part to contribute to the weird underbelly of the American cultural landscape -- from Jack Chick's Christian comic tracts to snake-handling congregations to the subject of the documentary ""Hell House."""
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Classic,"This movie is a classic. If you haven't seen it or heard of it, buy it now"
dvd,4 of 6,1.0,"Freeze drying.. fat frying.. chicken choking dvd. OK, it's not THAT bad, but buyer beware","I purchased this dvd as a gift recently and although I'm not exactly JT's number one fan, I enjoyed the performances: very professional, intimate... and his constipated Popeye, white-boy-blues facial contortions are always good for a laugh. For those enamored of his work, this would seem to be a mandatory purchase. I'm writing this review, however, to alert potential buyers to the fact that there seems to be a problem with the disc. A previous reviewer has mentioned the synchronization problem; I noticed that a little bit, but honestly, it didn't seem too blatant (not NEARLY as bad as the dvd of ""Stop Making Sense"", anyway). The problem with this disc seems to be the audio. I immediately noticed an odd clicking sound throughout the dvd (coming out of the left channel); it seems most obvious on the last 4 or 5 songs. At first I thought it was some sonic anomaly associated with playing in the barn or maybe the clanging of a background singer's jewelry, but on the very last track -- where James is playing solo in a different setting -- the noise is still present. I've talked with Sony a couple of times about the problem, but as of yet have not gotten any confirmation that there IS a problem or that it is being remedied. I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this glitch or if perhaps it is unique to the disc that I bought. At any rate, I just thought I'd give a heads up to those thinking of getting the dvd. From my perspective, the sync issue is not sufficent to avoid the disc, but the audio problem might be"
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Nice to see these shows again!,"I remember watching these shows when I was younger.  (I'm 53 now.)  Haven't seen them in so long it's like they're new all over again.  As soon as I started watching, all the characters came back to me!  Nice to watch comedy shows that aren't are good clean fun and suitable for anybody's viewing"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,good remake ,"If you enjoyed the original movie, this is a nice treat.  The story is similar but there are enough differences to keep you in suspence thourgh out the movie"
dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Did I really just spend my night watching this?,"I must have been really desperate for mindless entertainment! I agree, there were some pretty good old songs though."
dvd,,5.0,Praisebaby DVD,My daughter loves the Praisebaby DVD!  It was a great price and great quality.  Thank you for making it easy for us to find this product and giving us a great deal
dvd,2 of 4,1.0,Ouch,Let me start by saying that I love indipendent features and support them fully. 
dvd,1 of 1,1.0,Poor Tidal Wave- FAKE,I really felt that this move deserves less than a star.  Its plot was not done well and the use of a nuclear missle to cause a tidal wave does not hold much water - Sorry for the pun.  I would not waist my money and buy this.  The entire plot and suspense was not good.  I watched it and felt I waisted my time.  I did not really go for it
dvd,4 of 5,2.0,go with  less disks...and a less all over the place set,I thought this set would be nice seeing as there are several well known names in it and a complete 5 discs...the biggest problem is until you get to disk 3 you are watching for 30 seconds then 2 minutes then 15 seconds...going thru menu after menu...I cant say anything about disk 4 and five all though it looks like these are for kids and ladies...I have the old Bob mann videos which basically run for an hour straight and found them to be much better...sometimes more is not better
dvd,8 of 10,4.0,OK for a change,"This workout is a little too bland for me, and while each day has a different workout, there are some repeats of sections. The cardio is the same no matter which day you do it; same with the upper and lower body toning as well as the yoga. Some days you have a choice which workout you want to do and it will occupy you. I enjoy this for something different; I fit this in one week out of every month or two just to shake up my routine a little bit"
dvd,3 of 9,1.0,"Ghetto Monkey, Modification Morons with Mufflers","I would rate this piece of film trash a ""0"", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides ""dawg"" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity"
dvd,,5.0,Philosophical apocalypse or just carnage?,"A beautifully animated anime, told with its own hypnotic type rhythm drawing you into the narrative. But what the hell is that narrative saying or about? Is there a moral or message in any of it? Why r there different qualities and flaws in different characters?"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Better than Next Friday, but not the first.","For the second straight time, Mike Epps replaces Tucker, but he plays Craig's (Ice Cube) cousin. Don't get me wrong, he's funny. But come on. Thats Chris Tucker. But anyway, this time the two are owing rent money by the nightfall or the landlords diesel son Damon is going to set them straight. One thing about him. He should try setting himself straight first. The two are security guards in a mini mall and Day-Day (Epps) is taking his job a little too seriously. Until finally they catch two people stealing at the store next door to they're fathers barbeque, they invite the pimp owner to come to they're Christmas Party that night. Unfortunately for him, he runs into Damon in the bathroom and the rest is just crazy. Many funny parts, but still think it could've been funnier with Tucker"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Challenging Workout For The Lower Body,I really like this workout with its focus on the legs and buns.  This one provides noticeable results
dvd,,5.0,one of the best movies ever made.,"Singles... This movie touches on almost everything that could happen in a relationship. The characters are great, the senarios are real. It's a great movie. this is one to watch alone, or with someone else. or with a group of people. I love it."
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Dark Star Review,"This film still made me laugh quite a bit, but it is something best watched while slightly intoxicated I think, at least it was for my friends.  There is a fantastic elevator scene and the fact that it was made so long ago makes it a bit of a novelty for science fiction fans.  I'd compare it only slightly to Killer Klowns from Outer Space or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Bestest Movie in the whole wide world!,This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. Period
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,An unusual sci-fi allegory,"This film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way.  The plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally.  Instead, what Logan's Run offers is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state.  Some of the scenes are riveting, such as the early depiction of sanitized mass murder carried out in a spectacular ceremony.  There are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death.  The world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic.  The environment is a kind of shallow, Disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape.  The implicit subtext of the movie, that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap, is well taken.          "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,1900 is One of my favorites. A really fresh look at life.,This was something completely different. What Hollywood doesn't produce anymore. A quirky somewhat melancholy movie that has many fascinating visual and auditory highlights as well as some darker moments that grab you and keep you thinking.
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,As addictive as season 1 and 2,"After many hours searching the internet for the third series I finally came across it. I ended up watching the whole thing in a day and a half! I guess the only thing I didn't like about it was I felt as though I had missed something between the last episode of season 2 and the first episode of season 3 because it took a while to figure out what was going on. Needless to say I quickly got over that became rivited again to thise series that I would be completely lost without if it ended. All your favourite characters are back and a few introductions too. I laughed, I cried and most importantly.... I LOVED IT!"
dvd,,5.0,Restoration makes a big difference,"The restored and expanded Major Dundee starring Charleton Heston is a must for Western fans. This version far exceeds the original cut (butchered by the studio) that was offered to theaters in 1964. The film has also been re-scored beautifully. If you have seen this one on TV and hated it, please revisit the film"
dvd,29 of 32,4.0,"Joe Montana was a quarterback, you crazy @**hole","I would call this a typical Sandler movie.  It's probably not his best movie, but it definitely has its moments, with a good number of quotable lines."
dvd,,5.0,One of my all time favorite films,"I am by no means a fan of musicals but I have to say I love ""Little Shop of Horrors"", or at least Frank Oz's adaptation. Rick Moranis plays the dorky but sweet Seymore who works in a flower shop with Ellen Greene as Audrey and Vincent Gardenia as Mr. Mushnik, his boss. Seymore is secretly in love with Audrey who is in an abusive relationship with a demented dentist played by the hilarious Steve Martin who is really over the tops in this film. One day, Seymore stumbles upon a new kind of plant. He takes it back to the store with him. He names the plant Audrey II. For awhile the plant appears that it is not going to make it but then one day it suddenly comes alive when Seymore discovers the plant likes blood. Eventually the plant grows and his blood thirst even more so. I absolutely love the musical numbers in the film. I especially love the number where Seymore fantasizes about a live with Audrey. The performances were wacky and over the top. I hope someday this dvd will get a proper dvd treatment. It richly deserves so"
dvd,10 of 14,4.0,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this workout DVD.  I love Jillian's attitude and believe that she offers sound advise.  It's really a fantastic workout combining both cardio and strength training.  BUT, for people very out of shape (me), this is a difficult routine to complete.  I was quite active in my 20's and then off and on during my 30's with both cardio and weight lifting so excercise isn't new to me.  Part of me says to keep trying this routine but I feel with it being so difficult I won't stick to it.  Maybe that's a cop out but I wish Jillian would offer something for us beginers.  Personally, I plan to alternate this with other, less intense, workout DVD's (that would be 90% of them) and challenge myself to become healthy enough to complete this routine.  It sure would feel like an accomplishment!  If you are in shape and really want to lose weight and tone up, this is a 5 star DVD."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Fantas-tic!,"Disney's 1940 critically-acclaimed film Fantasia is breath-taking.  Not only is it my favorite Disney film, it's amazing combining of dreamy art and classical music is awe-inspiring and totally unique.  I remember as a child the closing episode was one I could not watch for such a long time at nighttime because it scared me so much.  Brilliant, in every aspect"
dvd,5 of 23,1.0,faulty version...,"I bought a copy of this film, but was disappointed to find that I couldn't watch past chapter 22-23; the image wouldn't play, no matter what I did.  So I bought another.  Same problem.  There's a line across the top of the DVD, so there's likely something wrong with it.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with every disc, but I bought 2 faulty ones.  I hope yours isn't messed up too.  The movie is 5 stars, but I give it 1 star since I couldn't finish the film due to technical problems - there is no excuse for this"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Sorry to nitpick but...,"When I logged on I was directed to a ""recommendations based on my previous purchases"" page. The selection at the top was Eric Johnson's recently released, ""Live from Austin Texas"" DVD. Above the track listing was a line that read, ""From the Actor."" Just a heads up, folks. Yes, there is an actor by that name; however, this DVD is a release of an Austin City Limits performance by the legendary guitar virtuoso, Eric Johnson -- NOT the actor. For anyone even remotely interested in music and/or guitar,  this DVD is a must have. To write that this is a recording of a brilliant performance simply doesn't cut it -- prepared to be awed and for anyone interested in learning to play guitar, prepare to be inspired."
dvd,5 of 13,4.0,"Yo, this is tight","I'm a bboy that also wanted to learn some locking, popping, and hip hop. I thought the Groovin series was the tightest thing out there. I had to give 'em some props. These guys are dope"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Greatest comeback in the history of the game!,"Being a card-carrying member (literally) of Red Sox Nation, I'm embarrassed to admit that it's taken me this long to pick up this box set."
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Mutiny on the Bounty,"MGM's adaptation of the famous Nordhoff/ Hall book is given top shelf treatment here with the sneering Laughton as the definitive Bligh, and the studios biggest star, Gable, playing Christian with gusto (and, notably, without his trademark mustache). Grand, sweeping entertainment suitable for the whole family"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The Title Does not say it all...,"Do not get caught up on the title alone because this movie is way more than one black woman's anger and tirades...it is also a thing of Beauty, Emotions, and also the character of Madea's and her Antics.  Diary of a Mad Black Woman is truly...Food For The Soul"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,DIfferent,Great anime. Very different than the generic types we are starting to see alot of today. I reccomend very highly for anyone looking for a thought provoking series and overall fun anime to watch. Not many series out there like this.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,In your face and gripping,"Just a great movie.  A breath of fresh air, because unlike most of the films about girls, boys or men are the center of everything and this film focused on the relationships and love between the girls, and it accurately portrays the feelings of lost, uncontented teens who know that there has to be something more."
dvd,30 of 37,5.0,Sweet and sentimental,"Even though the movie is billed as a cult flic supposedly full of horror and violence, it is in fact a very sweet tale of coming to age with a obligatory happy ending. Since it is a Japanese movie, it is full of turning people into sushi scenes obviously, but this is as expected."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Down to You,I love this movie. It is a modern day romantic comedy that anyone will enjoy watching
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,G-men reveiw,"This is one of the verry best films I've ever seen. Cagney displays a superb acting job, that is a perfect match for a incredible screenplay.This is indeed one of James Cagney's best jobs ever for sure"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,It's Supernatural...,The first season of Supernatural was a breath of fresh air in my life.
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,R and H Cinderella,"this was a staple on CBS when I was a boy, and I was delighted to find it on DVD.   The picture quality is excellent, and it enabled me to relive a bit of my childhood"
dvd,0 of 2,1.0,"and now, debuting in my list of the 10 worst movies ive ever seen ...","omigod, did this garbage really pass for ""hot"" 2 decades back? director albert magnoli has zero sense of pacing, editing, acting, story telling, etc. and prince is as bad an actor as ive ever seen. no, i take that back -- ive seen apollonia (who herein makes her role in ""falcon crest"" look like lilian gish)! i will not comment on the musical score; if you like it, more power to you and go buy the album. but a movie where clarence williams, III gives the strongest performance? well, thats not a movie i ever want to sit thru again"
dvd,2 of 5,2.0,The Brat Pack and those enormous granny panties,"This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall."
dvd,,5.0,Awesome,"Well, most people know what this is.  I will look at the production a bit.  This DVD is something sort of new in the Concert venues.  This feels like an intimate setting and the camera work is very much NOT like an MTV type of video or of a typical Concert video."
dvd,,5.0,Paul Shines On,"Well, he's done it again.  Paul McCartney pulls my heart strings and I just can't stop crying.  It sure makes it hard to sing the lyrics along with him.  I'm a mess.  "
dvd,,5.0,Moving tribute to George.,"What a talented song writer, and what a great concert tribute.  Highlights for me included Sam Brown's rousing version of ""Horse To The Water"", Gary Brooker's up tempo ""Old Brown Shoe"" and Ringo Starr's excellent performance of ""Photograph"".  All in all, every performance on here was excellent, and it was great to see Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr play together on stage. "
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,I have to write this.,I love this DVD!!  And so does my 3 yr old.  
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,An Afternoon Delight,"Whether it's watching network news or playin' ""Pull My Finger,"" it doesn't take much to make me laugh.  More importantly, hit me between the eyes with ribald, sophomoric humor--humor as meaningful as a clown reading Shakespeare--and I'm good to go.  Don't give me Woody Allen; give me Cheech & Chong and a box of pizza rolls."
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Show Boat's a Coming,"George Sidney's SHOW BOAT is exceptionally done.  The opening scene alone will make you want to get up and sing along.  The music of Jerome Kern, Aldolph Deutsch, and Conrad Salinger as well as the storyline brings much enjoyment to the film. Kathryn Grayson (Nora Hawks) and Howard Keel (Gaylord Ravenal) headline the film, and the movie revolves around their musical partnership as well as what happens offstage.  Nora, who later takes the stage name ""Magnolia"", falls for Gaylord, a Mississippi gambler who happens to sing.  Their partnership is somewhat storybook, but is not the case.  Gaylord's gambling becomes a problem, which eventually breaks-up both their professional and personal partnership.  Joe E. Brown (Cap'n Andy Hawks) nearly steals the show during the New Year's Eve scene as he continuously blares out, ""Happy New Year,"" while William Warfield's rendition of ""Old Man River"" is riveting and powerful.  "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Best of the best,This DVD set is a must have for any person who considers themself to be a wrestling fan. Your life is incomplete until you own Tombstone. The Undertaker basks in his dark glory in what must surely become the bench mark in wrestling DVDs.
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,Loved the Harts,"I remember the the 70's well. This show was my absolute favorite show. I loved the chemistry between Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers. It came so naturally that they didn't have to work at it. You just knew they were having fun doing the show!! Who doesn't dream of having more money than they could ever spend, and also having the choice of whether to work or not!! Let's not forget Max, who took care of them - he sure had his hands full! He was more family than servant - and we loved him just as much. He just added to the show's charm. TV these days has become so much more serious and reality based. What fun to lose yourself in a show that was full of fun, charm, and bit of crime solving too! The show may seem dated nowadays but who cares! It's still a lot of fun to watch. My favorite episodes from this season were the one where Jonathon lost his memory and the one where he played his own uncle, Fritz Von Hart. What fun!! I can't wait to get this DVD set. Hopefully it won't be another year before Season 3 is released"
dvd,10 of 13,1.0,Don't Waste Your Time,"Don't buy this DVD. They've included some of the exact same sketches already shown on Seasons 1-3 right down to the music performances at the end. On one episode, they showed Another Bad Creation performing, they were on Season 2. Just watch it onn tv"
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,The 2nd Universal Horror Masterpiece,"After Bela Lugosi became a movie star playing Dracula, he was offered the role of the Frankenstein monster, but turned it down & so a other horror movie star emerged, Boris Karloff as the manufactured mistunderstood monster, truly one of the greatest horror films of all time, Karloff brings terrifying perfection to the role. A great non dialogue performance. A masterpiece of how science can be misused. If you like classic universal horror see Mary Shelley's shocking novel story in the motion picture"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Underworld 2,Kate Beckinsale is even more sensual than in the 1st movie. Special effects are impressive. Lots of action scenes
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,Elated to see Marvin,"I used to watch live performances of Michael Jackson and people would be falling all over the place. I'd always wonder ""How in the world can you connect with an artist THAT much?""  Those were the days before I was old enough to understand what music can do to someone's soul.  Marvin Gaye makes my heart beat faster and my eyes water. I am CRAZY about that man's voice. When I walked into a bookstore, I snatched this DVD up so fast you would've thought I was on fast forward.  "
dvd,6 of 7,1.0,"Real Characters And Situations Need Not Apply--Another Film With An Annoying Compendium Of Character ""Types""","Here we go again (send me your hate mail).  ""Mind The Gap"" is another (of many) films that people discover and love.  With a large colorful cast, many life lessons to be learned, and a rollicking feel good ending--oh, this must be a crowd pleaser!  People will embrace this film, it'll make them feel good--but rarely have I witnessed a movie so false and so manipulative at every turn.  I recently said in another review that ""quirky"" is the new curse of the indie film scene.  There are nice quirky pictures--but most films of this genre tend to give you character types instead of real people.  We're supposed to find oddball mannerisms irresistible and relatable.  Now a straight comedy can sometimes pull this off, but it is far more difficult for a film trying to have a serious side.  It's a house of cards--because you have ""types"" and not ""people,"" real emotional payoff is hard to come by.  In ""Mind the Gap,"" this house is also built on overstylized and unbelievable dialogue.  "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,This is a very cool movie,It is one of the underrated Clint Eastwood films. The story if interesting and the action is riveting
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Inner Conflict,"I thought this movie did a wonderful job of showing the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, but it also showed the inner conflict of the Suicide Bombers. This movie in no way promotes this terrorist practice, but takes you inside the minds of two suicide bombers and their culture"
dvd,12 of 17,4.0,The Great American Songwriter,"As a friend of the Late, Great, Townes Van Zandt; and as someone who saw him perform many times and who collected all of his recordings, I can tell you from first-hand experience that his story is one of the most compelling of any singer/songwriter the U.S. has ever produced. An amazing talent, with a bent for self-destruction, Townes was a unique and singular voice in the Pop Culture Era.  His story has needed to be told, warts and all, and I give this DVD, grudgingly, four stars because it will hopefully introduce more people to this icon of American Music. However, there are several flaws in the film. One glaring misrepresentation is that this is an ""Original"" documentary-style film. In truth, this film relies heavily on clips from ""Heartworn Highways"", a 1975 film that was released in ""Art Houses"" in major cities across America back in the late 70's, early 80's. ""Heartworn Highways"" was a film about the Guy/Susanna Clark, Townes, Steve Earle, Rodney Crowell contingent of ""New Breed"" singer/songwriters that split their time between Austin and Nashville singing together, drinking together, and buddying up; just having a great time. For someone who is familiar with Townes's story, there is very little here that hasn't already been told. This is really for people who have never heard of Townes or who have heard of him through the wind and are curious about who he was.  There still is a lot missing here, as the characters that were close to him, like ex-wives and musical associates, are never really defined in the film. These kinds of omissions diminsh the full story that still needs to be told about Townes. There is a lack of depth and direction to this film that will make it difficult for people to tie together, with any kind of chronology, the pieces of this complex artist's life. There are very few, if any, details about who is who in the film. There isn't much of a reference, if any, as to where and when certain clips were taken in order to give the story a sense of history and movement. Like I said before, though, it's better than not having anything out there at the present time about this great American Poet and visionary."
dvd,5 of 37,2.0,Way way OVERRATED and SCHLOCKY!  Amateurish!,"The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money"
dvd,8 of 8,2.0,Disappointing box set.....,"I will admit right off the bat that I am a B-Movie fan when it comes to action films. I especially like b-action movie franchises. I own the American Ninja series, The Delta Force trilogy, Missing in Action trilogy, etc. I liked the Kickboxer films and I always ment to get them on DVD but I kept putting them off. When I heard there was a DVD box set coming out I quickly pre-ordered the item without knowing the nature of the set. I came out extremely disappointed."
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,The Lady Eve,"Preston Sturges' crazy genius jumps off the screen in this movie. Originally a writer, he had an off-the-wall sensibility way ahead of his time.  Barbara Stanwyck is at the peak of her appeal here, and Coburn is incongruously cuddly as her wily father.  Fonda, of all people, is a hoot in a rare comedic turn"
dvd,18 of 19,4.0,dark city ,"Dark City is an inspired film. Rufus Sewell is always worth watching and delivers a thoroughly believable performance within the incredible world of Dark City. John Hurt is a good hard-boiled police detective with the proper degree of angst. The sets, the special effects, but above all the storyline keep one guessing and fascinated. A definite cult classic, which leaves lingering questions and a vague, but enticing disquiet in the viewer"
dvd,6 of 8,4.0,Amusing Little Sex Comedy.,"Ed (Jay Mohr) and Alice (Julianne Nicholson) have been a happy couple for 5 years, and now they plan to get married. But Alice feels uneasy with her limited sexual experience and sees her last chance at an adventurous lifestyle disappearing. So Alice  proposes that she and Nick sleep with other people until their wedding date. Nick is reluctant, but Alice's first steps at wayward romance encourage him. Nick and Alice's experiment with infidelity yields predictable, but entertaining, results."
dvd,,5.0,"Loved ""Rent""!!!","I saw the Broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the DVD, I think that everyone should see this movie over and over again.  Chris Columbus has done a wonderful job bringing this musical to film and keeping Jonathan Larson's ideals and thought-provoking view and dreams alive.  The actors are first rate!  They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable.  "
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,LOVING YOU IS LIKE FOOD TO MY SOUL!!!!,"THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE ABOUT FAMILY. THIS MOVIE ABOUT A FAMILY STRUGGLING TRONG TO GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER AND TOGETHERNESS, LOVING EACH OTHER, AND BEING THERE FOR ONE ANOTHER IN HARD TIMES BUT THE FAMILY STICKS TOGETHER AND STAYS TOGETHER AND OVERCOME THEIR FAMILY PROBLEMS"
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Blood for blood and by the gallons,"Movie aside, this DVD set was great.  There are two versions of this film to choose from on this DVD; the original, and a directors cut.  I loved the new version with the added scenes (even though they aren't significant to the plot it's nice to be able to watch them).  The additional bonus features are extensive, and Rodriguez's cooking class was also quite fun."
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,"Before Gladiator, there was...Ben-Hur","Ben-Hur set the bar for period films of today, and although the graphics in this film fail in comparision there is yet to be a film of this magnitude that can hold a candle to it.  Ben-Hur is truly one of a kind and one that will never be repeated.  Telling the story of wealthy Jewish Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) as his political ideas clash with his old friend and now Roman official Messala (Stephen Boyd) and cost him his friendship and almost his life.  After their outing Messala uses anything he can to put Judah away, and when an accident almost costs the governer his life Messala finally has his excuse to send Judah to the gallows and throw his mother and sister in prison.  Judah vows to get his revenge, and much like Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator, Ben-Hur is given his chance in the most unique of circumstances.  This epic is the best of the best, and while others have come close (Gladiator coming the closest) there is still yet to come another Ben-Hur.  At 4 hours in length this may not be a one seating type film, but it's well worth the time is takes to watch it through.  With brilliant performances on all fronts, Ben-Hur stands alone as one of the most worthy films to ever grace the oscars and one of the best films to ever take top honors.  A worthy addition to your DVD collection.  You won't be dissapointed"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Good Movie and then some,"It took me awhile to get around to viewing this, primarily because I had a hard time imagining that the subject matter could be converted into an engaging screenplay. Well, they did it... in a big way. Everything is right with this film and it's easy to understand the well deserved accolades it received. The portrayal of Mr Murrow is downright incredible. The movie speaks volumes about courage in the face of powerful intimidation and will be always relevant"
dvd,8 of 15,1.0,What are the other reviewers on?,"I got this film by default as it was coupled with the ""Legend of 1900"" in a 2-DVD pack. I thought goodie ... I really like Tim Roth and in ""1900"" he is sparkiling, brilliant and ultimately very moving."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Astroid,It has Michael Biehn in it so it is great - did see it on TV (and taped it) and wanted it without commercials also
dvd,,4.0,Really 3 and a Half Stars.....,Sometimes life sucks. But try living in the 50's and reciving a dear john letter. And then getting murdered. Crap like that is what makes up the small cult flick a geniune one. The story is about a girl and a soroty house that is going to a party! OH YEAH! DRUGS SEX AND ALCHOL!! LIFE IS GOOD!  Anyways.... so the teens start being whorory and skanky and start to die! yay! So the best scene in the movie is when the survivor is running from the killer and when he stops on the stairs and looks at her i gt creeped out. I say it is a rent but what the hell do i know!!!
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,funny,"I really like this movie, although I don't count it as one of my top, top favorites.  But it is really funny and worth seeing.  I don't really know or care anything about Nixon's presidency.  But I saw this movie because I love the retro 70s music and clothes and atmosphere, and that is what I love about this film.  The songs are great, the clothes are sooo horribly awesome, and the characters are so well done.  Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams portrayed two dimwit ""stupid teenage girls"" with perfection.  Read everyone else's reviews, they already said it all"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Absolutley Pertinent ,"Banned from American and British broadcast, this documentary is an essential look at the ""other side."" Whether you support the US war in Iraq, the informed citizen would benefit from a look at the control room."
dvd,,4.0,This is a Good Film,"This film is very good and one of the few movies I have ever seen that actually gave me the creeps.  Very strange.  That scene where the couple is walking through the streets on that island and they began to see odd people who look as if they have been taking too much cod liver oil is pretty creepy.  Forget about weather you like Lovecraft or not, this is a good movie and should be seen."
dvd,,5.0,Great DVD set!,This DVD set is awesome and well worth the money.  It was promptly delivered in a couple of days.  I was actually shocked it arrived so quickly!  If you are a Pink Floyd fan you will definitely enjoy this concert box set.  The lighting designers on this show really know how to use the Vari-lite's to their full potential.  Definitely check it out
dvd,,4.0,So Dark The Con Of Man,"...but the movie was pretty good. I found myself highly disappointed in the book, and almost wasn't able to finish it. The characters were flat, the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages, and not a true story, so I wasn't sure what to make of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised though, to enjoy the movie immensely. It was long, but it kept the pace going throughout. The subtitling in the Latin and French was a bit mundane to drudge through, but it made the movie a bit more 'believable' than everyone speaking English when the main character is actually French."
dvd,4 of 12,2.0,so many gaps in the story,"This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story"
dvd,,5.0,Excellent,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't.  I really enjoyed this, it's a great story"
dvd,,4.0,Fair compilation; good value for your money,"This music video compilation is a must have for any 80's music fan. The main problem with most such video compilations out there these days is that they are too scanty. The average music video DVD contains like 5-7 songs at the most. Wouldn't you rather spend a few dollars more and get a disc which contains more good hits in one place? And this collection does exactly that. It puts (videos of) 14 of the 80's best hits in one place. Agreed, there is still a lot more space on a DVD to get three times as many videos, but this collection stands out compared to the other collections out there today. The other good thing is that there were a lot of one-hit-wonder bands back then that you cannot really find videos of now e.g. Dan Hartman or Berlin. You can easily get a DVD of Tears For Fears videos but not these other bands. Even if you could many people wouldn't buy them because they only had a few good songs to their credit. So it is great to get your hands on a DVD where you can find all these good numbers in one place. In a nutshell: there's room for improvement, but that shouldn't blind you to what it's worth and pass it over"
dvd,,5.0,Buy this!!,"This stand-up is one of my all time favorites.  You definitely have to buy this because it's something you'll want to watch over and over again, as well as introduce it to friends and relatives.  It's hilarious!"
dvd,,5.0,What a DVD!,"I was a Road Warrior fan back when they were in the AWA. In fact I have an original VHS tape they released of them when they were in the AWA. SO to see this coming out was great. The documentary was almost tear jerking in the end and the extras are awesome. They have matches from Georgia Championship Wrestling, NWA, AWA, Japan, WCW, and the WWF/WWE. I loved it and I would recommend it"
dvd,9 of 12,5.0,We're all a bunch of suckers.,"I once read a review of 1984 by George Orwell that basically said that anyone who sees the book as a diatribe against Communism is intellectually dim. I feel the same way about those who see Bob Roberts as nothing more than a stab at the Right. That's what Tim Robbins intended, for sure, but it's not all that we should take away from it. Look at how the character used catchy songs and the right buzzwords to manipulate his followers and the media. It's what all of our major candidates (Dem. and Rep.) are guilty of. The major theme of this movie is thus: If we want better candidates, we have to pay better attention. The movie definately more than makes the case for that"
dvd,,4.0,Better Than I Expected,"Considering all the bad press Tom Cruise and this film got earlier this year I wasn't expecting this film to be all that great.  I mean, by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left.  Granted, this film is not the most original of plots, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, what a great job J. J. Abrams did, and what a great cast the film had.  It was much better than I expected it would be.  As you watch the film, you can definitely see J. J.'s ""Alias"" touches all over the place.  There were even a few times when I wondered if Sydney Bristow was going to jump, which would have been SO cool.  Tom Cruise too a lot of crap for this film, whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics I don't know, but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish.  If you're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted, M:I3 is your film"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Van Damme takes it to a whole new level...,"If you would of said Van Damme back in 1990,people would of responded he was in Bloodsport or Kickboxer which were simply martial art type of films.Van Damme stepped up to the level with Schwarzenegger and Stallone in this box-office hit.Even though jail movies have been done before like Stallones ""Lockup"" and Sean Penn's ""Bad Boy's"" Death Warrant took it into overtime,having a convincing villian in the ""Sandman"" and a believing hero in Van Damme.An undercover cop in jail?Dangerous if you ask me but Van Damme fights the odds and comes up victorious in an all out supercharged war.With fast pace kicks and fight sequences Van Damme is your ticket to nonstop action.."

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,"An Intricate, Clever And Satisfying Con Game","This Argentine film has to be one of the great con movies...intricate, funny, difficult to see where it's going, and satisfying. Juan (Gaston Pauls), a young, naive-looking con artist, tries to play a bill-changing scam twice at a convenience store and gets caught. A smooth-looking older guy, Marcos (Ricardo Darrin), who was watching, suddenly steps forward, says he's a cop and hustles Juan out the door. But it turns out Marcos is a con artist, too; a lot more experienced, it seems, who is looking for a partner. He's willing to show Juan the ropes. When Marcos and Juan walk down a busy street, Marcos points out all the hustles. The scammers are all around them. ""They're there,"" he says to Juan, ""but you can't see them. That's what it's all about. They're there, but they aren't. So mind your briefcase, your door, your window, your car, your savings. Mind your rear. Because they're there and they'll always be."" ""Thieves,"" says Juan. ""No...that's what everybody calls them. They are spitters, breakers, skin workers, blind fronts, hoisters, hooks, stalls, petermans, night raiders, mustard-chuckers, fences, operators, swindlers. I'm hungry. Let's go to my office and get a meal."" And they step into a near-by bar where Marcos owes money."
dvd,,5.0,Bridget's one of us!,"Most single women can relate to at least a page or two out of Bridget's diary.  Who, at one time or another, hasn't battled weight gain, a craving for cigarettes or fallen head over heels for the ""wrong"" guy?  Even though Bridget and Mr. Darcy set off sparks from the beginning, the fireworks tend to create friction rather than romance; however, there's little doubt the two of them will eventually get together.  Like a good friend, we ""hold Bridget's hand,"" as she discovers what a scoundrel Daniel Cleaver really is.  Along the way, we meet her loyal, if somewhat loopy friends; her endearingly eccentric parents; and of course, the dreamy Mr. Darcy.  Gather the girls around and spend a Friday night with a great gal pal, Bridget Jones! "
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,One of the best films ever made. (This review is also written at IMDB.com),"The story continues with more people stuck in a Cube-like prison, but is that all? No. We actually learn that there are workers watching the prisoners in the Cube. Until one of the workers realize that there is an innocent woman stuck in the Cube. Will he stay on the evil side or will he join the good side with the prisoners? Cube was one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made, with interesting characters, awesome gore and well crafted suspense. I gave that a 10. Cube 2 was nothing. It takes a good premise (eight strangers stuck in a hypercube) but adds this alternate universe crap, with unoriginal traps, annoying characters, insulting ending and badly done CGI. In fact, too much badly done CGI. I gave that a 3 because that are some good points. The rooms are nice and the music score is not bad, but that doesn't save the movie from becoming total trash. Cube Zero is different. It wants you to ignore Cube 2 and shows you what made the original worked; suspense, good characters, well done effects and awesome gore. There are new traps this time; Acid, wires, a flesh-eating virus, sonic weapon, freezing ice and of course, a room that vaporizes the victim. Now then, the characters are very interesting. For once, you can care for the characters now. You can even feel sad for the victims that are about to die. The main character, Eric Wynn, is awesome. Of course, he's not one of the participants, but rather one of the people who watches the Cube. He has no choice, but to rescue one of the participants of the Cube. Now I heard the character Jax was supposed to be a comedy relief. To me, he was more of a psychopath than a comedy relief, but he did had some funny moments. The direction from first-timer Ernie Barbarash (who wrote and produced Cube 2) got the tone just right. He went back to what worked in the first one and add the old, dark rusty rooms (Hey, I thought the rooms in Cube 2 was alright, but did they think that it would beat the rooms in the original?). Another thing is that instead of CGI gore, the make-up for gore effects is back. I'm glad he went back to the make-up basics instead of crappy CGI. His story was cool as well. As you can see, Ernie is the writer here. No one else, but him. I love the way he explained the Cube mythology. He should make more movies in the future because this film proved that he is a good filmmaker. Overall, I had a great time watching this. It was a fantastic effort to the Cube mythology and I hope to see more in the future. But also, I can't wait til they explain about the building of the Cube."
dvd,,5.0,Schindler's List,If you've never seen this film - you MUST!  Exquisite and disturbing...a MUST for any movie library!  Liam Neeson is MARVELOUS in the title role and Ben Kingsley and the rest of the cast are haunting. Also a fascinating history lesson for us all
dvd,,5.0,One of the Best Movies Ever,"I absolutely love this movie!  It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over.  It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"""The Saw is Family""","The aspects which made the original ""Massacre"" so incredible included the relenting suspense, dark humor and the terribly frieghtening and unusual atmosphere. That was 1974. Here comes the sequel, the mid 1980's, and fans are in a daze at how different it is. I love it. I must say, my original thoughts when i first viewed this film were not good. i found it offensive, gory and way too different from the original. Then i watched it again with a new perspective and fell in love. This film is meant to be looked at differently. This sequel is supposed to be a parody of the 80's teen flicks/a horror film/and a slapstick humored hillbilly flick. I know it's confusing and seems awful when u read this description, but it is a very fun movie. It's not high in scares, but it is a truly fun, entertaining and wild sequel that takes the series to an unexpected level of insanity and action"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Bogie and the original Dead End Kids,"Dead End was a Broadway phenomenon not only because of its subject matter but because of the casting.  For the tenement kids, the producers went out into the tenements to find their actors.  These kids were brought to the screen intact and after a number of other films the dead end kids were born."

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,"Play It Again, Sam","If you don't like Woody Allen, then you won't like this film...Enough said. This is a prime Woody Allen movie; It's written and stars Allen, but is not under his direction. It's a few years before he'd win some Oscars for Annie Hall and it's his first collaboration with Diane Keaton (Who looks gorgeous in the film). ""Play It Again, Sam"" (which I just remembered refers to a line Humphrey Bogart is frequently quoted as saying to his piano player Sam in Casablanca, although he never does) is simultaneously a romantic comedy in the vein of Annie Hall and a homage to Casablanca. The movie stars Allen as Allan, a neurotic movie buff who's wife has just divorced him. She left him because of a lack of excitement in her life and Allan's already low self-esteem reaches a new low. His friends Dick and Linda (Tony Roberts and Keaton) attempt to help him through the process by setting him up on a series of unsuccessful dates. Meanwhile, Humphrey Bogart appears to him and offers him advice on how to score some dames. The guy who plays Bogart, Jerry Lacy, seems to be doing an impersonation of Bogart but upon closer look...He's not. He's merely catching the essence of the man, while making the character exactly what it is...A character. This is a typical Allen romantic-comedy. It's funny, witty, has great one-liners, you don't really buy his romance with Keaton but you kinda do...Out of the 4 other Allen films I've seen (Annie Hall, Match Point, Sweet and Lowdown, Mighty Aphrodite); This is not the best. But it is an interesting and sometimes funny film. If you liked Annie Hall then you might want to check this movie out. It's quite good."
dvd,,5.0,Movie Legend,"I found the prices, speed of delivery, and condition of my purchase to be very good. I had seen this movie as a teenager and remembered the awesome fx. After watching it now I still think the fx were excellent! A good story of ""good and evil"""

dvd,,5.0,Everyone knows someone just like her ....,"Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in ""Laura"" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances"
dvd,11 of 13,1.0,Stargate 2012 - The review,"I started to watch this DVD and turned it off, it is basically a videoed presentation taken at a convention. It has nothing to do with Stargate the movie or TV series which was very disappointing. It appears to be a technical explanation of blackholes, ancient earth legends and the like.  While the subject matter is interesting I found the presentation to be very long, drawn out and boring.  The title is very misleading and I will repeat it so that's it's very clear this has NOTHING to do with the Stargate series."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"A lot of work, and a lot of fun","I am not the most coordinated person and the first two times I tried this DVD it made me so frustrated all I could do was cry.  It was hard to see what she was doing with my back to the TV! But when I realized that I didn't have to get it all 100% of the time as long as I kept moving and picked up where I could I was fine.  I can now do all but the last piece, and that's more because I am just too tired after 45 minutes to keep going.  But I love it!  I watched each section first and then tried it, that worked pretty well.  Once I had an idea of what she was doing her verbal cues made it so I didn't have to look at the TV.  Very good cuing. I think I am going to order the other one! "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Ignore the awful picture on the cover!,"I admit I saw this because of Viggo, but it sat on my ""to be watched"" pile for nearly a year because of that awful cover.  This is a very good movie.  Not perfect by any means, and not necessarily original (comparisons have been made to Donnie Brascoe) but very good.  I thought the relationship between Viggo and the Yakuza boss was wonderfully developed.  On the other hand, I thought the romantic subplot was silly -- also thankfully short, TRULY a subplot, and it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film.  "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Watch but not rip it off,"I see lots of complaints here essintially amounting to: ""Superb danncing, but I cannot rip it off for my dance"". I have heard the very same complaints about tapes from all kind of dance competitions. I have already seen several copycats of some numbers of the show, and I am pretty sure that we shall not see another video of this kind any time soon, because I am sure that the dancers are aware of rip-offs. This kind of dancing choreography takes infinitely more sweat, blood and brains than what you see in an average Las Vegas casino, and can believe what a pain it be to see it stolen and bastardized. "

dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Don't wait to buy it..,"If you are a fan of the Little Rascals, you need to get this one (vol.3-4) and volumes 1 and 2.  They are hillarious, and my children love them.  Just keep in mind that these movies were filmed during a time when there wasn't a political/social correctness filter in Hollywood.  Which is one of the reasons why I like these movies.  I will be sure to purchase every volume this company makes"
dvd,8 of 12,4.0,Chaplin's Idiosyncrasies Captured in Two Wildly Diverse Semi-Classics,"Combining two of Charlie Chaplin's more inconspicuous features into one DVD package really attests to the fact that neither 1923's ""A Woman of Paris"" nor 1957's ""A King in New York"" rank with his classics, but each provides certain pleasures that only a master filmmaker of Chaplin's status could create. Neither touches upon his Little Tramp character, which actually makes his artistic achievements in each film easier to discern. For Chaplin aficionados, viewing is a must. For others, realize that these two films represent marginally lesser work from this genius when one thinks of masterpieces like ""City Lights"" and ""The Gold Rush""."
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,FYI,"Porco Rosso is by far my favorite Miyazaki film due to its witty humor and the anti-war theme.  Althrough kids might not fully understand the movie, none of the content is actually ""mature"" enough that a whole family cannot enjoy this movie together."
dvd,22 of 24,1.0,Don't Listen To A Thing Fed Up Said...,"Egglplant was right when he wrote his review, society does have a long way to go. Why is this even close to 3 stars? Why is Britney, after near a decade of making everyone look like an idiot continue to do so? "

dvd,0 of 22,2.0,So So,"His Girl Friday is an OK movie about newspaper reporters in the early part of the 20th century.  I think it was supposed to be funny, and it may have been at the time, but most of the dialog was lost on me"
dvd,5 of 27,5.0,Maria Theisen is a Norwegian princess,"The story was nice, not spectacular, but because of the pretty Norske girl,  I give this movie a 5 star rating.  Scandinavian films with Scandinavian heroines are the best"
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW!,    This is not as bad as some people say it is. Yes I do agree that some of it might be stupid and cheesy and Jim Carrey is only in there for 15 minutes in it. But it is still good because of those 15 minutes of the film. I am a die hard Jim Carrey fan and this is definetly a Jim Carrey classic. He does lots and lots of things and imitations from his act and did it in this movie. I just dont understand why the picture is so bad it was only 1980! It looks like a movie from the 40's!. Another thing htat I do not like is all the singing its pretty stupis. But anyway not hilarious but overall a good movie
dvd,6 of 7,1.0,Horrid,Get together with some friends and as many bottles of wine.  That way you can possibly have some enjoyment with this inexplicable and boring movie. *special award* for expressionless characters.  *special award* for interminable shots

dvd,,5.0,First Time Anime Fan,"I just started watching Escaflowne because a friend really wanted me to see it and I watched all 26 episodes and enjoyed every last one.  it has it all, and they make you wonder about life and love too.  Its like real life, but animated, very, very good.  I would like to see more anime just because of Escaflowne.  I am hooked"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,"Great cast, great story, great movie.","Matthew, Morgan and Denzel weren't quite household names when this movie was made, but after watching it, you can see why they later became great stars. A dramatic and jarring look at what the Civil War cost this country, in blood and long-seated resentment and hostility, some of which we still see today. The story gives glimpses into the psychology and politics behind the conflict and the greatness that still managed to win the day, even though there was much tragedy. An excellent edition to your library"
dvd,,4.0,Elmo learns to share,"I purchased this movie for my just-turned 2 year old son, who's an Elmo fanatic.  He asks to watch it almost every day.  I really like the fact that it teaches toddlers that it is mean not to share.  Bert and Ernie interrupt now and then to alleviate the scary parts, and I have had no problems with the video being too much for my son.  He does have to watch it with his blankie, though"
dvd,3 of 15,1.0,One Word - Depressing!!!!!!!!,"This movie I think was just plain depressing! Just when you think something good and happy will happen, someone dies, people seperate, bones are broken, so on and so forth. This movie got alot of great reviews, and it was a fun movie, but for people who like complete happy endings, this film is not for you."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Full Box of Kleenex Movie!,"A brilliant, but sad movie about the effects of AIDS, both to the patient, and to the family and friends.  Eric Roberts, Gregory Harrison, and the rest of the all-star cast were phenomenal.  For those who have lost loved ones and friends to this horrific disease, you will definitely be moved to the point of tears, then laughter, then tears again.  I thought this was definitely Oscar material.  It is right up there with ""Philadelphia"" in my book"

dvd,,5.0,Must have for parents!,"My kid likes to watch movies a lot. I've seen almost all of the Baby Einstein movies, tons of Elmo's world... you name it and we've seen it too much. Most of these movies teach and entertain our children, but few keep us adults in the mix. However, when this DVD goes in I actually find myself singing along and enjoying it more then I ever expected. Laurie's voice is phenomenal, and the songs are all very catchy with light hearted themes. The harmonies show that this could be an everyday rock/pop band if they were to go that path. My daughter sings the songs and dances (which keeps her active instead of just sitting around like a lump in front of the TV). She loves this DVD from beginning to end, and she isn't alone. The only bad part about these songs is that they are so catchy I have them in my head when I am trying to get stuff done at work! ""Under a shady tree, you and me..."" hahaha"
dvd,,5.0,Strange yet believable,"Yes, this movie is strange, but considering events that I experienced in my youth, it is believable."
dvd,29 of 29,5.0,Great for Any high school civivs teacher,"This is an excellent synopsis of the uniqueness, magnitude and importance of the U.S. Constitution.  Taking the viewer through each Article and Amendment, these videos clearly and easily explain why the Framers found it  important to separate and limit the powers of government and what each  branch of government is responsible for providing to the American people.   The controversy over state versus federal rights and individual protection  from the government is also well presented.        Filled with great  pictures and footage, the Constitution and its amendments are outlined with  the added comments of two articulate and insightful professors.  The videos  are easy to follow and lend themselves well to student note-taking.  These  are a definite asset to any government teacher's video library"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,It's about time.,"I thought this was a great season.  I got a little tired of the rift between Emily/Richard and Lorelai relationship.  BUT I loved the new Logan/Rory relationship.  It was a refreshing change to see some new characters as well as all of the old favorites.  I was getting tired of seeing Rory with guys who just drained her and did not challenge her.  I do not feel that Logan would be a good match forever, but it is nice to see her stepping out of her comfort zone and having to work for something as well as have fun in college, which I think is a better portrayal of college life.  This is definately a series that I will be sad to see end when it finally does.  There is none other like it"
dvd,16 of 18,5.0,Frankenstein 75th Anniversary is an upgrade.,"After disappointingly releasing James Whale's 1931 classic Frankenstein in two previous DVD editions, I had my doubts as to whether or not this edition would be any better. Would Universal give this classic horror film the treatment it deserved? To be honest, the previous DVD's special features were always great, like documentaries, audio commentary, ect.; but the one real issue that bothered me about the other editions was picture and audio quality. I can honestly say that, even after going as far as making a side by side comparison between the first release and this new edition, this new anniversary edition is the one to own. Much has been improved over the old versions, and I could not see any blemishes that exist here that did not exist before. The film now looks sharper, with significantly less dirt and dust, and the contrast of the expressionist photography has also been improved, with truer blacks and more subtle grays giving the film's cinematography the dark starkness it was intended to have, I dare say the film probably hasn't looked this good in years. And as a plus, they let the end credits fade to black like they were intended to, unlike in previous DVD editions when they strangely paused the end credits. As far as audio is concerned, it is good and loud, somewhat hissy, but not distractingly so. Extra special features also worth while. This new edition finally fives this classic the digital treatment it deserves and proves that even after 75 years, Frankenstein is still a fascinating landmark in early American horror cinema"
dvd,,5.0,Don't Make Movies This Good Anymore,"Very few movies, especially in black and white, can grab your attention from the beginning and hold it throughout the entire show.  This movie does!  The acting by the young Robert Blake has Oscar written all over it, and one of the hardest scenes to watch is when the trigger is pulled killing all of these innocent victims, that just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The movie was very well laid out.  First, you are introduced to the main characters who carried out the crime and then after the crime has been committed the movie covers the trial.  A very clever, thought out movie that you absolutely must see. "
dvd,4 of 7,4.0,Wish it was in Widescreen,I thought this would be in the Widescreen format.. this is pan and scan. I guess its ok since I grew up with that version on tv but it would be nice to see it in the proportion that the theaters had it in
dvd,10 of 11,4.0,Better than STREET FIGHTER and DERAILED combined!,I like this new mature Van Damme.  First IN HELL and now WAKE OF DEATH they're the best films of his career and he's actually starting to show some genuine acting talent.  I hope this trend continues.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Bloody good!,"Really captures the grit, violence, sex and intrigue of ancient Rome. I also love that it featured characters of many social levels - usually we only see the lives of wealthy Romans."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Keep your mind open,"I personally love this movie but still give it a 4 since I know my taste in movies cater more to these kinds, as a result I think I tend to overlook some of the shortcomings possibly. "
dvd,5 of 7,4.0,Urban Revenge Western,"Evelyn Mercer served as a foster parent for years.  During that time, she only found four children she couldn't place with adoptive parents.  Bobby, Angel, Jerimiah, and Jackie Mercer all lived with Evelyn in her house till they were grown, and she saved them from much harder lives than they would have had.  Bobby is still a hardhead and a fighter.  Angel pulled a stint in the military, but remains a man of violence.  Jerimiah became an upstanding businessman and overextended his grasp.  Jackie was pure rock and roll.  One November night, Evelyn was gunned down in a convenience store.  Her sons come back to Detroit for her funeral and stay for revenge, having to stay one step ahead of the police to get the job done.  While fighting the bad guys, they also have to fight each other and find a way to pull together."
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,Misleading Review,"One of the reviewers mentions that this movie has an additional 15 minutes which were cut from the US version. This is not true, none of those scenes is present. I just bought and watched this version."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"""Sea Oddity"" worked for me",I actually enjoyed this much more than I expected to.
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Mark is great,"Overall I thouroughly enjoyed Mark Dacascos performance. I thought he shows that he is more than just a &quot;karate&quot; guy. Though he plays a deep role on the series &quot;The Crow: STH&quot;, this role is way deeper  and alot more complex. I was brought down by the movies overall bleak feel,  but its about a young man trying to get back on the right track, but his  old associations seem to keep getting him in trouble. If your a Mark  Dacascos fan, a must see"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Coloumbo Season 4,"Another fun packed set of adventures with Lt Columbo - what is his first name anyway? -and in keeping with tradition, he solves the crimes even on board a luxury liner.  If you enjoy murder mysteries, Columbo Season 4 is the one for you. Filmed in the 1970s it retains a special charm all of its own and deserves to be called a Classic.  If you like luxury old cars - this series has an amazing range of classic cars the like of which you don't see in today's modern television. Highly recommended along with Seasons 1-3"
dvd,2 of 7,4.0,The Good and the Bad,This movie exemplifies what was good and what was bad about Hollywood in the 1930's.  The good part was that they could take a major work of contemporary literature and convert it into a major motion picture.  The good was that they could create special effects like the swarm of locusts attacking the fields.  The good was that they could adhere to a code of standards that enabled them to suggest sexuality without showing it.  The good was that they could make a moral statement without hitting us over the head with it.
dvd,6 of 26,2.0,bad Hamburger,"This movie gets 2 stars and not 1, only because the story is historically accurate. However, The acting, the photograpy and even the sound quality of this movie are all less than impressive. "

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Enjoyment of this odd movie is about capturing the details,"I didn't fully appreciate The Life Aquatic until I watched the extras (on disc 2). Then each viewing became increasingly pleasurable, as the little details fulfilled their role in making a movie into an experience. There is a story behind the individualized red hats, the life size profile of the ship, the use of actual sound crew as cast, the Portuguese renditions of David Bowie songs, and so much more."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Hitchcock's Combo Platter: Style, Suspense and Comedy","This is Hitch's least ""heady"" film -- the sheer physical beauty of Grace Kelly in her prime, Cary Grant in his, and the French Mediterranean in its, they all conspire to confound intellectualization. The screen seems slick with the vapors of the stars' physical luminosity."

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Allegorical Haiku,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring is a simply beautiful movie, such as those that come out once every few years. It somehow unites different arts such as poetry, painting, dance, muscic that give it a superior aestetic value. For this reason alone it's worth seeing. But at the same time it chalanges our mind with an parable on the four stages of life (in the West we think they are three childhood, maturity and old age, but Buddhists probably divide it in another way) and redemption through suffering. Overlayered on the story there are also numerous allegories some of which are easily understood, and others that are more difficult to comprehend because of cultural reasons (an Eastener will catch the meaning of the animal symbolism right away, while it took me a while). "
dvd,4 of 5,1.0,Misleading,I thought this video was a Cesar Milan Dog Whisperer video.  I was linked to it by the Amazon suggestions on the Cesar Milan book page.  Very disappointing
dvd,,1.0,Great Movie - HORRIBLE DVD,"The move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to DVD that I have seen.

dvd,4 of 8,5.0,"Anton is crazy, and the music industry is delusional","Dig is a very entertaining and enlightening documentary about two pretty poor music groups.  Both the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre lack any real depth or musical value.  The two things that are most interesting about the documentary are: 1.  The totally crazy Anton.  He alone makes the video worth buying.  He lives in his own world, populated with his own illusions of stardom and notoriety.  ; and 2.  A portrayal of the clueless record industry.  From this video you get an idea of why music that is put out by record companys sucks so much.  They employ people who are only interested in money and/or think they actually know something about music and have never played an instrument in their life.  No wonder about 98% of records fail.  Music is controlled by and large by people who nothing about music."
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Be Cool is entertaining but not memorable.,"Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments."
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,"The theme of Transcendence is important--not the ""factual debates about Rubin Carter .""","I was very touched by this movie.  It was not the actual story/plot, or it's accuracy that was important to me.  Rather, what was meaningful about this film was the portrayal of a personal Transcendence the main character brings about in his life--from rage, hate, and bitterness, to self caring, willingness to learning, inner directedness, to a sense of spirituality and something ""bigger than himself,"" to forgiveness and ""letting go,"" and then the untimate Transcendence--reaching out, risking trusting others with his core pain, and risking loving others.  Also, this film portrays some very rare people who demonstrate commitment to their principles, determination to care about ""the individual"" and to rectifying an injustice.  I do not know whether or not Rubin Carter murdered those people.  From my stand point, this is a movie that models personal healing.  It is touching and inspirational--even if it were to turn out to be total fiction"
dvd,,5.0,A breathtaking epic,"Remaking a classic can be a thankless undertaking, but Peter Jackson has crafted a film that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original. Although he rarely mentions other films in KONG history, Jackson has taken elements not only from the 1933 original, but also the DeLaurentiis remake, SON OF KONG, and even KING KONG ESCAPES to forge an epic film about a giant ape and the woman he loves. It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well. Of course this also brings the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic. Many uninformed critics have labelled this movie ""Jurrassic Kong,"" but clearly they are not familiar with the amout of dinosaurs that populate the original film. Now the expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences and they are a real treat, particularly the ""Log Raft"" sequence. This new edition is well worth the time and expense, and the Kong mini-statue is a cool bonus - GET IT NOW"
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,Nickelodeon's Greatest Epic Cartoon Series,"Nickelodeon for sure has completely revived their franchise for world wide cartoons with their latest number one hit, Avatar the Last Airbender."
dvd,,5.0,The Pinnacle of Network Comedy,"Seinfeld is network television comedy at its best. 10 years later as I watch these episodes, despite seeing them countless times on syndication, I laugh out loud. Each show is original, tightly written, well acted and of course freaking hysterical. Even better they have memory...or in more technical terms a long story arc which intermittently continues themes across episodes and seasons. This adds to the richness of the humor and the fullness of characters, it allows the characters to develop and even though they are frequently reprehensible, we also see ourselves in there behaviors and they become very likable. Most television comedy consists of static episodes with contrived jokes and pratfalls where the only laughing you hear is the laugh track. Not Seinfeld!"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Grew on me ;-),"At first, I didn't like this movie, but after the long break between seeing it at the movies and then on dvd, I got to really love it.  I also never used to like Matthew but this is where I fell in love with him. "
dvd,,4.0,A horror film that stands the test of time!,"Simply put, most horror films don't age well at all. When I use the term ""horror"" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which ""the changeling"" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time."

McNamara."" The film's up-close and personal approach to its subject offers an interesting and chilling look at America's foreign policy during the years 1961-1968 when McNamara served as the Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson. The film also traces McNamara's pre-Washington, WWII career as an officer in the Army Air Force's Office of Statistical Control. Here he analyzed and improved the efficiency of U.S. bombing missions.

Wow!,"There is alot to say about this fine movie (my thanks to the director, Martin Brest for slowing things down ), but I'll focus on the big impact for me - Claire Forlani and her complete, breathtaking beauty. Claire Forlani in her evening gown at the end of the movie is one of the most powerful images of femininity I can recall - the way she looks, the way she moves, her control, lack of control, and the things she says, are all stunning to behold.

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,"No Soldiers, No War","This is a great movie that won Best Picture in 1987 and was acclaimed by both the public and the critic. Oliver Stone directs his first movie about Vietnam (the second was ""Born on the Fourth of July"", another great movie) telling his own experience about going to war. From the very beginning we can see everything about the military that they don't show when they recruiting (the ugly and painful true about the war). And the movie goes on an on until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts, doing drugs, killing randomly, even killing each other. This is waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. The movie is obviously rated R for violence, and there are some very tough scenes that make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill -among others- a mentally retarded (and of course harmless) young guy, and a woman. Then they set the village on fire, rape some women, and get away with it. The whole cast is excellent, specially Dafoe, who in my opinion nails his character. And the DVD comes with an excellent and terrific documentary called ""Tour of the Inferno"" (about 30 minutes long) about the film with Stone, Dafoe, Depp, etc. talking about the movie. There is also a commentary by Stone and a captain in there."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Worth it for the commentary track but first buy the Divimax edition.,"After reading the reviews of the various editions carefully -- thank you to those who make that worthwhile -- I bought the Divimax edition first for superior image, sound and range of special features (and they are wonderful).  Then I came back and bought this the Criterion edition (used and at reduced price) just for the exclusive commentary track by director Terry Gilliam.  It was worth it.  If you are a real fan, I recommend owning both versions of this his great children's (nod nod wink wink) fantasy classic."

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,The temperature is rising.,"Kathleen Turner was never hotter as when she burned up the screen in this film.  Experience a wonderful throw back to the heyday of classic film noir.  Watch the perfect murder plot being executed and then it all goes awry.  Agreat revision and updating of the tale of Double Indemnity.  A really fine cast acting out a superb script make for true entertainment.  William Hurt and Kathleen Turner will make the temperature go up, so turn down the thermostat and pop up a big tub of corn because you will not want to be interrupted"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,GOOD  FUN.....BUT......,"Warner's was headed in the right direction with this collection of classic horror, but somehow ""The Return of Dr.X"" was considered a ""classic"" when it's not. The only thing to really recommend this low budget thriller was the early film appearance of a young Humphrey Bogart as the mad doctor. And it has nothing to do with the included 1932 ""Dr.X"". This pre-code film is a classic although a creaky one. It's filmed in the early two-tone Technicolor and features some wonderfully bizarre sets and a grisly plot line involving mutilation and cannibalism. It also features Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill and a truly wild transformation scene with Preston Foster turning himself into the ""full moon killer"" via ""synthetic flesh"". Unfortunately, there's too much comedy relief and the print is scratched throughout. That's a bummer because the story itself is fun and I could only imagine what a great experience it would be with a good clean print. Still, it's a must see for the positives that I have mentioned. My next favorite is 1935's ""Mad Love"" with the great Peter Lorre as the mad Dr.Gogol menacing Frances Drake and tormenting Colin Clive. It's a beautiful print and worth the wait to have it on DVD. The films come two to a disc with each disc in it's own neat slim keep case with the original poster art on the covers for each film. The other films are fun too with wonderful casts ( Barrymore, Lugosi, Karloff et al.) and look good. All the films have commentaries. My only wishes were a better print of ""Dr.X"" and 1933's ""Island of Lost Souls"" included instead of ""Return of Dr.X"". Now, THAT would have been a classic horror collection. But it's still a worthwhile investment for classic horror lovers.  Enjoy."
dvd,7 of 9,4.0,Donny And Marie ,"The dvd's are nice.  The music sounds great.  It Seems like parts of the show are missing.  I'm guessing they have been edited.  More extras would be nice if more dvd's come out.  When I try to play the slide show, the music stops and starts as the pictures change on both dvd's.  I'm not sure if this is happening to anyone else.  Being able to watch this show again is really ""cool"",  even if watching it back then wasn't cool.  It's a great show.  Some might say it's too sweet, too cute, and corny.  But I say, that's the whole point.  They knew it, we knew it, everyone knows it.  Still, the talent shines through. "
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,A great FICTIONIONAL film..,"This is a film not to be missed.  It is only based on a few true events..and that is all.  Do not go into this movie thinking it is true.  This film has glorified the children and that is good concerning its watchability.  It is heartwrenching and probably could happen in real life.  The film portrayed strength beyond words.  I give it 5 stars.  But remember, it is NOT a true story!  It is only BASED on true facts.  The actual story is too depressing.  Maybe Lifetime could get away with a movie like that"

dvd,0 of 2,5.0,Better then seson 2 but season one is still the best,"A great third season to one of the best comadies ever. It's better then season 2 but not as good as season one. This season delt with more real issue's then the first 2 season's like pregnancies scares, more money problems but most of all it delt with raising 2 teenagers and a kid. The teenagers Bescky and Darlene shine this season and the stories more focus on them which is really good. Jacke is still the greatest charactor in the show and shines in every episode. There are many great episdoes to watch over and over again in season 3 of Roseanne"
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,Magnificent transfer by Criterion,"I am not going to write about the merits of Ran, i.e., it is a given that it is perhaps Kurosawa's finest work. If you bought the previous Masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the Criterion, don't hesitate. The ""Masterworks"" transfer is a travesty compared to the Criterion. The colors just bleed in the Masterworks, whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant. On the Masterworks DVD there is a restoration demo, which I thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the Criterion. Get this DVD if you are a Kurosawa fan; you won't regret it. This is perhaps the finest Criterion DVD that I have purcased, and I own over 40 Criterions"
dvd,2 of 4,4.0,Moments of genius,"This is a good movie, but the final 15 minutes are almost pure genius. the story comes to an emotional head, with some great dialogue, and superb acting, but Tarantino nearly steals the show with his cameo. Ever wondered why Top Gun is the greatest script in the history of Hollywood? If so watch this film"
dvd,,4.0,good fun,A nice relaxing movie that has quite a few laughs and chuckles.  Its not a serious movie and not one of Robin Williams best works.
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,A family film but maybe not for all of them,"Tim Burton is one of those kind of directors where 2 or 3 of his films out of a whole filmography goes into a debate on which one's the best. For Spielberg people say it's E.T or Schindler's List, for Kurosawa it's either Rashomon or Seven Samurai while for Ridley Scott people say it's Alien or Gladiator. You probably even disagreed with me right there, well for Tim Burton it comes down to either Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood. Well certainly this film is quite enjoyable but don't think it's one of those family films for all ages like Grinch Stole Christmas or something. But at a certain age, they'll love it."

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,The Sentinel; a review of,"Frankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President's wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding).  If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV's 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in  this flick too.  I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing.  I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side.  I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors."
dvd,,5.0,A Winner,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's full of Keaton's self discovery. She discovers who she really is, and it's not who she thought. A beautiful, sometimes sick, sometimes dirty, and always needy baby enters her life and changes everything! "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Innocently Stupid,"This movie is hilarious.  Of course, I really like Pauly Shore and have pretty much loved every movie that he has been in.  I like how they (Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin, who has gorgeous eyes, btw) are innocently stupid, totally ruin the experiment (you could see it coming from the second they decided to stop at the ""mall"" and pee, but who cares, it is still funny) and then do their best to rectify the situation.  I guess I like it because I am really into trying to save the planet and it shows that if we all worked together (instead of about 99.7% of the people just trashing it) we might actually have a chance at saving the planet, also it was really fricken funny"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Timeless Animated Classic,"""Cinderella"" is an animated movie from Disney Studios that will be a family favorite to the end of civilization.  The 2-disc special edition DVD actually is an edition worth having.  The picture is sharp and clear and the multitude of extras has enough high spots to justify paying a bit more."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,where is season two?,"a great show that launched the careers of such stars as neve campbell,jennifer love hewitt. hard to believe it's been over for over ten years. a show that touched a broad spectrum of topics ranging form baileys alchoholism and the familys intervention,to teen sex,drug abuse, and a whole lot more if they would just release the rest of the seasons. it had a great run, considering not many gave the show great reviews in the early days. but i was hooked right up until the very end. sadly it seems the cast has fallen off the map, you just dont hear too much about the cast anymore. where is neve? what happened to bailey,charlie is still lost, and what happened to claudia. it would be nice to have a reunion for the cast. this was a show that i looked forward to every week. how time just flies. the price is kinda high. but if you look hard enough you can find it at a reasonable price. i found mine at a cd,dvd record store for about 25 bucks not bad, considering everyone else wants 50 buck.  buy it, it will bring back great memories from that time"

dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Great Restoration of Maltese Falcon...HOWEVER......,"I really enjoyed watching the restored John Huston version of the Maltese Falcon from this set of DVD's, However, the bonus materials are another matter. The volume levels on the bonus materials fluctuate quite a lot. Just when you think you have the right volume for your room on one segment,the next one is far too loud, not only scaring the dog,but resulting in a freshly popped bag of microwave popcorn to be spilled on to your lap and living room floor after you,ve been startled. "
dvd,8 of 12,1.0,"Too fast, too complicated, my daughter was in tears","I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchase this DVD.  It is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all.  You are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly.  Even the ""break down"" section of the DVD is impossible to follow.  VERY Disappointing"
dvd,2 of 13,5.0,Elevating,This is a film that plays with you. The emotions that ran through me were scary and exhilarating. It made me think that my whole personal work history was being a whore.
dvd,5 of 10,5.0,Texas OU Weekend:  The Movie,"     Tobe (Drayton) did it again.  Once again, the Master of Horror has created another horror masterpiece.  By now it should be obvious that this film and the 1st TCM are not the same and they should not be compared to one another.  One of the great aspects of this film is its constant reference to the ""Red River Shootout"", the biggest football game in Texas.  Some of my favorite scenes are the Texas OU Chilli Cookoff, the marching band practicing in the hot sun next to Cut-Rite (the chain saw store) and the partying going on at Lefty's hotel (watch for the cameo of Tobe wearing the Hook'em Horns hat ""classic""."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Truly Reno's finest!,Season two was even better than season 1.  Absolutely hilarious...every episode was as good as or better than the last.  I can watch them over and over again.  Very much worth the purchase.  I only hope season 3 is on the way
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,"""It Never Goes Away""","This is probably one of the most hilarious and satirical black comedies I own. Even though it is from the late eighties, it's a timeless gem, and when I need a good laugh, it's there. Just like New Yorker character yuppie literary genius, Peter says, ""It never goes away"". "
dvd,13 of 14,4.0,"""Mozart Is Thinking of Chairman Mao""","Set against the startling backdrop of China's mountainous regions, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress takes place during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, where the government was intent on reeducating those intellectuals, artists and political dissenters. Filmmaker Dai Sijie has created a dreamy memory of hardship and adversity - part familiar Chinese parable, part familiar French romance - in which love of the radiantly beautiful, remote Chinese landscape outlasts bitterness at the Mao era's blinkered commitment to intellectual ignorance."
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,"Great Book, Great Movie","Usually when you love a book, you hate the movie, especially if the book is a great piece of literature.  But in this case, I can't decide which I liked better.  The casting for this movie was just perfect!  I especially loved that the real-life Lady Chablis played the Lady Chablis in the movie, John Cusak's transgender friend.  John Cusak was great as the author of the story, John Berendt, and Kevin Spacey was just as great as the antiques dealer on trial for murder.  The scenery and homes of Savanah were integral to the book, and they came across beautifully in the movie.  It was just wonderfully done.  It is a very funny movie that is also very deep and beautiful.  You really have to watch this movie.  You also really must read the book, they are both way too good to miss! "
dvd,3 of 11,1.0,You've Got to be Kidding Me,"While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan."
dvd,22 of 23,5.0,a powerful film,This film was shown as mid-day movie on a weekday when I was sick from work. Usually the movies shown in that particular timeslot are incredibly shocking and simply make you want to fall asleep.
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A very good movie ....,"This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great.  The action scenes are particularly terrifying; particularly when the T-Rex breaks through the fence; also, when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen -- too bad I was rooting for the raptors.  But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse-pounding!  "

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Sign Language,"It is easy to see why Jane Wyman, with her limpid eyes and winsome smile, won an Academy Award as a deaf-mute in this adaptation of the play ""Johnny Belinda."" The Academy is known for succumbing to characters with mental or physical afflictions (""The Snake Pit,"" ""Rain Man,"" etc.) When she kneels beside the body of her father (Charles Bickford) and signs The Lord's Prayer, her Oscar was a secret even Price-Waterhouse couldn't keep. The temptation to cynicism, however, is unwise. "
dvd,1 of 5,4.0,Yellow fever setten in.,"Wow that Shu Qi is a stone cold fox and that girl can act. No joke I love this film and this lady is so good I was really starting to get the creeps.

dvd,2 of 4,4.0,"""What's your problem?""","John Carpenter's 80's sci-fi cult classic is a very enlarged middle finger towards Ronald Reagan and Co. as well as the American consumerist culture as a whole, much like what George Romero did with Dawn of the Dead.

I can have the TV on any time around him but he only really pays attention to it when I put on one of these videos.  I tried the Baby Einstein videos and Baby Mozart held his interest for a bit, but nothing like the Brainy Baby series.  I've noticed that at first he loved the Right Brain the most but as he gets older he is becoming more and more interested in the Left Brain Video.  I have also lent them to my friends that have the Einstein videos and some of them have gone out to buy the Brainy Baby series.  I'm on my way now to try some more of the serie"

dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Three stories to horrify you.,"John Carpenter (the master of Halloween [1978]) who plays a coroner tells you a new story.  A woman starts her first night as a gas station cashier.  She is all alone.  One customer she meets is David Naughton (An American Werewolf in London) whose character was born in Haddonfield (Yes, the one in HALLOWEEN) where this story is set. Later a homeless man asks for the key to the bathroom.  But the woman mistakenly forgot the key inside her booth.  More suspense.  Later she finds the homeless man murdered.  More suspense.  There is a killer at the gas station.  She thought she was alone.  But that's not all.  John Carpenter will have two more stories to show you.  The second story stars Stacy keach and Sheena Easton.  Keach is a middle-aged man who is upset that he is going bald, just has thin hair.  He tries everything with no success.  Then he goes to a professional hair company.  The third story stars Mark Hamill and Twiggy"
dvd,1 of 13,1.0,This film really is taking the mickey,"In all honesty, this film is taking the mickey when it comes to the issue of egalitarianism in the armed forces.  This is an issue that is very close to me as I have Asperger's syndrome (a condition on the autistic spectrum) and was rejected by the Army on account of this.  However, I passed my Potential Officers Course yesterday, which is the first examination you have to do in order to gain entry to the Royal Marines.  If an amputee were to try and become a Royal Marine Commando, I would think he was taking the mickey.  This film serves to make a mockery of the issue of equal opportunities"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Great way to isolate the TV to yourself,"If you're tired of watching TV with people who talk during entire episodes pop this DVD collection into your player and enjoy fine comedy in silence. Most people will find it too revolting and odd to want to sit down with you. Make sure you have your unique sense of humor and gag bag in hand. Ms. Blank is truly, truly, truly outrageous"
dvd,1 of 4,4.0,Great classic--Two Views,I enjoy this version the best because not only do you get the version to fit a TV but you also get a widescreen so that you can choose depending on the group that is watching it
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Lost a Star,"Though this is a beautifully shot film, it isn't a perfect picture.  Based on the classic tale/myth, the movie does a good job filling in the blanks from the ancient verse in which it is derived.  The problem I have with the movie is that I felt more compassion for the troll(hairy muscle man) than I did for the hero.  The movie tries to be a drama and an action movie and doesn't quite hit the full mark for either.  Lastly, the accent are all over the board.  I recognized Scottish, Australian, Canadian, possibly British and American.  Not to be negative, the scenery is gorgeous, the actors are good, the costumes are great, and the story is a classic.  Worth seeing, but I would rent it before you decide to buy"

All it is is a bunch of models slapping each other (yeah, I know, it sounds hot, but it isn't), and that is about it.  All the action is staged, and except for one of the beach ""fights"", it is pretty boring.  Not much happens, and beyond the hottie factor, there isn't much going on.

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Allen's Last Masterpiece,"Some of his 90's movies, in particular Husbands & Wives are very good but Allen's creative decline can be traced to the mid 90's at the latest.  The air just went pssssss out of the tire, it seems.  I guess public humilation and being called everything from a pedo to a scumbag will kinda deflate one's ego.  Anyway, Crimes & Misedeamors counts as his last great movie. A perfect blend of comedy and pathos.  The acting is great, the script is smart and sharp and funny.  Gotta see this"
dvd,,5.0,Very good movie,"The first time I watched In Good Company I said to myself, eh not good, not bad, just pretty average. A couple reviews reflect that. But ever since HBO started playing the movie constantly I find myself watching it more and more and enjoying it more and more. The best quality about this film is that it's real. You watch the story progress and you feel like you're watching reality. I never found myself saying, how unrealistic, that could never happen. The character's emotions seem real, the situations seem real. That all points to a well-acted, well-written film. Also, the movie doesn't try too hard. It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, doesn't go out of its way to give you a sappy, predictable ending or stupid scenarios that so many movies end with. Just an interesting plot that flows and moves along with realism in mind instead of Hollywood fantasy"

Just when you think that this is the last time you see Dreyfuss he comes back as great as ever.  However as a spirit to guide a totally different pilot. Richard Dreyfuss then observes his past life with his wife drift away as she falls for the man of whom he is watching over.  However, his wife does not seem to want to let Dreyfuss go away from her.

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,What A Pace!,"This show begins to fly along into the stratosphere this season.  It commences with a wrap to Season One's cliffhanger, but a wrap that is realistically unsatisfying and sets up Frank's descent through the remainder of the season.  The things merely hinted at in Season One come into full fruition here and after a couple of early season 'so-so' episodes, the series moves rapidly into what I consider the most visionary and intelligently entertaining television presentation EVER!  The Wong/Morgan 'humor-sodes' are a needed relief from the overwhelming race towards doom that becomes apparent about halfway through the season.  Kudos this season to the actress playing Lara Means as well, as usual, to Lance Henriksen.  The last two episodes are my favorite two hours of episode TV ever.  if you've been paying attention to the series up to this point, they will floor you--shocking visionary and as timely today as then!  I will not be a spoiler past that.  If you like DARK but intelligent television with a twist, it does not get better than Season Two of Millenium"

dvd,1 of 1,2.0,"Interesting Premise Based on Celebrities' Secret Fantasy, But Still Needs More Thrills and Actions","`Paparazzi,' produced by 20th Century Fox and Mel Gibson's Icon Productions, looks exactly like any celebrity's secret fantasy. But making someone's secret fantasy into a film is not a bad thing at all. What I disliked about `Paparazzi' is not the lack of wit or insight into the `jobs' of paparazzi - oh, that's so easy to guess - but the lack of storytelling skill, or its payoff as entertainment. In other words, the story about the rising Hollywood star Bo Laramie who is badly treated by the paparazzi and his secret payback plans is neither thrilling nor intense as revenge fantasy. "

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Best movie I have ever seen,"This is one of the few movies I can watch again and again and again and still be amazed by the story, acting, costume, and music. The performance of Tony Leung and Maggie Chung is mesmerizing. Their chemistry is electrifying. In the mood for love is a must watch film for all married people. Beware: This is a sad love story."

dvd,1 of 5,5.0,Excellent,"I love the show.  Even though this is the slowest DVD of the set so far, it is an awesome show and I will have every DVD"
dvd,,4.0,Where's the complete season 2?,"X-MEN: EVOLUTION  truly is an excellent coming-of-age superhero series. The choices made regarding who would be reincarnated as teenagers and who would remain as adults generally pay off. I find Cyclops and Jean to be more interesting characters as angst-ridden teens. It would've been intriguing to have had Wolverine as a highschooler, as he would've undoubtedly out-grouched even the sullen Rogue, but never mind. Kurt (Nightcrawler), on the other hand, is a pure hoot; the exuberant fuzzy blue elf is one of my favorites. "
dvd,,4.0,The Evil of Art,"Like being punched in the nose, the pain is so shocking that it leaves you fallen to the ground holding your head in surprise and victimizing you pride. Being dumped in a relationship can hurt a person, in The Shape of Things; Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) plays an evil hearted woman who sculpts a human being into her art thesis. In this sour comedy Evelyn's main title for her thesis is ""Moralists have no place in an art gallery,"" which holds true for the climax for this movie. Adam (Paul Rudd) ironically works in a museum, who innocently discovers Evelyn and from that point Evelyn secretly molds and shapes Adam into societies clich? of what people see in popular magazines. Evelyn uses her skill of sexual seduction, convincing persuasion, and even reframes from using powerful motives such as; you must or you have to. With these artistic persuading skills Adam has changed his style of clothing, his sense of style, he finds him having surgery on his imperfect nose, disregards his friends, and even lives a different way to accommodate Evelyn's wants. Neil LaBute writes edits and directs this move in such a poetic and sophisticated way that he is the modern day parallel to Edgar Allen Poe. Having the climax at the end of the movie makes it slow paced, but with patience this move really is emotionally disgusting. Labute successfully created this movie to show that ""Moralists have no place in an art gallery."" Labute also demonstrates how powerful the combination of women and persuasion has on men, and what extremities men will do to satisfy a women's needs. It is controversial to say that ""Moralists have no place in an art gallery,"" because of history of art. Shakespeare demonstrated tragedy, but tragedy shows us reality, and other poets who talk about happiness, these are things that show us reality and it is the reality of art to show us what is moral and what is not. The Shape of Things is a move about a big question, is there moral in art? This movie successfully challenges the audience to think about that big question. It is also ironic that the characters name are Adam and Evelyn... Creative but sad this move is granted four stars out of five"
dvd,,5.0,A GREAT FILM,"Great acting, great dancing, great storylines ! this is is the quentisential expose about life in the big apple for a restless young italian-american man named tony manero - a character flawlessly portrayed by john travolta - during the beginning of the disco frenzy that utimately swept the nation and changed americas musical climate forever. we see a few storylines going on at once, in this film, yet all are revolving around manero and his zest for disco dancing. that we are treated to the now classic dance segment of travolta ""struting his stuff"" on that iconic, lighted dance floor to the pulsing, new rhythm of a right- out of- the- box bee gees number would be just about the whole sh-bang of this picture except for that fact that - again - it is integrated into the more than a few other story lines that also warrant the viewers attention. add in the un-expected twists that some of those dramas take - and the fantastic conveyance of the atmosphere of that time in new york  - and it is clear that this is a film worthy of critical acclaim ."
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,The &quot;Executive Producer's&quot; Thoughts,"This is a really great prison film that truly shows what really goes on inside those dark prison walls across the US.

Definitely rent, buy and let it sweep you off into the world of action and intrigue..........."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"IF YOU ENJOY BALLROOM DANCING ON PBS OR ""DANCING WITH THE STARS"" THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU! VERY ENTERTAINING! RECOMMENDED!","""Shall We Dance"" is, in my opinion, one of the best romantic comedies in years. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a movie with some good entertainment value. You will particularly enjoy this film if you like to watch Ballroom Dancing competitions on PBS or the program ""Dancing With The Stars"". I also recommend that you watch the original Japanese version of ""Shall We Dance"", which this movie is based on. Both films share similiarities, but it is interesting to watch both versions of ""Shall We Dance"" and make your own comparisons. My favorite of the two is the American version of ""Shall We Dance"", with Richard Gere.  He is a multi-talented actor with a touch of Fred Astaire. And he can really dance!"

dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Best Bresson Movie Not Made By Bresson,"Surprised this picture didn't do better at the box office.  After making the dreadful Hearts and Souls (with Alfre Woodard, trying to out-do GHOST) and Speechless (the romantic comedy which killed the careers of both its stars, Geena Davis and Michael Keaton) director Ron Underwood bounced back with this inventive, lively remake of an earlier 1949 movie."

How can any one who hasn't seen the light comment on anything to do with spiritual truth.  This movie is extraordinarily well done and highly inspirational.  Anyone on anykind of spiritual path should see this.  i have a new found love for the Christian tradition because of this movie"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Brilliant,"I loved this movie, I think its genius.  It has depth, detail, atmosphere, and is hilarious with clean humor (which is kind of refreshing).  A great vehicle for Carvey (and I'm not a huge Carvey fan), I can watch it again  and again"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Fans of the book may be a little disappointed... at first.,"I seem to have a pattern of reading books before seeing the movie, and then being disappointed by the movie. Such was the case with BJD. I thought it was a let down, because I loved the book, and there were a lot of really funny parts left out of the movie. But a while after watching it, I found myself thinking of little funny parts and laughing out loud. And just a little while later I really wanted to watch it again. I found that the second time I watched it I appreciated it a lot more because I didn't have the expectations of the book to compare it to. Now it's one of my favorite movies."
dvd,,5.0,Befire Night Falls,"This story is so fascinating that I couldn't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer, Arenas, to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in Cuba under Castro.  Johnny Depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting Drag Queen"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,freaking hilarious,it's really too bad this show didn't last longer. it's really funny stuff
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Heretical and Heuristic,"""The Great Year"" is a well produced documentary that explores the possible link between ancient cosmogonic myths and modern astronomical observations, using great animations, a riveting narration and a beautiful underscore the whole family will enjoy. There are not very many non-fiction films on the market today that educate the average viewer about the significance of the hardly perceptible daily third movement of our own planet - the slow but gradual change of the orientation of Earth's axis in space. Not every astronomer and astrologer - whether a professional or an amateur - may agree with some of the experts in the film that this movement is caused by the motion of our sun around some unknown partner star. However, the film raises important questions about the mechanics of this celestial phenomenon and brings forth concise arguments that have merit. While the scientific aspect gives the film its heuristic character, it is the revealing message of the film that makes it so compelling. We gradually become aware again of an element in nature that offers mankind the possibility to overcome the negativity and the uncertainty of the world and age we live in.  It will be quite fascinating to see if astronomers are able to detect this nameless companion star of our sun that supposedly influences human consciousness. But must science first confirm that we are connected to something far greater than our intellect and instruments are able to perceive"
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,What's new Pussicat,"Typical of the comedies of the time, the movie centers in two characters and a whole of insane situations that ocurr as they get engaged to marry each other. O'toole's character is the editor of a fashion magazine who has a hard time of giving up his carefree life for one of committment, (that much hasn't changed with new films). He seeks help with a psychoanalyst (Peter Sellers) who specializes in the subject. From there the movie takes flight with some not so unexpected twists resulting in a go-cart police chase through the French countryside. Growing up with it, this movie is one of my favorite comedies. Peter O'toole and Peter Sellers do some extremely funny work in this 60's era movie. The suporting cast includes the introduction of a very funny Woody Allen as well as some notable performances by Romy Schneider, Paula Prentiss and some good 'ol eye candy in Ursula Andress. The dialogue is well written and the balance between physical and situational comedy make this movie a very enjoyable experience, specially for those who grew up in the sixties. Burt Bacarah's music sang by Tom Jones is very nostalgic and reminds me of a time when the depiction of situations still showed certain naivet and, to a certain extent, wholesomeness. Not to say that the subject matter of the movie, (sex), is what you want your kids to see, but this movie takes the content lightly and the humor is not as crude as today's films by a long shot. Is too bad that the makers of the film couldn't capitulate on the craftiness shown here whenever they made their next film (Casino Royale) which was, to say the least, an awfull comedy and a waist of some great talent."

dvd,2 of 7,2.0,Is ''cringe-worthy'' a word?,"I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual ""pap"" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character. "

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Watched in 2 days,This documentary is simply amazing.  I bought it as a gift for my Mom (who is addicted to Court TV) and found that I couldn't stop watching.  It grabs you and takes you along for a ride.  A great inside look at the criminal justice system
dvd,,5.0,A Fun Movie!,"""Wedding Crashers"" starts off slow, I thought it was going to be a disaster of a movie, but I was wrong. By the end, the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch. Yeah, this movie is overhyped a little, but it is still a really good movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are raally great in their roles on this film. It's not a film you have to really think about, it is just a good comedy."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Sopranos first season,"The Sopranos first season is a mob masterpiece that quickly grows on you. Filled with suspense, drama and action, this series leaves you asking questions and eager to watch more. It is told from the point of view of Tony Soprano, at first a high-level capo and then eventually street boss of the DiMeo crime family in New Jersey. Although slow to develop, this show gradually grabs a hold of you as you begin to enter and relate more and more to the world of the Sopranos. The family truly becomes real as a result of in-depth character development and complex issues that they are forced to deal with. The attention to detail in this piece is astounding. Every movement, image and sound is well thought out and utilized to express the intended mood. Although it is mostly a serious drama, comic relief is injected artfully to prevent the loss of attention. The multiple conflicts are complex and inter-related. As the tension begins to pick up towards the end of the season it reaches its addicting peak. The many twists, turns and unpredictable events leaving you gasping for season 2"

dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Great Onscreen Chemistry And Breathtaking  Italian Scenery!,"I was very impressed with the on screen chemistry of Cate  and Giovanni Ribisi in the  movie ""The Gift"" so I was delighted to find them both appearing in this movie. The plot concerns a  justice seeking killing which goes wrong and Mr. Ribisi's character throws away his everyday life as a Police Interpreter to be with Cate's character and then they are on the run from the law. The silences between sentences in this movie speak volumes and Cate gives us an excellent performance in a not so glamourous role and Mr. Ribisi is as close to perfection as an actor can get. This movie is also enhanced by the stunning Italian vistas. Bravo to all for the making of this excellent and most thought provoking film"
dvd,3 of 4,1.0,Completey inconsequential!,"I LOOOOVE the recent batch of French films that have made it ""big"" over here: ""The Taste of Others,"" ""Un Air de Famille"" and ESPECIALLY ""The Dinner Game.""

dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Be Cool is entertaining but not memorable.,"Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments."

I was so enthralled that I acquired Airplane, which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Springing up through the cracks,"""Born into Brothels"" is a breath of fresh air in a sea of squallor. Rather than exploring the darkness that penetrates and poisons a thing bright, an equation slathered up by filmmakers such as Mike Leigh, Todd Solondz, Luis Bunuel, Orson Welles, John Cassavettes, Atom Egoyan, Stanley Kubrick and so forth with gusto, directors Ross Kaufmann and Zana Briski have managed here to celebrate the beauty that survives within degradation. Many doubts, like life, surface during the film, but I can think of no greater testament to hope than the spark of creativity burning in the eyes of these children who live like caged beasts, but refuse to be beaten down. Briski is a photographer who has for years lived with the prostitutes of Calcutta's red light district, a sort of ground zero for moral decay that makes San Francisco's Tenderloin district look like a country club in comparison. Mingling with the brothels' kids, she decides to teach them photography as a form of communication, to see how they view their world. These kids, who are furnished with their own cameras, turn out to have a wealth of creativity and she works to save them from a future living the same destitute lives as their mothers. One girl is beaten by her father and mother on a daily basis. Another girl is never allowed to leave her house, and would likely never have ventured outdoors had it not been for Briski coordinating trips to the zoo and a water park. All the girls do chores from sunup to sundown and are privy to so much verbal and physical abuse that they are resigned to lives in which pain and sadness are as certain as the sun and the moon. But by film's end, you learn that at least a few of these brothel descendants  will be furnished with all the tools to dig their way out"

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Faaaaaaaaaaabulous!,"Troop Beverly Hills is just that...FABULOUS! I have always loved this movie. Perhaps it's because I too have a black belt in shopping. Shelley Long plays Phyllis Neffler, a rich Beverly Hills woman undergoing a divorce from the husband she still loves. At the same time, she joins her daughter's Wildnerness Girls troop as the leader to get more involved in her daughter's life. Little does Phyllis realize that not only will she become a wonderful role model to them, but they all help her get through her problems as well. Phyllis is up against a tyrant of a captain for the Wilderness Girls who is hellbent on stopping Troop Beverly Hills from being a part of the Wilderness Girls for good. But Phyllis finds the niche for these girls to fit into. The whole thing is good, silly late 80's fun. Shelley Long is hilarious. Plus, look for Tori Spelling as one of the Red Feathers. This is a great movie, but I'm not sure that the guys will like it. For me, it's one of my favorites. Enjoy"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Way better than expected,Fast Lane to Vegas is a great!  It's got a plot like Sideways... 2 guys go on a road trip prior to getting married.

I highly recommend this film for those who like this genre
dvd,1 of 3,2.0,How Shawn got his snooze on. For diehard Angela Basset fans only.,Shawn got his snooze on watching How Stella Got her Groove back A great looking Angela Bassett strolling around the beaches of Jamaica in sexy swimwear just wasn't enough to keep me awake during this boring movie adapted from one of the weakest Terry McMillan novels. This movie was so forgettable that I saw it over a month ago and I kept forgetting to write the review for it. 
dvd,4 of 15,2.0,WASTE OF TIME,"I am a big baseball fan, so I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This movie was very slow and it completely lost my attention.

dvd,1 of 11,1.0,"1.5 STARS:  Well, at least it was kinda funny, I guess...in a dark kind of way.","Don't look here for a horror movie my friends because you won't find it.  Oh, ""House"" starts off well enough and the old lady's suicide creates an ominous tone and just when you think it might be a scary movie, it turns into a joke.  What you essentially have in the movie ""House"" is a dark comedy bordering on just downright comedy.  There is pretty much ZERO horror in this flick and when the villain is actually revealed to the audience, you just have to laugh out loud because it is meant to be funny.  If you like dark humor with just a taste of horror then this is really right up your alley...if you want a pure horror movie that will produce genuine scares, forget it because you won't get it with this movie.  Incidentally and yet very sadly, this movie produced a pathetic sequel called ""House II"" that is just plain crass, stupid and mindless humor...it is so bad that I will not even write a review on that garbage"

I say it makes a kickass movie. I'll never forget Arnold yelled ""I'm pregnant! Get me to the doctor!"". "
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,DINOSAUR LONGEVITY AND SCIENTIFIC FACT,"The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Miracle Mets,"This set has the last game of the NLCS with the Astros (game 6, all 16 innings), and all 7 games of the World Series.  I was a tad hesitent to purchase this, as another reviewer helpfully pointed out there is an MLB logo in the upper right corner of the screen that was annoying to him.  As I started watching these games, that logo did annoy me... for about the first half inning.  Then it 'disappeared'.  It's really not bad at all.  And this was in 1986, before the score, inning number, and men on base were on screen the entire time.  So the only time you can see the score of the game is right before and right after innings.  Kind of nice.  Being in my early childhood during 1986, it was fascinating to watch these games.  I was especially struck how young some of the players look.  Very different perspective now.  And I love the Astros home uniforms"

Unfortunately the WI that is in Rylstone has gotten a bit dull.  They seem to only be learning about things such as how many uses there is for broccoli and how to pick the perfect tea towel.  But, this is all due to change.  Annie's husband who is the local arborist suddenly develops leukemia.  Unfortunately the love of friends, family and lots of medicine does not cure him and he passes on.  When sitting with Annie in the ""Relatives Room"" one afternoon Chris comments that if people spend too much time on the couch in the room then they will need to build a wing of the hospital to treat them.  During one of the WI meetings the chair starts to talk about the yearly calendar that is put together as a fund raiser, this year's tropic is sure to inspire lots of shots, as it is Church Steeples of Rylstone.  Later while at a local auto body shop Chris spots the Pirelli Tire calendar and suddenly has a brain storm.  Chris convinces a number of the WI to pose nude, yes nude in their golden years for a fund raising calendar.  Her plan is to buy a new leather couch for the relative's room.  After much hemming and hawing the idea takes root and then the hunt for a photographer begins."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,The First Widow,"Guarding Tess is a pretty good comedy drama that becomes a fair suspense drama by the end.  Nicolas Cage (Matchstick Men) plays a Secret Service agent in charge of guarding an obstinate former first lady, first widow Carlisle, played by Shirley MacLaine (The Sheepman).  Cage wants out of the job to move on to a more important / exciting assignment, but MacLaine bends the ear of the current President to keep him.  Arguments between the two are amusing and interesting as they each maneuver to get their own way.  Cage insists on following rules to the letter to try to irritate her into releasing him - but she always seems to have more power.  The supporting cast includes Edward Albert as Mrs. Carlisle's son, and Austen Pendleton as the driver who's with the first widow .. when ... she ..... disappears....."

Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive.  not quirky or interesting.  they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that.  and did i mention it was boring?  so mind numbingly boring.  there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting.  i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this"

dvd,1 of 2,1.0,Moronic,"The so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic.  It is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor.  A three year old will laugh at anything.  Every turn of the plot is stupid.  This is in the running for the worst movie ever made.  I don't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure.  I hope that Bruce Willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now.  I think he is a very good actor.  It's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in, to get his career going"

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Was justice served?  Is anyone truly innocent? *Spoilers*,"These are the issues that are explored in this film, directed by Alan J. Pakula, adapted from the best selling novel by Scott Turow.  It is the story of chief deputy prosecutor Rozat ""Rusty"" Sabich (Ford) in the fictional Kindle County, whose seemingly normal life is shattered by the murder of a female colleague, Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi).  A colleague with whom he had previously engaged in an affair and whom he had stalked when she had broken off the affair."

Each has a very recognizable and personal style yet they are great, apart as well as together. Very glad to have bought both this title and the sequel, for they really help me put a stressfull day from my mind. Watching for 5 or 10 minutes and my worries are gone, thanks to these guys. A big thumbs up and worth every penny"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Thousand Shades of Gray!!!,"Put the kids to bed and remember to keep this series where they can't get at it.  Now kick back and get ready for the ride of your life!  It's salacious, graphic, almost unbearably human and filled with passion.  These doctors can adequately be described as living and working within the ""thousand shades of gray"" that exist between black and white.  The hypocrisy will drive you mad, the passion for life and career will inspire you, the eroticism will leave you speechless and you can search long and hard to find a boring moment only to discover, it just isn't there.  It will make you think more than twice about having that plastic surgery.  It's a clever, cutting edge series with more than a few twists that is sure to leave you clambering for more.  TV was never like this!"
dvd,,5.0,Delightful!,"Our one year old loves this one, and so do I.  The music is wonderful.

While she is being prim and proper and going by the book, Quaid becomes neck deep in a murder investigation. Quaid turns out to be small potatoes compared to who the killers are. Parts are fairly predictable, but on the whole it's not a bad movie"

I had fun and I was sweating in the warm up.  MaDonna made the dance moves easy and broke it down move by move.  Her repoire with the other dancers kept it ""real"" and it was as if I was part of the gang.  This DVD is definitely a keeper!  Now I'm a gonna get the other one... "

With the obesity rate amongst our children on a rise, Get Fit Kids is making a positive spin on exercise and eating healthy!  This video teaches children that exercise is fun, and eating healthy helps you to have energy!  Each phrase is intergrated into catchy little songs that children and parents enjoy and remember.

dvd,2 of 5,5.0,"Realistic, Yet Hopeless War Story.","Based upon director and writer Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Already had the Basic on VHS and glad I added this DVD,"I was also disappointed that this DVD didn't have chapter selections but it really isn't that hard to scan forward to the PM exercises and rewind for a couple of seconds.  It's still a great workout - the best I've ever tried and sometimes I feel like I've tried them all.  Thankfully I already had a basic knowledge of the original Callanetics from highschool so this was just a condensed version.  A tip for anyone interested: I've learned it is easier for me to follow the DVD for a couple of weeks, write the exercises down, and then do them in my living room while watching whatever I want on TV.  This keeps the cheesy 80s costumes and hairdos from being annoying, keeps me from making excuses for not do the exercises since I can do them anytime, and keeps the lack of DVD features from bothering me since I now use the DVD only occasionally as a refresher.  This DVD may be a bit redundant if you have the basic workout but I like the way the exercises are broken up and believe me after the PM program I am very relaxed and more than ready to go to bed (which is heaven since I am a bit of a night owl/insomniac).  I probably wouldn't recommend this if you are just starting out though, it doesn't seem to be a program for whipping your body into shape so to speak like the basic program; but it is great if you are in okay shape and want to tone up or if you are in good shape and just want something like yoga that you can do every day or other day to keep you in shape and feeling good"

dvd,0 of 2,2.0,Too kid-friendly,"I think the only strong points of ""The Phantom Menace"" is Darth Maul and the lightsaber duals, which I thought were well done, and the visual effects and scenery.  But other than that, ""The Phantom Menace"" was just an unfortunate mistake.  "
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Legend (Ultimate Edition),"Definitely one of the greatest fantasy movies of all time. It is a classic tale of good versus evil filled with goblins, fairies, elves, unicorns and mortals. A young Tom Cruise plays Jack, a forest-dwelling hero in love with the lovely princess Lily (Mia Sara). In an attempt to win his true love's heart, he introduces Lily to the unicorns warning her that she must not touch them, which of course she does (breaking off the unicorn's horn and plunging the world into utterly cold despair). She is then kidnapped by an evil goblin who takes her to his master (the devil himself), As in all good fairytales the hero must rescue the beautiful damsel in distress, in this case to save the world from eternal darkness.

dvd,10 of 11,5.0,"More Harold Lloyd, at last!","This is yet another fine Kino Video production of a deluxe 2-disc edition featuring more silent comedy by one of the era's foremost comedians, Harold Lloyd.  It follows the first excellent Kino Video DVD, ""The Harold Lloyd Collection"" (Vol 1) which features the one-hour ""Grandma's Boy"" and seven shorter comedies.  In this second volume there is even more to enjoy, with six short pre-1920 comedies on the first disc, and four longer films on the second disc from 1920-21 which show Lloyd's quick development in a few short years; each film being different in its own way, and showcasing the versatility and wide range of themes Lloyd offered his audiences.   Although ranked alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, it was Harold Lloyd who attracted the biggest audiences and box office successes in the early 1920s, and it's high time, therefore, that his films are finally seeing the light of day again."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Great Restoration of Maltese Falcon...HOWEVER......,"I really enjoyed watching the restored John Huston version of the Maltese Falcon from this set of DVD's, However, the bonus materials are another matter. The volume levels on the bonus materials fluctuate quite a lot. Just when you think you have the right volume for your room on one segment,the next one is far too loud, not only scaring the dog,but resulting in a freshly popped bag of microwave popcorn to be spilled on to your lap and living room floor after you,ve been startled. "
dvd,9 of 10,4.0,A good idea pretty well executed,"[This is the review I submitted some time ago for an earlier edition of this release. This new 'Special Edition' also has a few nice extras, including a making-of documentary, an alternate ending, and interviews with Van Damme and Lundgren. The interviews are particularly good; Lundgren is sharp and intelligent, and Van Damme's exuberant charm is infectious.]"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Interesting film, well-done considering the budget","I won't say too much cause there's really not much to say about the plot beyond the premise:  A pack of unrelated individuals find themselves inside a complex of interconnected cube-shaped rooms which seem to go on forever.  (And some of them contain traps...)  Needless to say, they must get out, though they have few clues.  If this premise sounds interesting to you, check it out, though you should note that this was made for only like $500,000 so the acting and production values aren't going to be up to major-release standards.  I say this partially because 'Cube' is unusually prominent for a film this cheap, so it draws the attention of the sort of viewer that wouldn't necessarily be used to watching something this low-budget, and thus is unable to make the leaps necessary to get into this.  It is abundantly obvious that many of the negative reviews here come from people in this position.  They certainly aren't required to like 'Cube', but their opinions really aren't of much use to  those who'd be part of the core audience of the film.  "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Stunning!,"Christina Aguilera is a great stage performer! Her voice is astonishing, she's a great dancer & she's very energetic.Unlike most of her pop contempararies, she puts on an overall good quality show. One thing I enjoy most about her concerts are her stage costumes, they are so freakin' cute! This one isn't as good as Stripped: Live in the UK, which I strongly recommend, but it's a great show & her vocal performance is top notch. It's very endearing to see her in her more innocent days & it shows you how far she's come from then to the woman she is today"

My 16 month old is crazy about it.  I wish there had been something like this for my 7 year old when she was younger.  Though she secretly enjoys this too...  ;)  She likes to do the exercises with her sibling. Though the baby is still fairly young, I really think this is helping with her motor skills, .  "
dvd,2 of 6,4.0,Whatever happened to Ariane?,"Anyone know?  By the way this disc is worth picking up just for the commentary by Michael Cimino...I always thought he was semi-reclusive, so it's pretty entertaining to listen to him ramble on in a pretty stream of consciousness kind of way...As for the movie, I'd say it's pretty harsh, and probably politically incorrect, but I still find it damn entertaining, and it's nice to finally have it in widescreen with remastered sound.  It's well worth the price and very underrated.  After  Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, this is my favorite Cimino film, and it's very re-watchable....which I think is essential to owning DVD's"

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Pop culture classic,"One of the greatest teen movies of all times. If you were in high school during the 80s, you've seen it. The movie is real, funny and a timeless classic.   I must admit there is a bit of a lull about 3/4 through, after the abortion, but other than that the movie is perfect.  If you haven't seen it lately, check it out and you'll start to remember high school again like it was yesterday. Need more - check out the book."
dvd,,5.0,"Long on Atmosphere, Short on Action - one of the best Westerns ever made","From the opening credits until the climactic confrontation at the end, this movie has the `feel' of a great Western.  The tale is simple and relatively small in scope.  A small town sheriff (played by John Wayne) and his ragtag groups of deputies and assistants (including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan) must hold a man (Claude Akins) arrested for murder in the town jail until the US Marshal arrives.  Akins' brother, played admirably by John Russell, and his gang of ruffians will stop at nothing to break him out.  Ward Bond, another longtime filmmate of Wayne's, also has a minor role.  Angie Dickinson plays the love interest.  This is a film about atmosphere and the interaction between the characters, not action, and is filled with multiple subplots.  This film has the `feel' of the Old West, perhaps not as it really was, but as it should have been.  The main line of the story progresses slowly, so if you are ADHD and can only keep interested with lots of gunfights and explosions, this film is probably not for you.  Dean Martin's character is a recovering alcoholic and trying to become the man he once was.  Wayne's character, while trying to hold his prisoner, is becoming entangled in a relationship with Angie Dickinson.  It is really the development of these subplots and the relationships between the characters that make this film so memorable.  One of the other reviewers states that this film is easy to watch, and I would agree.  I can watch this movie over and over, and if you like Westerns with atmosphere, I think you will too"
dvd,0 of 4,2.0,Shaggy Dog,"This movie was very disturbing to me,I did'nt like seeing the freaky animals in cages.The frog with the dog head bothered me.I don't  recommend this movie for small  children as they would take it too serious. There were some funny parts and Tim Allen played a very good role. I am an animal lover and I don't like seeing any kind of mistreatment of animals even if it is a movie. Now I know why this movie never came to my local theatre"
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,Fun with Voices,"Mos Def ( I think his name is ) had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie.  I wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already.  If people were trying to kill me I wouldn't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on.  People are coming to kill me, why don't I talk really loud so they can find me.  Was he mentally challenged or what?  I was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of ;)  Enjoy talking like Eddie (Mos Def) for hours after you've seen it to amuse your friends"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Dropping Science!,"Easily one of the best concert films I have ever seen. I remember seeing the B-Boys on this tour, and getting just stoopid while dancing in the crowd.

dvd,,4.0,Silly but tons of fun!,"The only drawback to this show is that they made it a half-hour show. I would give it 5 stars if it was a full hour. With all of the historical references and storylines they really should have made it an hour-long show. Don't expect deep drama and social commentary. Sit back and enjoy lots of silly action and in-your-face slaps at history. Like many good shows, there are a lot of jokes for the kids and a smattering of humor that the adults catch."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Fort Apache -- It exceeds ""The Searchers""","This is the gem of the Wayne/Ford Calvary trilogy, and I am delighted it's finally coming to DVD."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,It's not that bad...,I've been watching the movie constantly on HBO. I think the movie's problem is that it isn't a family movie (a couple of scenes push it out of that genre) and it's too cute to be an adult movie.
dvd,18 of 18,4.0,Great workout for any mommy!,"I initally was not crazy about this video- the production quality is lacking and the pace seemed a little slow for my taste.  But, I decided to give it a try and I am SO glad I did.  I absolutely love this tape.  I do this workout every morning with my 8 month old and he truly enjoys the activity time with his mother.  It took several tries to master engaging him in each activity, but now, we go through it like old pros.  I can see drastcally improved muscle tone and I have experienced significant weight loss. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to get a fantastic workout while bnding with your baby"

I could have just waited and gotten the super mario supershow in its entirty which would have included the zelda animated series.  as far as quality of the cartoon, eh, not so hot, but hey, 80's cartoons were all pretty rough.  still a good buy if you're a die hard nintendo fan.  oh, and there are previews in the begining for heathcliff and punky bruster dvd collections, if your into the whole I love the 80's thing"
dvd,3 of 7,2.0,This is a WEIRD film....,"I now wonder why I purchased this flick, a definitely shadowy tale about the romance and adventures of a petty criminal who only gets meaner as the film goes on, and the spoiled young wife of a middle aged businessman. There really is no one to root for in this film, not Christopher Lambert, whose Fred is a raunchy-looking, sociopathic hothead who loves to pull guns on people the first chance he gets, or any of the other characters, most of them living, (LIVING!) in the bowels of the Paris Metro, (which looks an AWFUL lot like Anysubway, Anywhere!) There's ""The Roller"", a purse-snatcher on roller skates; a black muscleman who suffers insults to his intelligence begrudgingly; the cold and terse Helena, played by Isabel Adjani, who ALSO seems fond of pulling guns on people; numerous inept cops named after American pop culture icons, (""Batman and Robin"", ""Tom & Jerry"", etc.,) the police chief that seems a WEE bit too fond of coffee and a smarmy flower peddler who looks like he walked right out of a Martin Scorcese movie. NONE of these people could be even remotely called ""loveable"", their behavior makes that impossible. The criminals are a little TOO vicious, especially for petty ones, and the police are buffoons."

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Pigs Can Fly!,"I don't know anime, but I know what I like. Or do I? The idea of an animated feature about a pig flying an aeroplane sounded a little silly, but I actually found ""Porco Rosso"" pretty enjoyable."
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,"I generally have all the flexibility of a 2x4, but I can do this!","I like these workouts.  I did all three ten minute stretch workouts and the 30 minute flexibility workout today and was able to complete all of the segments and each of the moves the first time through.  I can't go as deep into some of the stretches as Tamilee does, but I definitely can get into the positions (a great start for me) and with time (hopefully), my muscles will loosen up.  This is a big boost to my morale - to feel like I can stretch.  I have tried some beginner yoga workouts with poses that maybe a contortionist could do, but which were entirely impossible for me, and which left me feeling awkward and uptight, not relaxed.  The background setting for these workouts is very pretty and the music is nice as well.  This is a keeper for me"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,very good dvd,"very good dvd, i enjoyed mick introducing the spots, giving back story, and re-watching some classic matches.  personal favorite is the falls count anywhere match with sting.  as for the douche bag who wrote the comment about mick foley not being a wrestler, that's not what a review is for, moron.  in defense of mick, his wrestling made more sense then others, he worked stiff, and he entertained...and that's what wrestling is supposed to be about"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Awesome. A must have for anime comedy fans,"Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard ""The magnificent world"". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon). "
dvd,,5.0,Score; best 'live' so far...,"This DVD is great from the opening track thru the encore. LaBrie's vocals are the best they've ever been on a live performance. The band is perfection, as always; you never hear an errant chord, a bad key, or a rim shot. The lead solos and battles between Petrucci and Ruddess are spectacular. Never has there been 2 players that compliment each other in song as these two. The orchestra, used on the 2nd half of the show, is a wonderful addition. I know lots of bands have done this, including Kiss, Metallica, Scorpions, and others, but Progressive Rock has a lot of chord changes, tempo changes, etc. versus a half a dozen chord changes that many rock songs require."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"A great, short workout!","I really like the upper body workout.  There are options for using heavy or light weights.  You definitely get a good toning workout for arms, chest and back.  As other reviews indicate, there is not a warm-up, so be ready to warm up before beginning this workout.  A thorough, short workout"
dvd,20 of 20,5.0,Ginger Rogers Excels In Romantic Wartime Christmas Story ,"""I'll Be Seeing You"", is a wonderful companion piece to that other moving wartime story produced by David O. Selznick in 1944, ""Since You Went Away"", and it provided Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton with one of their best vehicles during the mid 1940's. Dismissed nowadays as a sugar coated romance that piles on the sentiment I dont see that as a failing at all and instead it provides a touching human story about two injured individuals finding love at an unexpected time in their lives when things are not going well. Selznick of course will be forever remembered and revered for producing grandiose stories such as ""Gone With The Wind"", however his abilities with smaller scale human dramas about seemingly ordinary people in ordinary situations have I feel never been given enough recognition. ""I'll Be Seeing You"", which was based on Charles Martin's radio play ""Double Furlough"", truly proves my point that his way of approaching smaller scale story telling was just as memorable. Here Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotton play two very average and identifiable people, one a victim of the world war currently engulfing the world, and the second an unfortunate victim of one action that had serious consequences, situations any individual could find themselves in. What a joy it was to discover that this beautiful little film has finally been made available via DVD after being so hard to track down for so long."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Cooper's greatest role but is this is a good story?,"I enjoyed High Noon quite a bit and despite of my desire to do so, I won't go into the details that have been repeated many times over by others who wrote a review on this movie. This movie was Gary Cooper's finest effort and as a man in trouble, he was totally believable and totally real. But I have to take John Wayne's perception on this movie and states that its not as great as the hype made it up to be. Cooper played a sherriff of this town who is awaiting recently released gunmen from prison. They are professional gunsligners and Cooper's character wanted amatuer townsmen to aid him. Professional killers needs professional lawmen to deal with, Cooper is that man and the burden fall on him. His effort to induced untrained townsmen who are not fit to support him into this situation sounds pretty weak and perhaps in the western mode...unmanly. His new wife played by Grace Kelly only further do damage by trying to make a coward out of a man she married. She failed to see that if she secceded, she would have ruin the man she love by making him what he wasn't. But despite of his doubts, fears and lack of support, Cooper's character does his job effectively and with honor. Maybe it is a great western after all."
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Cheap wig for a cheap dame...,"The grand daddy of them all.  If you can get over the (intentionally) cheap wig worn by Barbara Stanwyck, there is no disputing this is one of the best of the Film Noir genre"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Very good movie with excellent performances,"This is a good road movie, I really enjoyed it. What makes this movie good is without a doubt the great acting from its two stars. Susan Sarandon and Stephen Dorff are excellent in their roles as kidnapper and hostage. The movie is also funny at times and very serious at times which I really like. Stephen Dorff is a very good actor and if he keeps doing roles like this one he could very easily follow in the steps of Johnny Depp which is one of my favorite actors. Susan Sarandon is always good and this film is really worth the time again the acting is excellent and is the reason to see this movie"
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,A Guilty Pleasure,"This most fondly remembered film from the 1950's is romantic escapism at its finest and most frivolous. There are no deeper meanings here, just a beautiful and colorful dish of Rome garnished with three equally pleasing romantic stories. An attractive cast and an appropriately romantic score from the great Victor Young make this film based on John H. Secondari's popular novel of the day a rousing success. Sinatra's fine rendition of the Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn title song doesn't hurt a bit either."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,NEWLYWEDS IS JUST A GUILTY PLEASURE TO WATCH!!!!!!,"Newlyweds with Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey is just a wonderful treat for our eyes..... Not only do we get to see the hot Nick,but some of the stuff that Jessica says is so funny..... I'm not a huge fan of Jessica or Nick,but i do have to admit that i loved this show its a guilty pleasure for me to watch....."
dvd,0 of 4,1.0,Are we THAT numb to enjoy such terrible writing?,"This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool"
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Different Strokes...,"I completely understand why some people prefer the first season to the second season, but I have to say that I am a bigger fan of the second season because I am also a fanatic of the third season of Monty Python, as well as a lover of the second season of Upright Citizen's Brigade... that is, I like WEIRD stuff.  The more oddly funny, unsettling, strange, and bizarre, the more I like it.  I think that the first season of KITH is more witty, and perhaps more intelligently done, but the second season makes me bust up more frequently because of the weirdness.  This might be because, as they say, you have decades to write your first ""album"" and only one year to write your second one...therefore, the second or third time round, oddness ensues in attempt to get out material more quickly.  Still, I love this stuff.  So, if strange comedy is what you like, dig in to this."
dvd,10 of 13,4.0,Good,"Interesting piece of the Book of the Dead. In the second part there is an animation of the process of dead...., is that the best they can do with the technology of nowadays? I ask myself. Besides that is quite an enjoyable film. I recommend to read ""The tibetan book of the dead"" by Evans-Wentz, my opinion is that is a best translation that the one from Thurman, or Fremantle. If you are really want to learn about Tibetan Buddhism, especially from the Kargyutpa Lineage read all the books from Evans-Wentz, including: ""The Tibetan book of the great liberation"", ""Tibetan Yoga and Secret Yoga"" and ""The Great Yogi Milarepa""."

dvd,2 of 5,4.0,The War - A Great Vehicle for the Young Elijah Wood,"The War is a species of film released in the early 90's with anti-war, anti-agression themes that require movie-goers to commit to the view that the Vietnam War is a symbol for war's futility. It does this using a metaphor used often before-the loss of innocence; in this case, a child's. What complicates this film's approach is the child is not innocent. Stu Simmons is a struggling kid in poverty's grip fending for himself and family, while his war hero, post-trauma stressed father is trying to find his sanity. Perhaps, the father, Stephen Simmons is the innocent lost and visits it upon his family and, particularly his son. "

This show works great acting w/ creative story lines into each episode.  You won't be disappointed w/ the Roswell.  Get all 3 seasons & enjoy the alien goodness"

dvd,2 of 6,5.0,SOOOOO GOOOOD!!!,Season1 was soo good that I could hardly believe it I watch the whole thing at my friends house and could hardly wait for season 2!! What was really annoying however was that Lana and Clark weren't Getting together though there was chemestry and lots of it! I started watching season 3 and was totally on the edge of my seat and even found myself screaming with fright at some points! What totally made me feel better was that Tom Welling was in the picture most of the time! I really recommend this series but for Older kids because of violence and sometimes innapropriate scenes and Language
dvd,16 of 17,5.0,I wanna boogie!,"Mighty good stuff is to be found here. Big Mama Thornton gives a (typically) charasmatic performance of the original ""Hound Dog"" (yes folks, she recorded it before Elvis). Dr. Isaiah Ross performs as a ""one man band"" on harmonica, guital, AND drums and aside from the novelty, he actually sounds good!"
dvd,5 of 7,4.0,Low Budget Yarn Delivers Fun - A Guilty Pleasure,"As a special edition, it has nothng that most DVDs don't already come with; but the extras are fun.  The one featurette - Guns, Genes, and Fighting Machines, includes shots, still photos and interviews from the actors, director, and writers.  The next extra - A Tale of Two Titans, is an interview with Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren.  This was a little more enjoyable.  I seldom like movie star interviews, but Jean Claude was obviously excited and his energy came through, and Dolph Lundgren was intelligent and sharp."
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,John Huston's directorial debut,"After working as a screenwriter, John Huston was finally allowed to direct a film in 1941 when Warner Brothers chose him to adapt Dashiell Hammett's classic detective novel ""The Maltese Falcon.""  Actually, Warners had already filmed the story before, with rather mixed results.  It is a tribute to Huston's abilities that he was able to produce the definitive film version of the story and establish Humphrey Bogart as a major star."

"
dvd,,4.0,"Season 2 A Pleasure, But It's Stifled.","The first season of lost was genius.  You had an inexplicable plane crash and most importantly an entire manifest of survivors.  The second season, although a wonderful combination of episodes, has lost the originality of the original.  The second season was too preoccupied with withholding the series ""secrets"" to live up to its predecessor.  The is still great, but is tight roping between frustrating its viewers and becoming something special"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Favorite!,"This is one of my favorite Christmas movie's of all time. I was so happy with the deal I got in buying this movie, now my kids can enjoy it as much as I do every year"
dvd,3 of 9,5.0,One of the best documentaries ever made!,"I saw this documentary in the 90's and it opened my eyes. Every human being on this earth should see this documentary and rethink it's role in human history. Noam Chomsky is a model. Humam, but a model"
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,It's must have TV!!!!,Jack Bauer is Batman. Ease up it's only TV fantasy. This show is fun as heck! You wonder what the next thing Jack will pull out of his utility belt (actually he carries an old military pack) This is one of the most entertaining and nail biting shows on TV. Don't miss it. Every conspiracy theorist must have this. It answers all the questions. (Just kidding) Buy it if you want to see a modern super hero
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,Awesome!,"Okay, so it's not Schindler's List, but if you like American Pie or Porky's, this is a funny movie with a lot of laughs"
dvd,,4.0,Cliche'?....Yes....Good Movie?.....Pretty Much,"Okay...so Final Stab is definitely a cliche' film, there is no denying that. But why should it be hounded for being cliche' when nearly all slasher films on the market today are cliched as well? This movie was really a diamond in the rutt. I went in expecting pure garbage, but what I got was a decent horror film that actually made me jump, and did manage to create suspense. The only fault I find with this movie is the ending. The slow-motion scenes are WAY too drawn out, and even after the movie was over, I still wasn't sure who the killer was. I mean, the killer's story made sense until the last minute or so of the film, at which point, the whole thing kind of fell apart. This movie is definitely work renting and maybe worth buying if you're in the mood for old-fashioned, slasher cliche' fun"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Great Movie,"This is a smart, funny movie and some of Michael Douglas's best work in recent history.  Toby McGuare rounds out a great cast.  If your looking for a witty, sharp movie this one is for you. Don't pass it by"

dvd,1 of 3,2.0,"Ahh, the country life","I like to find movies in which current ""stars"" were not yet household names.  I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.  "
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Anyone who takes a liking to The Beats should watch this,"&quot;The Source&quot; is an excellent documentry on 'The Beat Generation'. It was so good I saw it twice in the theaters. The documentry has a wealth of new material as long as familiar classic footage. My personal favorite writer Jack Kerouac came out of the beat generation and it was fantastic to see him and learn more about him. The documentry always explores other key figures like :Ginsberg, Burroghs, Cassidy among others. Three actors recite famous works by Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroghs. Johnny Depp and Dennis Hopper do fair jobs at working with material by Kerouac and Burroghs but Chuck Workman slaughters Ginsberg's poem &quot;Howl&quot;. The only fault about this documentry was the previous and that it had to end. Check &quot;The Source&quot; out"
dvd,,4.0,super julia takes the big easy,"the bad news is: the premise is ludicrous, the government opperatives are idiots and if the cia really hires bad guys like these, we're doomed. the good news is, i have every bad habit known to movie lovers and can still enjoy the fast pace, likeable characters and overall entertainment value of this yarn. sure, cub scout investigators don't trip over the biggest murder conspiracy since hoffa, but hey! it's julia roberts at her sickly sweet best. perversion has it's rewards."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Highly appealing,"For me, this is the best superhero movie yet (including ""Superman(1978),"" ""Spider-Man II"" and ""Batman Begins""). It is true to his origins, develops the characters well and it connects very well on a human level. While there is humor, it is not the corny ""action hero"" humor that plagued so many Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and other superhero movies such as the Batman movies. In fact, the Spider-Man comic books themselves always had a good deal of humor and this movie is consistent with that. Even though Sam Raimi had established himself as a director prior to making the Spider-Man films, he is the perfect choice for this because he understands the character and the nature of this comic so well. So rarely is a superhero movie made by a director who fundamentally understands its subject. In that sense, this movie is a dream come true for fans of this comic. Until ""Batman Begins,"" this was really the first superhero movie to accurately portray its character onscreen. As with the comic books, it makes the violence seem as though it really should hurt, yet our hero is practically unscathed. This seems counterintuitive, yet it makes the movie faithful to its comic hero source and ultimately more realistic. And then there is the love story, which is realistic because Mary Jane dates Harry Osborn, the good looking, wealthy jerk actually unworthy of her. True to life, she dates him for all the wrong reasons and unwisely stays with him despite common sense. She is the unattainable for Peter Parker, the intelligent, thoroughly decent kid who has the misfortune of being penniless and average looking. Once he attains his powers, he knows he will forever endanger those close to him. This turns his ostensible blessing into a curse. Not an enviable position because it affects those closest to him. The movie features excellent graphics and effects, very good acting, a terrific story and script, and just about everything one could want in a movie. The sum total is a film so entertaining and so good, even my wife left the theater proclaiming it her new favorite film. (While her regular viewing entails Bollywood films, her other favorite films include ""Titanic"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."") High praise indeed."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Throne of Blood,"Kurosawa and Noh do Macbeth with so much less language (not that I do not like Shakespeare's poetry) and so much more physical expression, that I doubt that I will not be able to read the play again without imagining Mifune as I read Will. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,great,"someone thought this movie wasn't believable, that I don't understand.  For me 99% of movies are not believable, unless theya re documentaries.  Does that make sense?  Maybe, maybe not...really, curious."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A rebuttal of the New Yorker review,I'm writing this to rebut the negative review from the New Yorker magazine.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Funnier than Otto & George,"Personally, I am a huge fan of ""blue"" humor, and therefore my only qualm about this DVD is that the humor is so ""mainstream"" and not the most adult humor I've ever seen. But with that said, I will admit that this guy is HYSTERICAL, and this show is very much worth owning on DVD. A real laugh-riot"
dvd,,5.0,Tear Jerker,"Excellent movie, if you like drama and shedding a few tears. It had a few funny, light moments in the movie but it is well done. I don't care too much for the actor / actresses in this movie (and don't usually go out to see their movies) but they all did an excellent job"
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,Thoughtful movie of a beautiful book,"I did the whole thing in reverse order, saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw it the first time, it was a lovely portrayal of a family in the upheavals of Russia. I read the original book and was captivated by the theme. The story of an ideal person during the hard times is difficult to capture in a movie. A lot of the reviewers gave the movie a bad rating due to this. However, I do not give too much heed to this as I have enjoyed a number of movies that reviewers trashed. A review happens due to the circumstances of the times etc. This movie has stood the test of times. The book is more detailed about the communism and its impact on the people. It has more layers in the story than shown in the movie. "

dvd,,4.0,NOT FOR THOSE WHO DEMAND HISTORICAL ACCURACY,"The intent of the director was to capture the ATMOSPHERE or ""flavor"" of the Elizabethan court. Intrigue, alliances, deceit, ambitions, trechery and emotions. In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands. On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere.  "
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,A pleasant Miyazaki movie,"A pleasant sojourn through Miyazaki-land.  You have your excellent animation, excellent attention to detail, Prisoner of Zenda type Euro-landscape, lack of beginning, lack of an end, lack of a plot. A very typical Miyazaki movie of this period. Beautiful, but empty. Actually beautiful and empty. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Herskovitz and Zwick bring the drama of divorce to prime time television,"I do not know if I can take another television series created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.  When they came out with ""thirtysomething"" in 1987 it was like watching our lives on TV.  I can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of Michael, Hope and the gang.  Then in 1999 they came back with ""Once and Again,"" and all I can is that I hate to think what would have happened if I was not already where the characters ended up in the third season, because if I was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful.  In fact, I would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs, twist the knife, or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce."
dvd,4 of 5,2.0,Poor Video Quality,"I absolutely love the Avonlea series that was on the Disney Channel.  I was very excited to learn that Disney was releasing the series in a complete season format.  Although the package does not indicate that it is closed captioned it is.  That was a must for me as I am deaf.  Unfortunately, the video quality is very poor and a LOT of editing was done in most of the episodes.  I would consider purchasing from Sullivan Entertainment, but their discs do not have closed captioning or even subtitles.  If you don't mind the editing, poor video quality or the sometimes out of sync audio, then you would like it very much"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Thoughts from your dysfunction,"I really enjoyed this dvd. It had some good music videos and I really enjoyed the bikini bandits portion. The only thing I didnt like was the music video to ""war drums"" I could tell that they really don't like the war. I am currently in Iraq right now, and what I do saves lives, I dont like the fact that they make our service members out to be sheep lead my prez Bush. That video somewhat left me speechless. All in all it is a very good dvd and I highly recomend it"
dvd,,5.0,A touching romance,"I saw this film awhile ago and plan to watch it again because I purchased it.  This is a beautiful romance.  The setting is unique, 1950 Sweden in the country.  It's semtimental but not sappy.  It's not predictable and formularistic"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Excellent,I ordered this movie after finding out it had Amy Jo Johnson in it. I've loved her acting ever since I saw her in Power Rangers and Susie Q so I figured I'd really like this movie as well. I was definitely right on.
dvd,13 of 13,5.0,Mrs. Inflexible,Was very leary of ordering this because piates is totaly new to me. I did not think I would be able to do much if any of the exersizes. But thankfully I was wrong! This was great to get into pilates with! I am very happy with this DVD
dvd,,5.0,One of the Best Movies Ever,"I absolutely love this movie!  It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over.  It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)"
dvd,2 of 5,4.0,I Liked It...Just Not as Much as Everyone Else Does.,"""The Searchers"" is considered by many to be a masterpiece of both the Western genre and of movies in general. It's even on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#96). I liked the film; It's got a lot of good things about it, but one thing I look for in a film to really call it ""Great"" is entertainment. The movie is entertaining, but a movie on that same list that's a few notches below it ('Unforgiven') was a much better movie; Both as a film and as entertainment. Anyway, I've seen over a thousand movies and have somehow never seen a John Wayne film. Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier who shacks up with his brother and his family. After they're all killed and his two nieces are kidnapped, Ethan sets out on an obsessive quest to get them back. One of the nieces is found dead soon after and the rest of the film is about them trying to find the living one Debbie (Natalie Wood). Along with him is Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter), a man Ethan doesn't really like. Ethan hates indians and Martin is 1/8 Comanche. Early in the film, you find out that Ethan actualyl saved Martin when his family was killed by indians and gave him to his brother and his brother's wife. Even though he seems disagreeable, it sounds like Ethan's quest in honorable enough. But, you'd be wrong. He's not out to save Debbie, but to kill her. When people are kidnapped by the indians, they pretty much become one...And Ethan can't have that. The movie takes place over a long time span and there were times that, I thought, the movie seemed longer than it was. The film has beautiful cinematography though, especially when you consider that the film was released in 1956. John Wayne's performance is very good and, you find later, multilayered. Having read about the film a little bit, I found that it inspired movies like Taxi Driver and even the Buddy Holly song"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,New Orleans and the Dust Bowl are the same thing,"It is defined still today as one of the most socialists film to come out from mainstream Hollywood.  Contains scenes of authoritarian brutality and the awakening of proletarian consciousness.  A film like this would be impossible in today's political context, and for sure it will not win Oscars (nowadays some throwaway things like ""Crash"" get the golden uncle).  Despite a populist epilogue added by master producer Zanuk the events depicted in the film remain as the strongest warning against capitalism that I ever seen from an American movie.  Greg Tolland's photography and the sweeping force of the story will blow you away."
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,good not great but well worth owning,i didn't know what to think of this movie at first but after about the thirty minute mark i couldn't stop watching. its got plenty of plot twist and was really a good movie to watch curled up on the couch when you have nothing to do
dvd,,5.0,Something for her to believe in ,"First off, I was pleasantly surprised at Topher Grace's acting skills.  When the movie was just starting I was thinking to myself, 'this looks good, but couldn't they have cast someone other than him?'  Well, I was wrong--he did a great job, maybe ""That 70's Show"" makes everyone seem annoying & no fault of his own."
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,Not Just About the American Revolution,This is very good movie--and it's not just about the American Revolution.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Just amazing,"I have been listening to Sarah Mclachlan for years and this DVD brought to my attention the passion, emotion and meanings behind several of her songs. She has an beautiful voice and very powerful words and this was truly an amazing DVD. I would suggest it to anyone"
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,This just didn't do it for me,"Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Fun-filled musical comedy with many important social issues.,"""Hairspray"" captures early '60s life in Baltimore as Tracy (Ricki Lake) a young and chunky fan of a local dance TV show makes her way to become the star of it. Though she is poked fun at, nothing stops her including winning the heart of another dance regular on the show. The action of the story is centered around her as she also tries to have the dancing show entirely integrated. This movie is a very cheeky one that also adresses some very important social issues like civil rights. Tracy and her friends discard the snobbish attitudes towards minorities and strive for integration for everyone. It's a very cool flick filled with great early '60s rock'n'roll and R&B classics. There is a soundtrack, but sadly not all of the 30-some songs heard in this movie are there. It'd be nice to have all the songs though like ""American Graffiti."" There is an all-star cast including Sonny Bono, who stars as the father of Tracy's rival on the dance floor, rhythm & blues legend Ruth Brown as the town dee-jay, Motormouth Maybelle, and  Divine as Tracy's Mother. All you MPT viewers from Baltimore, look for Rhea Feiken in a cameo role as Tracy's geometry teacher. It's also interesting that once the parents each get a good look at what their kids are into, they become hip like them. You've got to see this movie to know what I mean. Not only is it great for the music, the dancing, the nostalgic feel and the familiar faces, but also because of the righteous message that we learn...as well as doing the ""Madison Time."" Hit it"
dvd,15 of 19,5.0,Herb Meyer and his clarity of thinking,"Any person serious about understanding why the world is as it is today needs to purchase this DVD ""The Siege of Western Civilization."" In fact, you can label this work ""required"" or ""a must see"" if your intention is to know what we are up against, how we got here, and what we can do about it. In a friendly and sincere presentation that reveals uncommon clarity of thought, Herb Meyer lays out the case for why our entire way of life is threatened. The stakes could not be higher. Herb Meyer clearly explains the game. Watch this DVD and you'll be one of the people who ""get it"" regarding what's going on in the world today. Bernard Lewis, the Princeton University historian, comes to mind as one of the foremost authorities on Islam's clash with modernity and its consequences. Add Herb Meyer's name to that list.     "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The Greatest Comic Adaption Ever Made!A Masterpiece!,"This is pretty much the greatest comic book adaption ever made!Batman Begins is an epic!The story is so great!The acting is top-notch!This is as close to the comic book as you can get.Christopher Nolan did a excellent job at actually capturing the myth and personality of Batman on film.Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly,truly like no other before him.All the actors play their parts extremely well,as if they were born for the roles!Batman Begins is an instant classic film,that no doubt will be talked about and remembered for years to come.If you havent bought this movie already,I advise that you add it to your collection!It is truly a must have"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Dance On,"First, let me start off by saying I think the casting choices for this movie were perfect.  I had doubts that the movie would be any good, because I'm not exactly a fan of Jennifer Lopez's acting, but she did a brilliant job playing her part."

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,30 year-old...going on 40,"Perhaps Kurosawa's most darkly comic, ""fun"" movie.  Based very loosely on a 1929 Dashiell Hammett (author of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man) novel entitled, Red Harvest, Yojimbo employs many of the same conventions.  Namely, the nameless protagonist who finds himself in the supremely corrupt town, and, warned to leave, stays on to punish the guilty.  Mainly for his own cynical amusement.  "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A Serious Batman,"Batman Has always been one of my favorite comic heroes. This movie departs from the somewhat whimsical, goofyfied villans of the last few installments and returns to a more serious feel. It explores how Bruce Wayne evolves into Batman from his Ninja like training to his cool gear.His mentor becomes his nemesis in a great finale. This is a really cool movie. I am an amature film maker so the ""making of"" features on the dvd are a real education. My only critique is that some of the fight scenes are shot so in tight that you don't get a good look at the action"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A powerful and moving story.,"I initially wanted to see this movie because I am a huge Oliver Martinez fan and I wanted to see more of his work.  The fact that Oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me.  I was so engrossed from beginning to end with this movie that I hardly noticed Oliver was missing.  Javier Bardem has to be one of the most passionate actors I have ever seen.  I was mesmerized by his protrayal of Reinaldo Arenas.  And while this movie may not be for everyone, I would say it is the best biographical movie I have seen in my lifetime.  As added bonuses, there was Oliver Martinez, for me, of course.  Also, Sean Penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen.  Johnny Depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer.  His facial expressions alone are pure comical genius.  And, while I am a huge Johnny Depp fan,as well, I am glad his parts were minimal as Javier Bardem is the true acting genius in this film.  I am now going to further investigate Reinaldo Arenas and Javier Bardem and see what else they have done that may interest me.  Isn't that the true motivation of a movie or writer....making you want more from them? "
dvd,,4.0,John Leguizamo rules,This is Pricilla: Queen of the Desert set in Texas. But gosh...this movie's just so cute. Attacking this film is like going after a defenseless bunny with a bazooka. No mortal movie sins are committed: the jokes are funny and the actors actually sort of look like women. Sort of.
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,Great period piece sci-fi. ,"I first saw this in the theater way back when.  Sci-fi has come a long way, but this movie is not without it's charms.  Back then it really did seem possible that we could destroy the planet with pollution.  And, there wasn't all that much sci-fi going on back in those days during the big gap between 2001 in the late Sixties and Star Wars in the mid-to-late Seventies.  "

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Nicol Williams saves the day - and the film,"I must have watched this film a few dozen times after seeing it in 1981 in the company of the then U.S. National foil champion and other national squad members.  (My big brag I suppose, but I was an active fencer too).  I watched it enough to spot all the scene bloopers and there were plenty.  In the forest love scene for example, some human like creature is scurrying up the hill at the high right of the screen.  If that was Merlin making a voyeurs gettaway, it is not explained!  The worst setting I ever saw it was in Palo Alto in 1981 when a group of Stanford frats kept laughing at everything they saw and heard.  I guess they thought they were viewing the Monty Python version.  (Which I saw in 1975 and laughed my head off at too).  But I digress."
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,A Fun Movie For Fans,"""Red Eye"" is a throw back to the days of Hitchcock, when movies were more of a mind trip and what would I do in that situation. That is the case here in this film. As I watched this movie, I thought about what I would do if this happened to me. Wes Craven, even though I love his other movies, has proven that he can do other things besides slashers and be amaazing. "
dvd,,5.0,Ignore the people who knock this CLASSICK!,"No this isn't near as good as The Chainsaw Massacre and nothing Tobe Hooper has done has been, BUT just see this to see NEVILLE BRAND! The man was an underrated actor who plays his underplayed role just right!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Rebus on screen,"Loving the character and the writing style, I read every available Rankin Rebus novel-- checking out screenplay was inevitable.  At first expecting to meet the buffoonish brother-in-law co-star from the Mummy, I was delighted to meet Rankin's John Rebus, AKA John Hannah. If you like the Rebus novels, then you'll enjoy these Rebus movies.  One caveat:  if you're new to Rebus, you might wish first to read the novel upon which the screenplay is based, avoiding potential confusion created by the quick pace, Rankin's complex plots, or the Scottish accents.  Enjoy"

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,It doesn't matter what you do or who you are -- you're toast...,"The Grudge is the American remake of the Japanese horror film. What's different about The Grudge is it's non-linear story line. At first you think it's three separate stories, then just two, and finally you realize that your seeing interspersed storylines from the past and from the present and they meet at the end of the film -- filling you in on the curse and what's happening. (Think Momento and Identity)"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,One of the very few movies that actually makes you laugh,"I just watched my new Ice Age DVD and was delighted. Most of us like the film and I am extremely pleased with the transfer to DVD. I have a 35"" TV and an older Yamaha receiver with Dolby Pro-Logic. I set the listening mode to 70mm and was very impressed with how good it sounded. I would guess the Dolby Digital soundtrack is awesome. The video transfer is gorgeous. I have waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD and I'm very happy to have this two-disc edition."
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,A good if not perfect record of the play,"Having seen this show in its original incarnation on Broadway, this production is an excellent reminder of how magically transformative live theater can be.  While the  production lacks some of the punch -- and a few of the details -- and has lost a bit of the scale of the original New York offering, it does capture the essential spirit of the play."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,People who hate this movie watched it for the wrong reasons...,"2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Fun at Full TILT!,Grab your garden hose and a top hat because The air up there is finally on DVD!

Trust Me this movie is genuine

But you'll also have to be happy with the following qualities: Slapstick, stupid, forced humor, poor acting, mediocre dialog. It's obviously low budget. And it just isn't funny, which is bad since it's suppose to be a romatic comedy. Don't buy it. And don't waste your time renting it. Try Mambo Italiano instead"

Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day.  Soundtrac is great with kate bush ""the woman's work"".  My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played.  i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife.  boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever."
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,An Early 90's Must Have,"If you like Kevin Smith, you like Clerks. I realize that every rule has millions of exceptions, but Smiths low budget indie feature from 1994 reveals everything great (and not so great) about this director/writer/actor (if you call Silent Bob acting)."

dvd,2 of 4,5.0,ageless,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I laugh as hard at this in my 40s as I did in my 20s, it's just a hysterically funny flick!"
dvd,11 of 13,1.0,Cheesy and poorly made...,"The first thing you notice is the movie appears to be filmed by a regular camcorder. It does not have a ""movie quality"" look. It looks amatuer. The acting is mediocre to poor, very cheesy lines.  The movie depicts the love affair between two prisoners, one black - one white. As someone mentioned before, the Black American role has a British accent! The movie looks like a gay porn without the graphic sex. Yes, you see allot of bare chested muscular male prisoners -  who simply pose trying to look tough, a graphic masturbation scene and the stereotypical prison gang rape. The whole film looks the director found an empty jail in Germany, hired a few muscular extras and some acting school amatuers as the leads. The movie tries to be homoerotic or a gay soft porn but it is so poorly done, you just want to get to the end (and a unbelievable one at that"
dvd,,5.0,Beyond Magnificent and well beyond all other Superlatives,"Arrested Development has destroyed my carefully cultivated Non-T.V.-Watching. I am now glued to the set for multiple hours a day (much to the bemusement of my husband and close friends). I also now have a freakish and eccentric reputation due to my non-sequeterial quoting of Arrested Development. I have been known to watch all three seasons in one day, and I am slowly bringing all my non-local family members, and friends of friends under the banner of this Amazing Show. The acting couldn't be beat, nor could the storyline be improved upon. The ONLY beef I have with this otherwise-flawless show is the simple fact that NEVER ONCE DID WE SEE BUSTER'S CHICKEN DANCE! This has aggrevated me out of all proportion with reality. Otherwise, (and truenly, even with this annoyance) this series is a MUST watch, and (dare I say it?) a Multi-Watch. Pop some Popcorn, make some Cocoa, grab the covers and prepare to laugh yourself silly!"

dvd,14 of 15,5.0,Just what I was looking for,"I've tried a couple other DVD's and a book and didn't really feel I was getting good use of my exercise ball.  This one was just what I was looking for.  The format of having 3 separate workouts of 10 minute length provides some nice flexibility.  Also, having variations for me as a beginner was nice so that I am not getting frustrated since I can't do the hard stuff yet.   The upper body workout requires some small weights (10 lb. and under works), and since I already had those, it worked out well.  "

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Harrowing,"From the performances to the black and white film to the music, this film is a harrowing and realistic look at the ravages of alcoholism and what it can take to get sober"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,"Great movie, bad DVD release",This is Sigourney's second studio film and it holds up fairly well. However the DVD release is disappointing. There are no close captioning or subtitles and the film transfer is weak. I hope that 20th Century Fox will shell out some money next time for a better DVD edition. This movie deserves better. Great cast and great script. They dont make movies like this anymore....

dvd,,5.0,"Medium, why is it not on tv enough!!","Patricia Arquette really delivers as her character, Alison DuBois."
dvd,3 of 6,2.0,ok but wouldn't watch again,"When I saw the trailer I thought I would enjoy this movie, especially being a big fan of Mr.Cage.  I thought my wife would not like it at all.  Well I was wrong on both counts.  My wife liked it, I didn't really care for it.  Having said that I probably would have given it 3 stars had it not been preachy, even as it was subtle with it's sermon. I was not expecting a social commentary film on the evil that gun merchants do.  I actually expected somewhat of an action movie.  I think most people realize what arms dealers do for a living and the often horrifying consequences of that.  I really don't need a 2 hour movie to educate me on that fact. The characters I thought were pretty weak as well. Picture Woody Allen as an international arms dealer doing business with ruthless war lords that would cut your heart out in a second.  That's obviously an exaggeration, I mean it is Nicholas Cage, but you get the idea.  I'll leave it at that because I don't want to give anything away.  If your looking for something along the line of The Rock, this isn't it.  If you want to see a movie about how disgusting and evil arms dealers are (their not really bad guys they just do really bad things), and how terrible the US Government is for associating with them then you'll really like this movie. "
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Brilliant!,"This DVD contains live footage of the Scissor Sisters in concert at the United Kingdom's [...] capital, Brighton.  It also has the videos of their first few singles, missing only ""Filthy Gorgeous"".  Originally ignored in their home country of the US, the Scissor Sisters were snapped up in the UK, where the British public have really taken them to their hearts, winning many awards at the Brits.  The music is terrific, by turn both strident, relaxed, radical, soulful, poppy and very catchy.  You definitely get the feeling that this band enjoy making music and performing.  Why have the US been slow to catch on?  Ask yourself why didn't ""Brokeback Mountain"" win the Best Picture Oscar, and you will be more than halfway there"
dvd,,5.0,Very rewarding!!!,"Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington.  This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting.  Exciting.  Smart casting and directing.  Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past.  This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride.  Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer.  Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal."
dvd,,5.0,a perfect DVD for Van Morrison,"The Montreux series is a gift for Jazz/Rock fans and Van Morrison' DVD is no exception. Moreover, this series catches most of the artists in their pick or prime time while they were in the best shape. Van Morrison always walks between different types of music and has no real borders- the mixture of streams and trends gives him a unique style. In the 1980 show one can hear a very happy and content Van Morrison who even goes for a jumpy Reggae style version of ""It stoned me"" while the 74' show is slower and in a blue style. In both shows Van Morrison is in its best and, of course it's a celebration for the funs. The quality and sound of the DVD is perfect.  "
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Beware the DVD Soundtrack,"I have to give the dvd version of the Bunker only 4 stars, since someone, for some reason, has changed the movie's soundtrack from the original.

I felt silly doing the dance portion and I really don't care for the music.  Other than that, I recommend this video for toning. I have also tried ""Optimizer"" and ""Strength and Grace"" which are also very good and there is no dancing.  "
dvd,5 of 7,4.0,A Singular Experience--Not A Modern War Epic,"I knew from the start that ""Jarhead"" had the potential to be a polarizing film.  Any time you address a contemporary and controversial political topic--you end up with reviews at both ends of that political spectrum.  In other words, it's generally a love it or hate it proposition.  It's either genius or its crap.  After the film received decidedly mixed reviews upon its release, it's not something I rushed out to see.  However, to my amazement, the film is surprisingly apolitical.  It's a simple tale with a few observations about the nature of modern warfare, but no real message."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Nobody puts baby in the corner to carry a watermelon,"I have one hand on the bible, one hand in the air, and I confess that I indeed used to be obsessed with this movie, as most women my age were. I had the soundtrack, I knew every line, I knew the choreography every dance step and swivel and thrust. Jennifer Grey was me, big nose, bad perm and small chest. Patrick Swayze, well he didn't exist in my world, so I had to watch his again and again. We all knew the ""I carried a watermelon"" and ""nobody puts baby in the corner"" but did we really know why we even felt so passionate about it in the first place? The story being set in the late 50's, the setting at a family vacation spot, the outsider looking in, dancing, forbidden love, mystery, it all entered our psyches as THE perfect movie and never lost its footing. Could Patrick Swayzes white t-shirt be any tighter, could Jennifer Grays smirk be any cuter, could Jerry Orbach be a more perfect protective father?  NO! After this came out, I saw advertisements for learning how to ""dirty dance"" and asked my parents, with me being in ballet and jazz, what was one more class? Well it turns out 14 year olds shouldn't be gyrating against each other, who knew? I still learned them, by watching the tape over and over, but my partner was a girl named April and I think we giggled too much. Now that I think about it, if anyone had caught us I would have been straight to therapy. I haven't watched it in years, my husband refuses to even acknowledge its existence ""chick movie"" he mumbles, is it really just a girl phenomena? Well, no matter, It's a perfect specimen of Fun, laughs, thrills, tears and friction!"

Everytime that I watch this move it makes me want to go back to that night.  Some people don't like this movie but in perspective no one liked the breakfast club when it came out.  This is one of those movies that will live on forever."
dvd,10 of 12,5.0,BEST SEASON!,"Indeed, the fifth season of 24 is the best season thus far... And I thought the fourth season was good.... Boy was I wrong when I saw season 5... Right from the first hour onwards, you will be hooked to find out what is going to happen next... Unpredictability, suspense and great acting. This one had it all.."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Great movie -- wonderful soundtrack,"Great storyline.  The music by Osvaldo Golijov underwrites the drama of the movie.  John Turturro was amazing as one of the lead characters -- the opera singer -- as this is most different from most roles he has played.  Johnny Depp was mysterious, deep, distanced but acknowledges the attraction that Christina Ricci's character has for him.  Cate Blanchett's character richly unfolds as the movie progresses.  Cinematography was very colorful and sets the movie just ""right"""

I mentioned this old generation to her, describing the various characters and she absolutely wanted to see it!  I purchased the first season DVDs of the old generation for her and she ate them up!!  She is now 13 and I have purchased the second Season for her as she started the 8th grade.  Again, she absolutely loves watching the shows!  I find it strange that she would be drawn to these old style shows... the old hair, clothes, styles.... but she loves them as much as I did then.  It just goes to prove what a great show that was and how the lessons never fade"
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,"New Mexico's gift to NYC,","I got my set on August 9 and was delighted with it.  I remember the show from it's origional run back in the early 70's, but I'd forgotten many of the details of the shows that made them fun.  Dennis Weaver is really cool as McCloud, and being from the SW myself, I like seeing a  virtuous western lawman hold his own with NY's finest.  The scenes shot in NYC are fascinating to me as I've never visited.  In one episode the unfinished second tower of the World Trade Center is very visible beside the one that was finished at the time.  I enjoyed seeing the familiar faces of actors I'd seen in other Universal shows, especially a very young Randolph Mantooth, Vince Howard, James McEachin, Raul Julia, Gregory Sierra, just to name a few.  J.D. Cannon was also perfect as the long suffering Chief Clifford.  I also like Terry Carter as McClouds's sometimes reluctant partner, but I loved the wry barbs that Sgt. Thatcher ,(James McEachin) and McCloud exchanged in The Disposal Man episode.  The dvds are sharp and clear, the captioning is nice, I enjoy this type of show so much more than the modern cop shows, I recommend it highly, especially the first two seasons that are in this set"

dvd,8 of 9,5.0,VERY ORIGINAL PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA,"This is a film that is a bit over analyzed. When I first saw the film, I really didn't care about the analytical makeup of the film, but was more intrigued with the story of a very troubled teenager: Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal). With a very original script, and great acting, the film is a bit difficult to label as a genre. So I won't label it. Donnie is living his own reality in this film, and although I have not seen the Director's Cut, nor do I wish to, the original is very good as it is. "
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Blackadder the memories,"They were as good as I remember them the first time, though I did not see all the first time.

dvd,8 of 10,4.0,"Not as good as CSI Vegas, but better than CSI New York :-)","Admittedly, I don't love this as much the original CSI set in Las Vegas, but I don't like CSI New York and don't watch that at all.  I really like this cast (and in the first episode of this season we lose Tim Speedle (who I thought was pretty good in it - maybe a little dull but a nice guy).  That was a sad episode but his replacement Ryan Wolfe (who's so cute) does a good job in filling the void.  He's an ex cop and takes some time fitting in with the team."
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,I don't see how it could be any better than this!,I can't really add anything to the praise that has been heaped upon this series all these years except to say that I (barely) remember seeing it when it originally aired and have seen it in many repeats over the years on different channels and it has NEVER looked nor sounded any better than this

dvd,,5.0,Hard to resist due to good performances...,"I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force. "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"""THE TEXAS GATOR MASSACRE""","now this is the real ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE PART 2"" I mean this flick is just flat out great!!!!! I love it!! Weather people want to admit it or not this flick has alot of the same quality atmosphere that (T.C.M.)has. The psycho in this flick is a psycho!!! He reminds u of all three sick-os in (T.C.M.)""leatherface"" ""weasley little brother"" & ""the cook"" all rolled up in one nuttt cake of a dude & in my opinion thats where 75% of the creeeepy sick-o atmosphere comes from. The other 25% is split between the gator & the isolated setting. This is TOBE HOOPER'S ultimate underrated movie & I truley believe that this movie would have been recieved much better by the public & critics if it wasn't for the massive sucsess of ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" & also if it wasn't released so soon after (T.C.M.) there might have been some breathing room for it to blossom on its own. Anyway I think this belongs in every true fanz horror collection with out a doubt!! So get it! Later on fellow horror fanz!!! E!!!N!!!J!!!O!!!Y!!!   "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,I Love This Workout!,"I purchased this workout DVD on the recommendation of my sister.  She was right on when she told me it was a good workout.  I sweat big time and yet find it uncomplicated and easy to follow.  I am not the most coordinated person in the world so doing lots of fancy combos on aerobic workouts doesn't work for me.  This was straightforward, got my heart rate up, and as I said, I sweat."
dvd,14 of 26,4.0,This documentary was a bit weak,"9-11 was meticulously planned out by our government. If people do not believe me, go read and study that day like it was your babay and you'll find the truth. I was a bit skeptical at first as well. Now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in. This isn't the UNited States of America, this is the beginning of a NEw World Order. Don't believe me, we'll probably never know, because we'll be spoonfed our news on the war in Iraq by the Corporate Media that controls and censors what we see and DON'T SEE! Don't think so? You, along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in Iraq by watching CNN (Censored News Network), or Fauxnews. It pains me that people still don't realize that there is no fight for democracy in Iraq. Its a fight for Imperial Ambitions, we need Iraq for Oil, and to set up a puppet government so it doesn't scare Israel, our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of ""radical muslim fundamentalists."" No one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself, instead of relying on ""experts"" who ""know"" what is going on. I thought we were intelligent people, us Americans? Most of you can't even figure out wat the problem really is. Its our corrupt government"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,"charming, enjoyable, flawed","i rented 'charade' this past weekend based on a good friend's recommendation.  as with virtually every other red-blooded, heterosexual male, i find audrey hepburn irresistable for her beauty, charm and vulnerability, all of which are in full supply in 'charade.'"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Break His Heart and I'll Break Your Face ... Memorable Line!,This was the most memorable line in the whole movie... when the tom girl in love with her best guy friend tells the popular girl to watch out! Hmmm... this should have been a signal that she was a keeper. The 80's was really captured in this movie and it signals the genres theme of teenage turmoil in a greedy decade. I'm glad the best friends ended up together. Sometimes it's true that our feelings run deep and we have no idea until a rival comes along
dvd,1 of 8,1.0,"First one=intriguing, second one=biggest mistake ever, third one= redemption",Now the Second one is pretty bad and tries too hard to be as good as the first.  It is very hard to create a sequel as good as the first but this one certainly proves that point.  Jurassic park two Lost world is worth it compared to this one.  don't even waste the $3.00
dvd,6 of 8,5.0,Simply The Best,"This box set, is whats the word? Fascinating, it measures up for the excellent movies."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"The marriage between a dove, and elephant and genius.","This movie is one of the best i've ever seen. besides the fact that its on one of my favorite artists, Frida Kahlo, the filming was very original and interesting and showd most of her painting intertwined in the storyline. very very good editing and filming. In this movie, you can see the life of Frida and get somewhat into her head of what she was thinking when she painted. her paintings are amazing."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Demons...Hell Yeah!," This is a great 80's horror movie. It's dubbed english over italian, but you won't even notice. It's a movie about a bunch of people who get free tickets to a movie that happens to be a porthole to summon Demons. If you like old horror movies you will love demons, also check out demons2"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,"Please, Paramount - or Whoever Has the Rights - Bring This Out on DVD","I just want to add my voice to those asking - pleading - for The Conformist to be released in a subtitled version on DVD. I first saw The Conformist when it was released about 35 years ago, and have had the good fortune to see it a few times since. (At the risk of rubbing salt in the wound of reviewer James Luckard, I did get to see it when it was at the Nuart in L.A. two years ago.) This film is just absolutely stunning in every way - Jean-Louis Trintignant is of course a great actor, but the thing I find so overwhelming with this film is the way the story, the acting, the cinematography, the lighting, the music, everything just comes together so well"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,As good as the BBC production,Comparable in quality to the BBC production in six parts starring Colin Firth as Darcey and that was not easy to achieve.
dvd,5 of 8,2.0,preachy - but not in the way you'd imagine,"I checked this out because I wanted to take a look at what the new Doctor Who people have been doing in the recent past.  The Second Coming isn't quite as cosmic, but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy. Steve Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) has an epiphany one night when he's out on the town with some mates. He reckons he's become the Son of God and he proceeds to turn night into day at Maine Road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely-chosen status (a bit like David Icke, except with powers). His immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the `new disciples' some of them - notably Judith his girlfriend (Lesley Sharp) - remain sceptical. Through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a `Third Testament'. It later transpires that if they do not, the end of the world will soon follow."
dvd,1 of 5,5.0,Outrageous,"Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways.  The thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times, and I am pretty good at understanding accents.  Mark's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible.  Not just a heroin-is-bad story, but a true slice of life flick"
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,Compelling Drama sabotaged by Marketing Campaign that tried to make it an Action movie!,I finally got around to watching this movie last night (after buying it for $4 on DVD a few weeks ago) and I can say I was very pleasantly surprised by it after reading so many negative reviews.  
dvd,,4.0,the champ in czechoslovakia,"this is a charming comedy set against the backdrop of the velvet revolution, wherein a middle-aged musician (reduced to playing for funerals) marries a russian immigrant for money, and subsequently inherits her child when she takes off for a better opportunity. in a movie that could have been cloying, it is consistently fresh and funny, watching the eventual bonding twixt curmudgeon and urchin. maybe its not the type of movie i usually go for -- but i did.

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"If you love Kylie, you'll absolutely love this DVD","This DVD is an outstanding video collection of Kylie's greatest hits. From her younger days to the present, she performs so effortlessly throughout all of these videos with the energy, passion, and sensuality that she is well-known for. It would be difficult to name a particular favorite, however, several that come to mind are ""Never Too Late"", ""Better the Devil You Know"", ""Step Back in Time"", ""Slow"", and ""Red Blooded Woman"". If you love Kylie, you'll absolutely love this DVD.    "
dvd,,4.0,A few things I didn't like but mostly I loved it,"Just finished watching season 2 and I was glad I bought it. The first few episodes were okay, didn't really like the story lines. Too much time spent with new members of the cast. But once the series got rolling all the old magic came back. If you loved season 1 you will not be disappointed with season 2. I wish there had been some commentary tracks, the extras are weak but the shows are solid"
dvd,4 of 5,1.0,"Potentially very hot, but sucked instead!",I generally like some of these French-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic.  Jane Fonda's role in Barbarella comes to mind.  This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.
dvd,,5.0,Veronica Mars The Complete First Season,"Excellent show, love Veronica Mars cant wait for the 3rd Season."
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Point Pleasant taken away far too soon,This was definitley a show worth Tivo-ing to rewatch for all the little nuances missed.  Sadly as most every review (except the confused one that actually compares this to Twin Peaks?!) shows how idiotic FOX network is in constantly bringing cutting edge shows to TV to suck us in and cancel just as the series finds it's way through the story line.  Thank goodness Lost or Supernatural wasn't on Fox! 
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,A Documentary More Suspenseful Than Any Hollywood Blockbuster!,This documentary follows 10 different kids from very different backgrounds to their competition in the national spelling bee.You learn the many different ways they prepare and then you finally find out if all their hard work pays off... The hopes and dreams of the kids comes down to words so long and odd I've never heard of half of them before!The competition will keep you on the edge of your seat.You might assume a movie about spelling would be pretty boring but Spellbound has enough triumph and heartbreak to keep you glued to the screen.Stuff this riveting you can't make up...don't miss this one
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,"Travolta's Acting, Hall's Cinematography Elevate This Big-Time","On my first viewing of this, on VHS, I thought it okay but nothing special, but when I obtained the DVD and I looked at it again - wow!"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,DINO'S NUMBER#1,"It's great that the studio's is finally putting out a Matt Helm box set at a really great price compared to the more expensive separate versions.Any fan of 60's spy movies will love this set.Dean Martin's tongue is firmly in his cheek, and the women ,Tina Louise,Sharon Tate,Ann Margret,and many many more,what more can I say.Highly recommended!"
dvd,,5.0,Loved it!!!,I really loved this movie! It was so enjoyable. A really offbeat funny feelgood movie! However my American husband lasted all of 10 minutes as he could not understand the accent. I would still highly recommend this movie (maybe with subtitles for those not from Commonwealth countries
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,SUPER FEEL GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE TO WATCH FOR EITHER THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OR THE SUPER DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND, OR  THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY SOUND TRACK, THIS IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE TO HAVE FOR EITHER A FAMILY NIGHT MOVIE OR JUST FOR FUN.......BUY IT AND ENJOY IT.........."
dvd,,4.0,tell the movie man what your talent do.........,"this movie is one of my guilty pleasures. i can always pop it in the dvd player when i need a laugh. i particularly am amused by Denise Richard's priceless facial expressions, and Ellen Barkin's role is hilarious. not for those who actually take the concept of beauty pageants seriously. thanks Michael Patrick Jann for this comedic treat"
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Irish Dancing At It's Best,"I actually rented this before buying it and it looks like this will be added to my shopping cart real soon because this DVD is great. The show itself is just really good. The story is your basic love triangle fairy tale where the the betrothed lady, Grania, goes for the ""other man"" Diarmiud. So we see where they meet and the consequences of their actions especially after the hubby, Finn McCool finds out. Major bonus points to the editors who titled each segment making the story a cinch to understand. It's obvious that Jean & Colin wanted to push Irish dance into a new direction and they have succeeded. They really utilize the form to tell the story with dynamic and innovative performances that still embody traditional Irish dance values. Along with sensational music and beautiful costumes this is a must have. The most impressive aspect of this DVD is the behind the scenes documentary on the process of bringing ""Dangerous Ground"" to the stage. It was so eye-opening to see what it takes to bring these seemingly simplistic shows to life. And hearing input from the dancers, especially Colin and Jean, added more depth to the actual show because I had a sense of what they felt before the curtain raised on opening night. I would actually recommend watching the doc. before watching the show to get the full experience of this amazing show. I truly hope that Dunne and Butler continue to make more ""ground"" breaking shows such as this one. Definitely a must have for dance and theatre lovers."
dvd,30 of 31,5.0,"""To give sense to life you have to escape, change""","This wonderful Italian movie is about relationships, from the point of view of four men in their early thirties who have them, but don't fully understand what a good relationship is about. There are lots of stories, but one theme: love, betrayal, and the growing pains of men who refuse to grow up. One of them, Paolo (Claudio Santamaria), sums up quite well the feeling of the four friends: ""To give sense to life,"" he says, ""you have to escape, change"". "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Required,Every family in the United States should have a copy and review it often.
dvd,5 of 8,4.0,A Powerful Documentary...,"Spellbound offers an intriguing and thoughtful cinematic experience, which is slightly disconnected, as most people cannot even comprehend the stress that the children in the national spelling bee experience.  Nonetheless, this review will try to muster a description of how it might feel to be one of the children in the national spelling bee in Washington D.C."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The fifth Walt Disney classic now on DVD,"Bambi is a story of a deer who tries to survive in the forest. Bambi meets Feline, a young deer and he falls in love with her. They make babies and Bambi becomes King of the Forest. This is a sweet movie with an impresive soundtrack and wonderfull characters now restored to its original brilliance. Buy it. It's worth every penny."
dvd,,5.0,Favorite DVD to watch during lunch time,"After searching for the perfect visual to keep kids in my school cafeteria from getting too bored I found BMG and simply love it.  Most of these kids are from the hood and have never even seen anyone with an all blue face, LOL.   "
dvd,0 of 4,2.0,Kubrick was right: it's bad.,"Spartacus is a depressingly awful, monumental bore awash in mushy sentimentality, unworthy of its subject and a disgrace to the Roman Empire. The film works best if viewed as a mini-film for the first hour until the revolt at the Gladiator school. The Saul Bass opening credits are super-cool and the icky romance has not yet begun."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Rich and Strange,Somehow I managed to get through a childhood as a confirmed book worm without ever reading The Wind in the Willows. I am not sure how that happened. I am sure that I am glad that I finally fixed the omission. 
dvd,,4.0,Decent Cardio,I've tried this a few times.  It's not as challenging as I thought it would be.  Didn't quite break a sweat.  Some moves take some getting used to.  Felt like I had two left feet until I did the workout a 3rd time.  Tami moves from routine to routine at a pretty quick pace.  Can be hard on the knees with the hopping and the fast-paced plies.  Will try again and see if the pliometric exercises do the job
dvd,5 of 9,4.0,A nice mental exercise for geeks,"I watched the director's cut version twice and still couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie. Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't ""get it"" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part. "
dvd,11 of 18,4.0,Top Notch,"Moore is not for everyone. He is for the open-minded individual that is not afraid to ask the question 'why'. This was a beautiful series that has made me happy to see on DVD. For those that cannot stand his longer films, this would be the perfect venue to view his topics. "
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,"""My Pops used to always say dreamin' is the luxury of children, and that I should enjoy it.""","In a world where trailers often give away too much and always seem to include the best bits in the movie (and sometimes good bits that are not even in the movie), it was so refreshing to see a movie that was both surprisingly different from what the trailer indicated and a whole better than the trailer.  The trailer for ""ATL,"" which is not an acronym but short for Atlanta, makes it seem like this is a movie where a bunch of male African-American teenagers were going to prove themselves by winning this big team roller skating competition.  So it looks like you have a bit of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" a little of whatever movie with roller skating you like (""Roller Ball"" seems a bit forced, but it was that of ""Xanadu""), and the teenage coming to age film of your choice.  But ""ATL"" is more ambitious in scope and execution, and in the end I was reminded more of ""Boyz in the Hood"" than anything else, and I do not think director Chris Robinson's film suffers all that much by the comparison."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Stunning Film Treatment Of The Famous H. G Wells Sci Fi Story,"The 1960 film version of ""The Time Machine"", was always one of my absolute favourites growing up and rewatching it now as an adult I appreciate now even more the great effort put in by the legendary George Pal and his talented cast and technical crew in bringing this story vividly to life. Their attention to detail, and creation of what are still awe inspiring special effects were of course created using their collective imaginations without the help of today's computers. I'm not going into exclamations as others have about the effects appearing ""dated"", by today's standards as that is a pointless exercise and really why is there a need to compare efforts such as this made in 1960 with the technology available to movie makers today? I look at the film in the context of the time it was made in and in this way it can be seen that ""The Time Machine"", was very state of the art entertainment upon its release. Using the excellent literary source in the famous novel by H.G. Wells, MGM studios in a last gasp of its famous move making finesse fashioned an exciting, thought provoking, and above all else spectacular story here that looks as fresh today as it did over 45 years ago. What is so totally impressive about this film version still for me is the marvellous depiction of the passage of time once the story gets under way and this progression by Rod Taylor on his time machine from New Years Eve 1899 through many thousands of years into Earth's future is still one of the greatest science fiction sequences ever filmed in any decade. George Pal's brilliance in visual design is wonderfully evident in every frame of these scenes where he shows the passing of time by the continual speeded up rising and setting of the sun and moon and best of all by a wonderful idea of continually showing the clothes on a mannequin standing in a neighboring shop window continually changing as the fashions progress over many decades. The time machine itself is a wonderful piece of movie making design and in the decades since the film's release has really taken on a whole life of its own as probably one of the most famous movie props ever created. For all sci fi film lovers like myself this wonderful piece of imaginative construction along with the whole classic movie to which it belongs has assumed an appropriately timeless quality and illustrates yet again the genius that was movie maker George Pal."
dvd,,5.0,Love it!,"I was so happy when this show was released to DVD because I loved it then and missed it not being carried on my local cable company in reruns.  What made this set extra special was that I never remember these episodes being broadcast in color and if the color was added, they did a phenomenal job."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A box of good stuff,"A couple years ago, Warner Brothers issued a top-notch set of its classic gangster movies.  Included were such all-time greats as Little Caesar, Public Enemy and White Heat.  On the heals of that boxed set, a new one was issued: the Tough Guys boxed set.  This companion piece to the Gangster set features slightly less well-known movies but is definitely worth watching."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,THE GREATEST WRESTLER OF THE 20th CENTURY,"In a span of nearly four decades has no wrestler ever captivated the imagination of so many wrestling fans around the world...and I would even include HOGAN, RHODES, THESZ, AND SAMMARTINO to this small list...but FLAIR is the man!!! I bought this DVD and was quite surprised that WWE left off several key matches in his career...some matches that in one way or another ignited other memberable storylines,ie. THE VON ERICH/ FREEBIRD feud at REUNION STAR WARZ 1982 in which FLAIR and KERRY wrestled for the National Wrestling Alliance World Title and MICHAEL HAYES was the guest referee, in which Terry Gordy slams the cage door on Kerry's head..nor was the 1984 PARADE OF CHAMPIONS MEMORIAL TO DAVID VON ERICH in which Kerry captures the NWA title,(at that time the largest crowd to watch a match 48,000 fans at TEXAS STADIUM) Nevertheless, this DVD is just pure adrenaline...and every fan that pays a ticket to any of his matches know they are going to get every thing out of him. Whether you booed the hell out of him or cried with him when he gave so many emotional interviews be it ""shoot"" or script you have to respect him...and being a fan from Dallas, Texas I always rooted for him when he came through town...even against the home town VON ERICHS...The one thing I hate that Vince Mc Mahon did not give him a platform to at least compete for a world title match this year to celebrate his 25TH ANNIVERSARY of winning his first ""world"" title September 17, 1981. The extras and promos are classic and timeless. I like the way he would egg the crowd on..and holla out, ""You shut your mouth fat-bot...""...you keep that up honey,and I'll take you home and make a real woman out of you...and his rants about being Secratariat in disguise...just totally funny...and that's what you need to be a good professional wrestler, you have to know how to move the crowd and cause a stir....I think when he finally retires the boots, there will be a lineage and legacy that will retire with him as well...If you're a wrestling purist this DVD is for you...if you want a little history of the business and classic matches this is the one also a great buy...."
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,I personally love this,"I loved Stella.  It was fantastic.  After losing her job, Stella goes with her friend (Whoopie) to Jamaica and one thing leads to another and she meets a hot hunky guy who she falls in love with and they maintain their relationship long distance.  She even goes back with her son so he can meet this guy and wouldn't you know it, but he comes back to America to be with her.  It's funny at times, sad and moving at times but overall it's enjoyable at all times.  The book was a bit better I think, but the dvd had beautiful scenery and great music"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"5 Stars for the Movie, 1 Star for the Miramax Version","The movie - as a movie - is excellent. This is what Beatlemania was to all of us. The movie won all types of industry awards and, for us kids at the time, firmly restated what we all knew: that the Beatles were sensational."

dvd,,5.0,Reflections in a golden eye is golden again,"Yes,the disk of relections in a golden eye is indeed in the original golden colored treatment as intended by director John Huston.Restored by Warner Bros you can now see this great film in the version intended by its creator.A unique experience.Forty years ahead of its time.A must for film collectors and admirers of Huston as a director.The color treatment adds immeasurably  to the  power of the narrative and lends a hypnotic and dreamlike edge to this disturbing and provocative film.Get it.Hard to believe the packaging does not mention the gold in this collection."
dvd,,4.0,"More engrossing, less adventure-filled","Younger audience members, especially avid Potter fans, may be disappointed at the lack of adventure in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" I don't recall there being anything in this installment to match the action scenes of the previous two films, although this is a more engrossing, story-laden picture. What the other movies dabbled with in adventure, this one promotes with character development and internal transition. The characters in the story, particularly Harry, receive more emotional attention from the director. This Potter flick is a smidgen better than ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", but it has drawbacks keeping it from becoming a classic."

dvd,,4.0,"Fun, Fast-Paced Action Yarn","""Jurassic Park III"" saves the ""Jurassic Park"" series from sinking into the bloated ""Great movie followed by wretched sequel"" genre.  ""The Lost World"" was such a bad film that I waited for this particular sequel to hit the DVD shelves and satellite TV before watching it.  It strays a little from the original film's formula by dropping the bulk of the suspense and horror as well as running time and dives right into the action sequences with those ever-wonderful lookin' dinosaurs."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A slap in the face!,"If I was required about the boldest and daring film of the early Forties around the dark shadows hovering over the free world, I should include this one among the most representative and sharping in that historical moment."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,At 44 years old I still have my skateboard...,Moving to Hawaii in the mid 70's when skateboarding was just getting big started it all for me. I bought Skateboarder magazine all the time back then and felt giddy when I recognized the cover in the movie. The same guys in the movie were the ones I tried to copy. It was like seeing old friends.
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,"""No, It's Completely Baked""  ~  Sixties Angst And Rebellion","I can remember sitting through back to back showings of `The Graduate' in a now defunct Whittier theater when it was originally released in '67. I was a sophomore in high school at the time and as I remember there were several reasons why I put in the extra time to sit through a second viewing. One reason was to see that incredibly sexy night club stripper (Lainie Miller) perform again.  Hey, I was sixteen, raging hormones, you know the story. Anyway that was one reason. The other was because it was hilarious and there was so much laughing going on in the audience that I missed a lot of what was being said the first time. I had to see it again just to catch all the subtle jokes and comic nuances."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"""You can't change what you're meant to be""","Got rained out this past Saturday night so I trotted this 50 year old plus film out. It's still great and but for the dialogue, which makes sense although still a little whimsical, this is by far on anyone's short list of great westerns."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The Jungle Book.,"A true delight for the whole family. Sabu is a remarkable talent for his age and the overall quality of the film (including excellent colour quality & detail) made it most enjoyable when sharing it with our grandchildren (ages 11 & 15) who reacted with delight from beginning to end. Considering the digital age was a couple generations away, it is a remarkable product of cinematography at its best. I would highly recommend it for any generation to enjoy."
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Film-Noir at It's Best,"Film-noir is hard to do. Film-noir isn't about plot; It's about mood, tone, and look. When it was originated in the 40s, it was all very well done by directors who didn't know they were making ""noir."" Now that directors actually set out to do that, it usually doesn't succeed. In ""Body Heat,"" the directorial debut of Lawrence Kasdan and the screen debut of Kathleen Turner, he crafts noir in a 40s-ish way but never fails to remind you in almost every scene that the film takes place in the 1980s. William Hurt, in his second film (just a year or two before he'd win an Oscar for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"") plays a lawyer named Ned Racine. Ned lives in Florida (where a heat wave seems to be occuring), is lazy and cocky and has a way with women. Then he meets Matty (Turner), a married woman that manages to exert sexiness with her clothes on rarely seen since Marilyn Monroe died. Ned and Matty being a passionate love affair, but soon Matty explains that her husband needs to die."
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,"Good short Callanetics routines, but DVD lacks chaptering","I first tried Callanetics for via the original 60-minute program. I liked the short, targeted, effective movements, but because it was difficult for me to find time to do the entire workout, I decided to give the AM/PM tape a try. The two 20-minute workouts on this DVD include a majority of the exercises from the original video (some have been left out). Although the workouts are designed to be used in the morning (energizing) and in the evening (relaxing), the inclusion of moves in either the AM or PM routine seemed arbitrary to me. In addition, I found the 20 minute format to be a bit TOO short for my liking; just when I was starting to feel like I was getting a good workout, it was over. For some people, however, this time period might be ideal, and these workouts do offer a good introduction to the Callanetics method. As always, Callan is a gentle, supportive, and encouraging instructor who constantly reassures her students that they can go at their own pace. Callanetics is a great alternative exercise style to incorporate into your fitness routine, and if you are pressed for time, these workouts offer an ideal solution"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,This movie is a treasure. Truly.,"This is one of those movies you recommend to strangers because you're absolutely certain they'll love it the way you do. Watching Meryl Streep in anything is pleasurable, but watching her be the dying mother of Renee Zellweger's character is a treasure. There are moments in the movie (and the book) when you are suddenly aware there is a shift happening inside you... you have been moved in a way you seldom are, and you don't forget it. When Kate (Streep) and Ellen (Zellweger) stand together at the lighting of the Christmas trees, you shift. When Kate explains the complicity of marriage to a bitter Ellen, you shift. When Kate pleads for an end to her pain... it's just heart-wrenching. The movie is quiet, rather than in your face, and that is part of it's treasure. It's also just as good as the book - not one where you walk away wishing you'd stopped after the book. It is a wonderful movie, one you'll want to keep in your collection of gems"
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Very good buy,"Always been a Buffy fan, and getting all the seasons boxed together like this at this price - a bargain in anyone's books."

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Disturbing Thriller About Religious Fanaticism,"This directorial debut from actor Bill Paxton, who also stars in the film, is highly recommended. I am looking forward to his future films, if this is what his first film is like. With imaganitive writing and excellent acting, this film is as creepy as they come. The underlining theme deals with religious fanaticism; and yet the ending leaves you with a question mark concerning whether one of the brothers is more than just a religious fanatic. [As a film of course]. I cannot tell you anything more about the brothers without ruining the film for you. Therefore, there will be no spoilers in this review."
dvd,0 of 3,4.0,Selleck and Liala Robbins triumph,"Although the dialog is sometimes a bit corny, the actors do a fine job of making this movie work.  You care about the characters and their ordeals.  It's worth watching"
dvd,6 of 16,4.0,"If you like to listen to boys talk, this is for you.","Touted as the definitive work on electronica, the guys start talking and never stop. Though many interesting observations about the genre from its origins in disco to the influence of diverse races and cultures are effectively made, some questions receive scant attention.  For example, while there is an interesting scene which shows how the equipment itself is made by women, every performer interviewed, spoken of, or filmed is male which makes one wonder what that might be all about?"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,    THis movie is hilarious! I love it. I remember the first time I watched it I cracked up. I have no idea why you people are giving it bad reviews! Adam Sandler and John Turtorro where great in this movie highly reccomended
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Callenetics 10 years younger in 10 hours,This is a great exercise routine that keeps me limber and strong.  I have had the video since it came out in the eighties and I'm so glad to have it on cd now that the technology is changing. This is one exercise workout that really does what it proclaims to do.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,This DVD is as addicting as heroin!,My friends and myself included have been quoting material on this CD for months!  I am actually ordering another copy because a friend of mine wants to keep the first copy I bought.  
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Western Grimms Fairy tale!,"In the US Clint Eastwood does not have the legendary reputation of artistic merit as he does in Europe.  If you watch this film closely, you see greatness not just in Clint but for Sergio Leone, the director, whose film-making transformed the Western film genre.  "
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,One of the Greatest Films of All Time!!!,"In spite of the rather hackneyed expression which I preface this review, Eisenstein has given us not only one of the most powerful films of all time, but also  an incredible visual experience.  The vastness of Russian steepes is so well caught that one feels one is part of this film.  As a result of this film Eisenstein really made a profound imprint on Cinema and gave film emotion."
dvd,10 of 15,5.0,A down to earth connection,"It's how many years later? and I still seek to find any DVD's available for this program. Somehow I relate to each character and the lifestyle they lived. For my birthday, my husband drove me to Roslyn, Washington where the show was filmed to see what it looked like. The whole town looked exactly like it did in the show. Even the people there were warm and friendly, just living life. In this season, my favorite episode of all time ""Hello, I love you"" aired. I was pregnant with my child and if given a chance to experience what Shelly did, I would have given my right arm. Again, I can connect with what's going on. Today, I find solace in watching those episodes and find comfort in old friends. Last on the list to come out is Season 6. I'll be signed up the minute it becomes available. So go watch and reminisce"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A total Betty!,"Clueless starring the charming Alicia Silverstone is such a cool and funny film from writer/director Amy Heckerling. I loved this movie when it came out in 1995, boy I am so old now! Clueless is clever, witty, smart, and oh so righteous. Look for a young and chubby Brittany Murphy, she is so good as Tai, an outsider who is looking for a little acceptance from the popular Cher (Silverstone). Cher is obsessed with clothes, boys, and finding the right pair of shoes for her picky feet. This movie is loosely based Jane Austin's classic novel, Emma but with a modern and California twist to it. Love, adore, and worship this movie. If you decide not to buy Clueless well then, Whatever!!!!!!!!"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"Historical collection, and quite interesting.",Many of the other commentators of Volume 1 and Volume 2 have very nicely described the contents of these two collections.  I'd like to just say that I found these cartoons to be very essential for anyone interested in the history of animation.  
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,One of the Greatest Animated Films of All Time,"If film makers could figure out how to make a film like ""Bambi"" every time, the art of film making would be just that; an art.  ""Bambi"" is a tale that is for children.  However, that tale contains every element present in the life of a typical child: friendship, love, parental protection, loss, fear of the unknown, and, of course, growing up.  I am still astonished at how a film that clocks in at 69 minutes can capture the essence of life."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Die Hard fans will like this,"This set contains some of the best action movies to hit the big screen. Bruce Willis will be remembered by most as John McClane, a New York City detective who can't seem to keep away from those bad days. Each movie is accompanied by a second disc of goodies. Die Hard has already earned its spot in movie history. Die Hard 2: Die Harder is the underrated movie of the trilogy, yet still a great relentless action movie. Die Hard with a Vengeance is probably the most recognizable among the younger audience. My least favorite but still entertaining. "
dvd,34 of 36,4.0,When things go wrong and one is in harm's way.,"This is a chilly saga of an American sub captain plagued by failure-prone weapons and an ocean full of Japanese to fight.  They find the reason the torpedoes didn't work and put back to sea, this time, to take good care of the nasty business at hand. One scene that brings the cost of war home is that the Thunderfish loaned another sub a movie, &quot;Washington Slept Here.&quot;  Sometime later, they find wreckage of an American sub, and the movie tells them who is at the bottom of the ocean. The Thunderfish strikes back at the sub that got their friends, showing how dangerous it was out there and what courage it took to fight this war. The climax scene shows them in a Japanese-controlled harbor, with a waiting task force.  They fire their new and deadly torpedoes, and radio back to Cincpac about the taskforce and its location.  They run for cover, and barely survive massive retaliation: the outcome is in doubt until the last, as it was for many other submariners. A moving, poignant, and bittersweet tale that stresses the fact that nothing ever comes for free, even in war"
dvd,1 of 5,1.0,She's is DIRTY!,"All she sells is sex and attitude! Young kids loves that. Her voice is annoying and she's very vain, Audience has to wait for her to change outfit all the times, it's the pri=madoona attitude and she 's not even that good"

dvd,1 of 4,4.0,Great Memories,I of course watched this stuff as a kid and it brings back memories to watch it now
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The Sins of the Father become the Sins of the Son,"The Godfather by Mario Puzo is one of the best selling novels of all time, but its film adaptation, (1972) directed by the young filmmaker, Francis Coppola, set a new benchmark in epic filmmaking. What set this film apart from its contemporaries was its absolute realism and true depiction of the rise of the Sicilian mob in New York circa early twentieth century. Vito Carleone (Marlon Brando) right at the start of the film in the opening sequence at his daughter's wedding portrayed a man of few words, and the subtle presence of considerable danger."
dvd,14 of 232,2.0,It's ok....I guess...,"but come on...there's not ONE David Lynch film here, not ONE John Waters film here, not ONE film by the Cohen Brothers, and, where's films like FAT GUY GOES NUTZOID or BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA?  Where's the movies from the Big Dwarf Rodeo?  Ok, I suppose, if you've got the scratch to drop, and the hours upon hours to spend to watch some of these hacknied movies, then knock yourself out. "
dvd,5 of 8,4.0,"Good sequel, considering most sequels!",The scene with Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin makes me bawl EVERY time I see it! It is a good movie to celebrate a stage of life often dismissed. I loved it and I'm under 30
dvd,2 of 3,1.0,Not the best of John Carpenter,"This film is really sad. Sad because if you look at it closely you can find a lot of good ideas ultimately ruined by poor delivery. And knowing this is written and directed by John Carpenter, I have to wonder why it isn't any better."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Classic Mystery/Thriller That Has Lost None of it's Power,"M is a thriller that follows a serial child killer during his downward spiral, mentally and physically, to the lowest level of human depravity.  The killer, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Lorre has lost all humanity and will not stop until he is caught and brought to justice.  And this is just where it starts to get interesting because the police, in their efforts to capture the killer, are putting the squeeze on the criminal underworld.  In response, the criminals join the chase to stop this sociopath and ""put things back to normal""."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Fantastic Character Study,"You do not have to be Catholic to appreciate the towering schievement that ""The Nun's Story"" is.  This is an example of what Hollywood used to do very well in portaying an intimate character study against an epic backdrop.  Audrey Hepburn is simply tremendous as Sister Luke, a woman torn between her devotion to God and service to humanity.  Peter Finch matches her as the world-weary humanistic doctor.  As a Catholic and educated by nuns this film gave me an appreciation for the sacrifices these woman make to better serve Jesus Christ and humanity.  It's surprising that a film of this magnitude took so long to make it to DVD"
dvd,2 of 5,1.0,"Wes, Say it aint so","I have hope that someday Wes Craven will return to greatness, that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like Scream 2, cursed, and Dracula 2000. I have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""The Last House on the Left"", but alas ""Red Eye"" fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies. First of all, the flick is PG-13, which means no blood, no sex, and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot. A pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes.  I must admit there are directors that can pull off a PG-13 horror flick but Wes Craven is not one of the chosen few."
dvd,7 of 15,1.0,"Undeveloped, unfinished art. Don't see it.","With no expectations, I joined my partner in watching this movie. I was intrigued, because I share several of the main character's fetishes (including the central, dog/animalism theme). The movie reminds me of a college student's attempt-a movie based on ""cool"" gimmicks, poor research, underdeveloped ideas, and amateur video and audio work (technically speaking) that I could have done better on my Powerbook."
dvd,2 of 4,2.0,Subtexts,On the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama.
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,I Haven't Laughed This Hard in Years!,"I love this DVD.  It makes me laugh, sigh, hope, giggle, howl, titter, and just go AHHH HAHHHH!"
dvd,5 of 10,5.0,Buster Keaton is a comedy god.,"If you like Buster Keaton, I highly suggest you buy this along with the Buster Keaton Collection that has THE CAMERAMAN, SPITE MARRIAGE, and FREE AND EASY. This set has 10 full length movies, a sort of ""mini movie"" that's around 45 minutes (Sherlock, Jr.), and many shorts (most of the time two on a disc). Some of the full length movies aren't that good but have great shorts on the same disc. I don't like GO WEST, THE SAPHEAD, THE THREE AGES, or BATTLING BUTLERS as much as COLLEGE, THE NAVIGATOR, THE GENERAL, SHERLOCK, JR., STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., OUR HOSPITALITY, and SEVEN CHANCES. I can't think of a short I didn't like. I think some of his best work was in his shorts. If you have never seen Buster Keaton, I suggest going to Blockbuster or Netflix and rent THE GENERAL, STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., and SEVEN CHANCES to see if you like his work. I think you will. BUT BE WARNED. IF YOU HATE SILENT MOVIES, DON'T BUY THIS. ALL OF THE MOVIES AND SHORTS ARE SILENT. As for me, I don't care"
dvd,0 of 6,1.0,Absolute Terrible,"Weak forced dialogue, silly overly thought plot, unsympathetic characters, and unfunny and you have Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I saw a clip of Robert Downey accidentally audition for a part from this movie and thought it was going to be a funny movie about a mix up, where a crook gets to be come an actor solving a murder mystery. "
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,life as art,"A visually hypnotic film around a contagiously simple tale. The Wise One's temple hut on the lake - more or less the physical heart of the film's story - is treated like heaven's courtyard, with stupefying cinematography to linger in your mind long after. The alluring mystery of land and water, gorgeously invoked, enshrines with perfect balance a brutally real story of redemption and acceptance. Through each season's segment, director Kim Ki-Duk frees a vital flow that deeply mirrors the Buddhist essence. Best, it's a spiritual film that miraculously escapes becoming a moral fable. The conscious absence of sentimentality leaves truth alive and real, and points silently to cinema's inherent art, to reveal the Buddhist aesthetic. It's a beautiful movie, well worth the time and money. Not Buddhist? you'll love it anyway because truth is all around us, but for Buddhists the film offers unique lessons without distraction, and that's refreshing. The winter scenes of ice and snow (including a waterfall frozen in full plunge!) are among the most pungent, and beautiful, and also contain key elements of the story itself. My favorite scene is the penitent carving overnight the Heart Sutra characters on the deck floor, at the direction of the Master; Buddhists call the Prajnaparamita Sutra the holy mother that feeds the practitioner with wisdom - clearly the source of Director Kim Ki-Duk's rich vision. I'm really grateful a friend turned me to this movie. Urgently recommended"
dvd,,4.0,Surprisingly Good!,"Freddy vs. Jason (as in Nightmare on Elm Street Part VIII and Friday the 13th Part XI, all in one) sheds light on a pair of familiar, though not too friendly, faces: that of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.  Freddy, who has successfully been forgotten by the community he has been terrorizing, uses Jason as a means by which to implicate himself in a series of gruesome murders, hence allowing him to return in people's fears and subsequently their dreams. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Infinitely improved by being on DVD,"Now that Rattle and Hum is on DVD, the brightest moments shine so much brighter and the low lights are eliminated through the magic of the fastforward button. The menu allows you to pick which song you want to see performed and oh what performances. The versions of ""Exit"" and ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Both are liable to send a chill down your spine. The live versions captured here of Bullet the Blue Sky, With or Without You, Running to Stand Still and others are also excellent. In 5.1 sound, it's nothing short of brilliant"
dvd,2 of 7,2.0,Most of All You've Got to Hide it From the Kids,"There is nothing better than finding out your family history is the basis of a book and movie especially when it's a salacious one. That would be the premise, and pretty ingenious one, for Rumor Has It... The movie follows Jennifer Aniston (Leprechaun) as she slowly starts to realize that her mother and grandmother were the people who inspired The Graduate. Throwing a bigger wrinkle into her life is the possible that the real life Dustin Hoffman character could be her father."
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,A great Set for Collectors of James Bond,The question to ask yourself is this: are these sets worth the money?
dvd,,4.0,Where Has My Childhood Gone ?,"I love the Turtles. When I was a kid, I had all the toys, figures, all the comics, I saw all the movies, I drew them constantly, and I even had the live concert tape and video. When I was watching this dvd, I was amazed that I remembered all the words to the theme song. Sure, the way the turtles acted/spoke was a lot less serious and ""adult"" than the original comics, but this was a cartoon for kids, after all. I was also amazed that I could remember just about everything that was going to happen next. Amazing, since I hadn't seen any of these episodes in about 16 years. The quality of the episodes are great considering the age of the material. I'm not sure if they remastered the episodes at all, but if they didn't, I'm surprised the show is in such great clarity. If you want to relive your childhood and all the good memories to go along with it, then pick this dvd up"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Shovelling against a tide of despair,"This bittersweet film is the story of a Trevor (Haley Joel Osment), a 7th grader in Reno who lives with his alcoholic mother Arlene (Helen Hunt) and is becoming embittered by the seeming hopelessness of his life. His life take a turn when his new teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey) gives his class an odd assignment: do something that will change the world. Trevor's approach is to something good (and big!) for three people, on the condition that they do something as significant to three others, and so on. Soon, Trevor is bringing home bums and trying to get his mother married."
dvd,,4.0,A respectable entry in the annals of the best Westerns!,Henry Hathaway was a versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as his other films...
dvd,0 of 3,4.0,Decent,"I think this movie isn't bad at all,Yeah it's not a movie I want to watch all the time but I think it is a fine low budget zombie flick,check it out"
dvd,,5.0,Love this movie,"""When Harry Met Sally"" is one of my favorite films.  It's one of those movies you can watch again and again, and never get sick of it.  Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are hilarious, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are excellent in their supporting roles.  I can't recommend this movie enough. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,I love this movie!,"I absolutly love the Acceleracers series! I first got into the series when my little brother got the World Race DVD for his birthday. I immediately got into the whole thing. I probably like Hot Wheels now as much or more than he does! The cars are super cool and so is the story line. I was a bit dissapointed about some of the character changes (namely Markie and Taro), but I still think it's an awesome movie. I will have to agree with all the moms out there when I say that this is NOT for younger kids. When this premired on Cartoon Network, it was given a Y7 rating and I think that's true. My brother is currently 5, but he's ok watching it. My 3 year old sister even likes watching it (her favorite character is Monkey). But I think it's alot better than the first movie, World Race, and deserves to be seen by little boys (over the age of 5). Who knows? You may like it better than your kids do"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,I Want to Have the Time of My Life,"Beautiful, beautiful, BEAUTIFUL movie. This is the ultimate love story in a more innocent time.  This movie captures the innocence of that first love, and how real everything is.  I've watch this movie probally close to fifty times, and it NEVER gets old. Of course I am the hopeless romantic, but even people who are not into romance movies would enjoy this timeless film. This would have to be one of (if not) my favorite movies of all times.  ""I've Had the Time of My Life"" makes you want to be in love for the first time all over again."
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Subtle and hysterical,"I just love love love ""Keeping Up Appearances"" with Hyacinth Bucket and her family/friends.  I first found them on PBS and fell in love with everything about the show.  This collection covers the entire run of the series and the extras are wonderful.  (Who knew Dominic Monaghan (from ""Lost"") was Patricia Routledge's sidekick on her detective show after ""Keeping"" completed it's run.)  You will not be disappointed with this very reasonably priced collection.  It hasn't left my DVD player.  American sitcom writers could learn a thing or two about subtlety and wringing laughs from something as simple as answering the phone.  British humor rules and Hyacinth Bucket is the Queen"
dvd,,4.0,Be funny,"Great movie, although it is very similar to get shorty I liked this one better, just because Uma Thurman rock"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,One of the best DVDs ever!!,"Like my title says, this DVD is one of the best DVDs ever made. For months I wanted to buy it, but I just couldn't afford it. So I saved up for it and it was worth every penny. This also happens to be one of my all-time favorite movies so when I found out that the anniversary edition was available, I ordered it as soon as I could. This DVD has some really amazing features that I have not seen in any anniversary DVD so far. It has deleted scenes; Bruce Springsteen's Streets of Philadelphia music video; courthouse protest footage and interviews; Joe Miller's Macready & Shilts Legal Services TV spot; filmographies and more!! This is one of those DVDs you'll need to buy in order to have an awesome experience of how really great an anniversary edition can be. Though I have to say that I don't know if they are all this good. "

HOWEVER, ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT IS GETTING VENGEANCE ON THE COP THAT CAUGHT HIM [MARIO VAN PEEBLES] AND THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED GET HIM CONVICTED. A VERY SUSPENSEFUL MOVIE THAT NEVER LETS UP. THE ACTING IS GOOD, THE ACTION IS GOOD, AND THE PLOT IS GOOD. I RECCOMEND ACTION FANS TO PICK THIS MOVIE UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,3 women - true work of art,"for all fans of the divine sissy spacek, this is robert altman's dream like masterpiece. just over 2 hours of stunning visuals (excellent use of widescreen, film is wasted in the tv format)and impeccable acting from sissy and shelley duvall, 3 women is a bewitching study of changing relationships. Rather like sissy's earlier key work, badlands, its a film that is hard to discribe. just put an evening aside, lock the doors, pour a few beers, switch off the lights and lose yourself. its a shame the altman produced welcome to l a - also with the versatile ms. spacek - is not on dvd yet. who says the art film / women's picture is dead. this is unmissable. enjoy!"
dvd,2 of 4,1.0,Fails to come to a boil,"Laura Esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate,magical novel."
dvd,,4.0,Eh...,"Calling ""The Life"" a movie would be inaccurate. It's not there to be enjoyed or to entertain; And it's more like a documentary with a pointless storyline involving Denise Richards and Daryl Hannah. The only reason I rented this movie was because Richards and Hannah were on the cover and it has a tagline that says ""What's your pleasure?"" Well, Richards and Hannah is a good start. I rented it and only when I got home did I realize that it's got a pitiful storyline interwoven with interviews. The movie is a little over 70 minutes. This is a rough estimate, but about 55 minutes is interviews...The storyline is barely there, the filmmakers have thrown the two actresses on the cover to get people to do exactly what I did. Grab the movie. They would've been better off editing out all of Richards and Hannah's stuff, because basically it's about A graduate student (Richards) who's neighbor is a prostitute (Hannah). Her grant is running out and she needs to make money, so she (kinda) takes up the world's oldest profession. There is almost no character development and you feel nothing for any of these characters. The interviews (which claim that the people aren't actors, but their dialogue sounds very scripted) don't really do what the filmmakers want. They don't leave you mortified and haunted, they basically tell you what you were already aware of and they don't speak that graphically. It's the final scene, where each prostitute reveals where they see themselves in a few years. It's a sad to see that some of these people have dug themselves so deep into this profession that they're not even sure how to dig themselves out. If you want to see a pseudo-documentary on prostitution, then you mihgt like this. If that doesn't strike your fancy, don't bother."
dvd,18 of 18,5.0,"""Classic"" Trek's Original Inspiration Finally Gets the Deluxe Treatment It Deserves","There are now out *four* different versions of the 50th Anniversary edition of ""Forbidden Planet"": 2 standard (480i) DVD sets and 2 HD-DVD sets. Both formats are available as either a super-deluxe, Ultimate Collector's Edition set offered in a thick, green and red engraved hinged metal box, as well as a standard 2-disc sleeved set. Both come with lots extras, especially the metal Ultimate. I highly recommend them to everyone if you're so inclined toward lavish DVD sets. Being a longtime ""Forbidden Planet"" fan and collector, I'm planning on buying the other three variant sets, too, because, well, I'm obsessed with FP and by now have lost all sense of proportion when ""collecting"" this terrific film. "
dvd,7 of 7,1.0,Quite horrible,"This is the most horrible documentary I've ever watched. The narrator's tone is dreadful (sounds as if the DVD were made for children) and the re-enactments are torturous. There are some high points, snips of interviews from Johnny and others, but there is very little performance, beyond what I assume would be ""fair use."" Further, this DVD really doesn't add anything, nor does it shed any new light on Johnny Cash. The A&E Biography DVD is far more enriching."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wish All Animated Films Were This Good,"I'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie."

dvd,6 of 7,4.0,I like the DVD version but.....,"    As far as the picture was concerned, I loved it. You noticed the background and the lighting is 100% better that previous versions.  Then you'll also notice some of the colors are brighter or different.  I believe most will appreciate the visual aspect of the film.  It will blow your mind if you have a HiDef. TV.  "

dvd,2 of 15,5.0,Warming,"This video will be most warming, and moist for some. Bearing in mind that stories depicted and on screen actors are not the real people, so it is the same as listening to the speakers for music.  This film will most definately do it for 'me'! hahahaaaaa some night"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Last Days in Berlin.,"Do we need another film about the Reich and the culpability of Adolph and his henchmen? Well, this film, and presumably the book, flesh out the psychological sate of paranoia surrounding the bunker in Berlin in ways I've not seen before. It's all a bit too staged and Hollywood theatrics for my tastes. Which is, given the the scenario we're witnessing, is probably sufficient endistancing to absorb the histrionics of the script. We need the apologies and explanations for redress: not just the Germans, but as another reviewer perspicaciously suggests, to  alert ourselves to similar susceptiblities within our own ranks and times. Bruno Ganz's Hitler is as good as the guy in Sokurov's, 'Moloch'. And the comparison stands for the Goering characters in both films. When Joseph Beuys and Anselm Kiefer sprung into gallery and periodical circulation in the last quarter on the C20th, the cultural world took note of Germans owning the menacing 1930s and 40s. They made brave and reparative art. The TV series,'Hamat' worked in the same vein. I don't consider this to work on the same aesthetic level as the aforementioned, but it is party to the same earnest rear vision, and that so much research could accessed through its participants, helps the authenticity of its outcome"
dvd,,5.0,The Best Movie Set In the 50s Since Grease!,"""Cry Baby"" is the coolest movie since Grease that deals with this time period. The songs are good and the actors in the film are really excellent. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp, and he came through in this movie and him in a lead role set in the 50s worked! This movie is not only a movie that takes place in the 50s, but it feels like a movie that was made in that decade as well. Everything that was big in the movies during that time are seen and used in here. I really enjoyed how this film also dealt with issues people had then and the way people acted and thought. "
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,FLCL Volumes 1 - 3,"This series must get an award for simple originality. None of the characters follow the same anime stereotypes we've come to know as anime fans. The conflict is everchanging but never out of reach. You always know what is going on, in other words. And to add to that, it has a great J-pop soundtrack. If you're tired of those stories about a male Japanese boy surrounded by many beatiful women--and who isn't--this is where to go to regenerate your love for this type of anime."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Fort Apache -- It exceeds ""The Searchers""","This is the gem of the Wayne/Ford Calvary trilogy, and I am delighted it's finally coming to DVD."
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,A must for Dragon Ball fans.,"One of a handful of stories written by Toei Animation worthy of the Toriyama original story. The film moves quick, the action is fun an intense, the characters are in full development (even the new addtions) and Dragon Fist! is just a kickass looking attack. One interesting point of the story is how it moves from one character to the next, being passed along, so it isn't focusing on a singular character. Something the other movies didn't really do. Because of this, it feels more like an American animated film (except in art style, naturally) and this brings my single complaint; It isn't long enough. The story could've been even better if played around with me. But I suppose Japanese children and teens don't have high enough attention spans... "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,The story of Noah's Ark for toddlers!!!,"My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD...with all the wonderful animals and their sounds.  The puppets are beautiful, and the music isn't tinny or annoying to my ears!"
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Absolutely DIVINE movie to watch!,"This movie was great!  I read the reviews on the site and a few were not so good...thus, I was a little leary on whether I should buy the movie vs. rent.  To my surprise... the movie came on that same night on a movie channel.  I couldn't turn away from the tv.  The movie was very touching.  The cast of charachters couldn't have been any better.  Jason Alexander, was the biggest surprise of the film.  He did an amazing job.  I will admit at first, I too was a lil leary about the flim within the first 15 minutes or so...b/c it wasn't as clear as it should have been.  However, after the plot thickened so did the movie.  This movie is a totally divine movie and a must watch for all alike.  Absolutely, I will buy this one for sure and can't to watch again and again.  BUY THIS FILM!  You won't be disapointed and if you are ...share it with a friend and they might appreciate it more and thank you for giving it as a gift"

dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Becareful! May not be suitable for toddlers.,"I thought this movie would be a lot of fun for my 2 year old who loves Elmo. I was having fun watching it in the beginning, and wish I could have seen the entire movie. However, about 15 minutes through Elmo encounters a ""scary"" helicoptor, and a villian who takes away his blanket. My daughter burst into tears. I could only console her by skipping to the end to show that Elmo got his blanket back. Two weeks after viewing she is still talking about the scary helicoptor and mean man. She, of course, would not let me put the movie in again, no matter how I assured her it was just silly and not scary"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Kids love it, why the African theme?","Good or bad, I don't remember Sesame Street having a predominantly African theme when I was watching it as a kid in the 70's and 80's.  In contrast, this video has classic Sesame Street clips sprinkled in with a very African theme.  My kids do love it.  I guess it just seems to me that a video celebrating 25 years of Sesame Street should be true to what Sesame Street was for the past 25 years"
dvd,,4.0,"Great Movie, Misleading DVD","I know it's probably all been said, but yes, I was extremely disappointed to not see the original ending included in the movie. So I watched the extras, shivering with anticipation for this mythical ""original ending."" Let down AGAIN! We aren't even given a final version! Bah! Sorry, but I've always rooted for Duckie. He at least deserved some screen time dancing with his true love."
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,Tough Lower Body Workout,"This is a 30 minute lower body sculpting workout led by Lisa Kay, one of my favorite Firm instructors. To do this workout, you need a range of dumbbells such as 5 and 8 pounds. You also need the Firm's FannyLifter, which is 14"" step made up of 6"" and 8"" segments. If you don't have the FannyLifter, you will need a sturdy step of some kind."
dvd,8 of 8,4.0,"easy to learn, difficult to master","This is not a note-for-note transcription of John Hurt's songs.  Rather, Sebastian and Traum try to convey the feel of Hurt's style as they have come to interpret it.  Not to say that they've changed the songs much -- they will get you very close, and then the finer details can be picked up by listening to the records.  Also it becomes quite easy to figure out songs not included in the DVD once you have gotten the hang of it."
dvd,9 of 13,1.0,SEASON FOR THE ORIGINAL B&B FANS!!,"I'm not a mainstream Beavis & Butthead fan...the fans that jumped on the bandwagon when they became popular.  I was there from the beginning.  Where the hell is FROG BASEBALL and BURGER WORLD.  I want to see BURGER WARS!!!!  There was a time when Beavis didn't even talk he just laughed (heh, heh, heh).  Fire....Fire!!!  I want Season 1,2,3.  Just release them as Seasons....let us be the judge of what is good and what sucks.  I want full episodes with videos included.  EVERY TV SHOW IS LIKE THIS ON DVD.  Why is this one different?!  DEMAND FULL EPISODES AND FULL SEASONS!!! "
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,Great insight to an amazing Musician,"Cale is famous for shunningthe spotlight so thats what makes this DVD Documentary such a pure joy.  You really get to know all about the man who wrote some of Claptons biggest songs (Cocaine, After Midnight) thru watching him play live, talk and return home to Tulsa where is all began.  Lots a great extras as well thru discussions with friends and family.  This is a must buy for anyone interested in what its like to be an artist on the road and how it all works as well"
dvd,3 of 6,1.0,NO George........NO!,"I rented the ""original"" Star Wars first, just to see if it was as bad as everyone says.  Good GOD!  It's horrible!  It looks only slightly better than video tape.  I read a lot of reviews stating that ""this is what fans have ask for""...honestly, I didn't ask for this.  Nobody did.  Sure we all want the choice between the original Star Wars and the Special Edition, but I think George is doing nothing but slapping us fans in the face with this release. I despertly wanted the original movies in their original form, but not like this.  I think George is basically trying to get us to admit that his special edition is better....it's not.  The way it was presented on DVD is far superior, but in my opinion, George is taking away part of our childhood with the new stuff.  for example, they remastered Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, but did they ad new characters?  Change the songs to something more ""current""?  Digitally enhance Atlanta burning? No....but they did do those transfer justice.  They look great, they sound great, and that makes for fun viewing.  This slop that George is handing us is NOT what we asked for....so George, I say to you...NO!  BAD!  If I had a rolled up newspaper, I smack you in the head with it and rub your nose this pile of....DVD's...to make sure you know better next time.  When these films get remastered again for HI-DEF, I'll buy...IF he gives us what WE want"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A compelling story,Boogie Boy is a must for anyone searching for a good story. I only recently discovered Mark Dacascos and rushed to find anything he had been in. Initially I wasn't sure I'd like this movie as it's not my usual style.  Was I wrong! From the first frames I was drawn into this compelling story  of a troubled young man trying deperately to put his life back on track.  Dacascos' potrayal of the main character was riveting. He masterfully  balances every side of this character. In one scene he's a fragile young  man seeking acceptance and &quot;normalcy&quot; and in the next he's an  angry young man just trying to survive. If you're tired of  &quot;cotton-candy&quot; movies and would prefer to see something a little  more compelling then check out Boogie Boy. It's definately worth the time
dvd,,5.0,Howl's Moving Castle,"The outstanding graphics and animation are typical of any movie from Hayao Miyazaki. The story is entertaining, amusing and touching.  I highly recommend this movie which I feel is in the same class as Spirited Away and Totoro"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,My Daughter is Addicted to this movie.,"Bedknobs gets 5 stars because it's one of my daughter's favorites. It gets played over and over again. It's a simple magical story with silly songs. I don't quite understand why this movie is so special to daughter. She is autistic and one thing I know about her tastes is that she gets bored very easily with contrived, canned entertainment. If it comes from the heart, she really takes it to her heart. Maybe the ensemble that put together this movie had a lot of fun doing it and she picks up on that. She prefers it over Mary Poppins and much prefers it over Chitty-Chitty Bang Ban"

dvd,10 of 10,5.0,Superb documentary from award winning PBS show Frontline,"This is another superbly done documentary from the award winning PBS investigative journalism series Frontline (Peabody Award, Emmy and many more!). Disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-Walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation. He's obviously  smoking something, because this is made and hosted by Hedrick Smith, a PULITZER prize winning journalist who used to write for the NY Times. He is one of America's most respected journalists. I started watching the show since I was in high school (I'm now late 20's) and their shows are exceptionally high quality. Now, if Frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing Rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by Walmart, how is this pro-Walmart? "
dvd,,2.0,Against my better judgment,"I watched this with some trepidation, and I have to say it was both better and worse than I thought it would be.  It was better because it remained fairly true to the original, in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending.  It was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,great all time classic,"Runaway is a great classicly old film the robotics are dated but that is to be expected considering its made in 1984!, It still doesn't stop the fact its definately one for the collection?

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,The Discreet Charm of the UHB,"Made for almost nothing, Whit Stillman's lovely first film from 1990 demonstrates that the pleasures of film can lie in dialogue as well as in images in motion. Tom Townsend, a cynical Princetonian from the West Side, is persuaded to invest in renting a tux by a set of more privileged peers who want him to accompany them to debutante balls at glamorous faded hotels like the Plaza and the St. Regis, and then hang out until all hours in their deluxe East Side apartments afterwards. The film cuts costs as ingeniously as Tom by filming most of its scenes in these swanky living rooms (one of which was owned by the parents of one of the young actors). The film depicts a basically Fitzgeraldean vision of the young and wealthy, with the boys mostly romantic cynics and all the young women (except the idealized Audrey, the shy heroine who falls in love with Tom) more pragmatic and sexually adventurous. But Stillman's feel for this world seems very real, and his dialogue is very sprakiling and literate (the intellectual sources the young people cite--Fourier and Trilling--are charmingly anachronistic). The cast is excellent, although the standouts are Chris Eigemann, as the funny and trenchant Nick, and the gifted Carolyn Farina, who makes the timid Audrey seem deeply endearing."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"Gritty, no holds barred look at life on the streets...","It's surprising to me that more American cinema buffs have not seen ""Christiane F."". Directed by noted auteur Uli Edel who went on to direct the simarilarily themed ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"", ""Christiane F"" brings the working class teen world of 1970's Berlin vividly to life."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,My triplets love it!,"We have Right Brain and Left Brain. My triplets, who have very different personalities, liked Baby Einstein better when they were still in bouncers and crawling around. Now that they are toddlers at 22 mos, they've been enjoying Brainy Baby better. They still like Baby Einstein but since that only has music they just get the enjoyment of the pictures and music and such and the visual fun. With Brainy Baby, they are now learning because the narrator will say what's on the screen instead of just seeing it, so they are learning more now and understanding. For us, Baby Einstein is better for the infants, where Brainy Baby is better for the toddlers ages 1+ to start. But we love it! I didn't know they made more but now that I know I'm going to start buying the others! They love them"
dvd,18 of 20,4.0,Perfect!...almost,"Doctors recommend three 10-minute strength workouts a week, and this video provides just that. The workouts are challenging and thorough (addressing all muscle groups in the target area), without actually killing you. The stability ball is perfect for those who, like me, have a very sensitive back that can't handle Pilates or other mat exercises. The presentation is not hokey, fake, cheerleader, or in any other way insulting - just calmly assuring and relaxing. I am surprised and disappointed when the 10 minutes are up - but my muscles are relieved!"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great Movie,"This movie is top-notch hilarity, this is a must-own for Sandler fans or slapstick comedy fans. This movie is a classic in many ways and has a lot of firsts for later Sandler movies(like Rob Schnieder). A great movie, has almost non-stop laughs, I recommend it"
dvd,,4.0, THE ULTIMATE KYLIE ANTHOLOGY,"A fairly complete history of Kylie Ann's career. This DVD covers EVERY VIDEO that matters from her origin as an artist; the SAW years (Stock, Aiken and Waterman productions), the radio-pop years, the disco years and the ultimate smashing success of the ""Fever"" CD and it concludes with her most recent R&B/Soul music videos. It shows her entire evolution. From squeaky clean cutie to blazing hot seductress. As a bonus there is a nice live performance at the Brit Awards on here. I only wish there could have been more bonus footage, but all and all there's 30 videos on here and in pretty much chronological order. Accurate color, clear picture and digital stereophonic sound throughout. NOT TOO SHABBY an awesome value"

If you already own The Firm's Body Sculpting System 2 with fanny lifter and sculpting stick, then this DVD is worth the buy.  If you don't already own The Firm's BSS 2 and don't think you will buy it, then I would suggest searching for another abs workout DVD that won't require the additional equipment."

dvd,,4.0,"Good Concert overall, but Incomplete.","This DVD is a really good concert overall, but I think it's missing a lot of the essentials of the concert. Especially the Sgt. Pepper's triplets thing. How can you not put that on the DVD? And there was too many audience shots, only cameos of Paul and his band. I really hope Paul goes on another tour and creates a better DVD, with less audience and more him and his band. Still if you're a McCartney fan, or Beatles fan, I suggest you get it"

dvd,6 of 7,5.0,evolved comic some cool music and a good time.,"I was familiar with the series but didn't really get to fully enjoy this until recently.  We did a full on ""weekendfest"" and watched it all.  We were joking about how perhaps the music was subliminally charged with messages and that is why we couldn't stop watching it! Or was it the political and evil corporate zest? I am more prone to going for the fact that it was a unique artistic delight.  An evolved comic book meets drama meets sci-fi meets art and music hmmmm? Characters in this have enough depth to them you want to get to know them more. Raimi and Kamimura were delivered deliciously.  The tie in of the four superb.  I could go with the anti Saints haters and say it was loaded with politics and opinion of corporate evildoers but everything we watch is plugging some opinion or belief.  That is the Way. This too had its opinion but as in many brands of Art, it did so with beauty and seductively captivated your mind.  It entertains you. It was great artistically. Surreal fantastic and a very entertaining piece.  Watch it for the characters, the art, and the music, driven story line and be ""entertained"".  Or put your freedom fighter gear on and become a Broken Saint and go fight for your right to get entertained Majestically!!!!  For my comics lovers, its a tasty treat"
dvd,43 of 43,4.0,Great stories - shame about the U.S. editing,"David Suchet as Poirot is always a delight to watch, and I would love to recommend this DVD collection... but there is one major problem, at least as far as I am concerned. These versions were issued in the US and, I suspect, because of the ruthless hacking to accommodate commercials, these stories are each about 10 minutes shorter than the original U.K. versions. This is particularly damaging to Evil Under The Sun: In the edited-down version, characters inexplicably crop up and disappear and threads are left hanging. There is also a tendency to edit out scenes which are intended to exploit Poirot's little eccentricities which make the character so appealing. In the full version it all makes sense, with events unfolding as the director intended, rather than according to the dictates of the hacks who subsequently cannibalized it! If this irritates you even half as much as it assuredly does me, you might want to consider getting a region-free DVD player or a multi-format VCR (because this doesn't only happen with Poirot, but ALL films which cross the Atlantic), and then ordering British-made movies from amazon.co.uk, or any other reputable British supplier - you'll find it's well worth the trouble"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,an astounding vision,"This is an incredibly conceived animation. I'm intirgued by how it has been dubbed into english, there are lots of blank spaces in the dialogue and stillness in the image that I'm guessing might come from a more involved Japanese original. The effect is that sometimes the pace looses dynamism, All in all though its an astounding vision and what really mkes it is the depth of the surround sound track, alongside some really great drawing of course"

dvd,7 of 25,2.0,When will people learn that Kenneth Branagh sucks?,"I could talk about many things I hate about this movie.  Like for Desdemona, whose actring, poor command of English and thick French accent made me not very sad to see her die.  Or an insipid Emilia and wholey unmemorable Cassio.  Or the lack of chemistry between Desdemona and Othello; it was very difficult to tell that they were even a couple, much less so deeply in love."
dvd,6 of 10,5.0,Good Story and Cast,This is a good film about the Flying Tigers stationed in China. With John Wayne at the helm of the volunteers they dogfight their way to victory one plane at a time against the Japanese aggressors in W.W.II. before America entered the war. The film plays like a soap opera at times but good flying sequences and a script that explores the camaraderie of these men make the film very entertaining and rewarding
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Multi-layered film that demands serious consideration,"In Mamoru Oshii's outstanding Ghost in the Shell (1995), the director/writer gave himself little time, at less than 90 minutes, to explore the many questions he raised in that script.  With his long-awaited sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, he succeeds in answering many of these questions whilst at the same time giving us many more to ponder, in a film that, though flawed, deserves a 5 star rating."
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,Gilad is awesome!,"I used to work out with Gilad long ago when his show was on ESPN.  When I found myself in desperate need of losing weight, I turned to him again.  I never get tired of this workout - I have been using this video for about 3 years now, and I definitely credit this with my 85 pound weight loss.  You get a great workout - but it's not so challenging that you want to quit.  You can build on the workout as you become more fit.  Yes, the clothing is dated, but it gets the job done - cardio and ab workout, too!  "

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Miike--Master of Horror,"Imprint is an exquisite synthesis of beauty and horror. It will long imprint itself upon the viscera, eye, and psyche of the viewer. Disturbingly dark and rich atmospheric elements compel the viewer into a world in which few have or would ever wish to visit. It is no wonder that this was banned from U.S. cable. It touches upon and dances freely with virtually every taboo. Watching this film is like being mesmerized with an intricately decorated, velvet-covered sledge hammer. Don't plan on eating popcorn with this one."

Let's not forget that this is just a movie, and Tyler Perry has ingeniously used this medium in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Only someone with more of an open mind could appreciate that and know that there are some things you simply won't ""get"" not being African-American.  That doesn't mean everyone who's black will like this film -- but clearly by the majority of reviews on this web site, there's a reason this film rates so highly among us ""po, ignorant"" dark masses! :)  Tyler, keep doing what you're doing!

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"A disarmingly poignant, exceedingly human film","I can't help but believe that *Batteries Not Included would never have been made without the imprimatur of Steven Spielberg stamped upon it.  It's a wonderful film, but it couldn't have made for an easy pitch: we've got a group of disparate characters trying to save their run-down building from demolition by your basic big bad developer, and the miracle they all hope for comes in the form of these little alien gizmos - who not only go around fixing things, they also reproduce.  I just don't see a lot of Hollywood studio blowhards jumping up and down in excitement over such a wacky idea.  With Spielberg being Spielberg, though, the project was approved, and the end result is a film that delivers a rather amazing amount of heartfelt emotion.  "

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,One of the very best movies of its kind! Mind-blowing,"Having watched this movie several times, I have to say that it still has the same allure which it had when I first watched it 11 years ago. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action or character driven drama. This is, in my opinion, an all-time classic and a must-own movie -  ranking right up there with the likes of Casablanca, Tombstone or Saving Private Ryan. All of the characters in this movie are first-rate and pull the plot together superbly. The authenticity behind the all of the characters and the scenes is very impressive and adds a great deal of depth to the film. It boasts a fantastic balance between action and character development - with the extra time used to really get you involved with the characters and to see what is driving them as people. Some may say that this movie is too long, but it is time well-spent and can be appreciated by those who like to get involved with the characters and not just watch a storyline unfold. I really appreciate how the movie portrays both the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" - involving both of them in the story. This is truly an epic movie and deserves to be watched by anyone who appreciates a truly great movie. If you watch it once - you will want to see it again"

dvd,,2.0,"Beautiful and Unique, but oddly frustrating","Dancing on Dangerous Ground is best described as a ballet expressed through the medium of Irish dance.

It is a great learning tool that any teacher could use to show what the first responders were up against on 9/11/01. This historic event in American history is a lot like the ""Great Fire of 1835"" that occurred in New York City. Like the Fire of 1835, the fire was located in the same part of the city. Both events caused a huge major economic disaster. There was little or no water supply to fight both fires. History has a way of repeating itself.

He pressures her but to her knowledge he's been with many other girls. Including her two friends which includes Miriam Mcdondlad which stars on the hit tv show Degrassi.[..]. All of the girls that were with Nick have it but does this good little girl Hannah have it as well? I thought it was really great becuase it deals what teens go through. Pressure, sex, popularity, and trying to fit in. This was really great so buy it"
dvd,2 of 2,2.0,"Corny, predictable, contrived, and deceptive (in portraying New York.) I love it!","First, let me say that by quality film standards this is a terrible movie, in many respects. I live to walk on videos of this type with football cleats. But, this movie falls into the ""I hated this movie so much, I couldn't help but watch it whenever it was on"" category. And now I love it. I don't know what it is about this movie. I tried to put my finger on it many times. I always have and always will hate ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" which is a totally contrived load of crap. But ""You've Got Mail"" has an undefinable charm to it that forces you to look past it's simplified portrayal of a happy go lucky, skip around the neighborhoods of New York atmosphere. It makes you question why you buy into such sappy dialogue and situations. It's not just because of the Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry, because I hated the despicable ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and always thought the entire premis of ""Joe Versus the Volcanoe"" was a joke. But in this movie, contrived as it may be, that interplay between the two works. Though their acting is also hammy at best, I also love the contributions of Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Stephen Zahn and Jean Stapleton. This is one of my guiltiest pleasures. I'll only watch it with the remote on toggle to some type of sports programming in case my friends walk in on me while I'm watching it so I can jump inmmediately to the ""Binford Lumberjack Finals,"" or something like that. But were they to walk in at the end of this movie and find me glossy eyed with a lump in my throat, I'd never hear the end of it. I love this movie. There! I admit it."
dvd,,2.0,A Disappointing Sophmore Season,"Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.   The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, ""Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?""  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again."

dvd,11 of 11,4.0,Unexpected gem...,"When &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; was released eight years ago, I ended up watching it in the theater because I was bored and because it looked a little more promising than the rest of the pack. That thought proved to be an understatement. To date, I have seen this movie at least eight times, and I tend to enjoy it more with each viewing. Nicholas Cage is perfect as the disgruntled Secret Service agent who feels he has been banished to his current duty -- namely, doting on a cantankerous former First Lady, played to the hilt by Shirley MacLaine. &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; is alternately funny and moving, and even includes a bit of a mystery for Cage to solve. Far more than a one-dimensional film, &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; is satisfying for so many reasons -- the witty script, the fine performances, the deft direction, and the mostly even pacing, to name a few. While you can catch this on a regular basis on TBS (which has made the movie one of its most reliable staples), &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; is definitely worth owning for more frequent viewing"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Good movie,"Very thought provoking. The visuals were stunning and authentic, it truely is a masterpiece. However I thought the ending as a little lame :-P is there a reason why Douzi had to wait 11 years to do what he did?"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The movie that proves the point that every family is nuts to a degree...,"I have loved this movie since I was a kid. And it's funny when you're young, but when I watched it again as an adult, it's even more of a gem than I'd previously thought. The movie focuses on familial relationships and centers around Gil (Steve Martin) who is married with 4 kids and trying to work his way up the corporate ladder to provide for his family. It not only shows Gil's relationship with the family he's created for himself, but it also shows his relations with the family he comes from. His 2 sisters, one of whom is married to a man who insists on over-educating their 4-year-old daughter with flashcards of math questions most adults couldn't answer; the other is divorced and has a 17-year-old daughter that's involved in an overdramatic relationship with her boyfriend and young teen son who's quiet and seems to be hiding something. And then, there's their parents, who shower their deadbeat youngest brother with all the attention and glory. Everyone can appreciate some aspect of this film, as everyone has a family of their own. And everyone thinks their own family is the only one that's completely nuts and offkilter...until they see the underworkings of someone else's family and realize that no family is without its' faults. This is a wonderful movie that adults and kids of a reasonable age can enjoy. It's funny yet sweet and reminds us all that if our families don't kill us, they only make us stronger. Definitely recommend"
dvd,,4.0,I liked it more than other reviewers...,"because I found this to be a film with a great narrative.  There is a flow from beginning to end, a view of relationships of different kinds.  Some folks may be responding to the fact that there is no happy ending in this film, but there is no tragedy either.  Instead the viewer is given hints about life moving forward, thus an ability to project out over time.  The relationships are true to life, and the way that HIV is treated is the most realistic I have seen on film (it is just there, integrated, not a theme).  Personally, I was fine with the technical aspects of the film, feeling like the filming and light reflected the northwestern canadian setting."
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Similar story to Mean Girls,"When three popular girls in high school (Courtney, Marcy and Julie) kidnap their best friend Elizabeth Purr on her birthday (as an innocent and friendly prank), they accidentally kill her by gagging her with a jawbreaker.  Stunned, the three still went to school that day and pretend nothing is wrong.  After school, they carry her corpse to her house and make it seem like she was raped.  When Fern, the school nerd goes to Liz's house to drop off her homework, she finds Elizabeth dead in her bed.  To make Fern not tell (and to save Courtney's reputation from going down the drain), Courtney makes Fern ""one of them"", flawless and beautiful, and uses her to replace Liz."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,My little fluke,"By far one of my favorite movies when I was little, I was delighted to finally perch my DVD copy of ""Fluke"" in my movie library.  Ever since the lines began to echo in my head (""Well, he's MY little fluke""), I've known my purchase of the flick was imminent. It is, truly, a touching, poignant, and haunting film that tells of loss, betrayal, realization, and redemption on one side, and forgiveness, resilience, and pure, simple understanding on the other.  It is about learning to live your life, and learning to pick yourself up again.  It's told through the eyes of a dog, but it transcends that."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A star-making film for sure!,"I have not seen this Flashdance or any of Jennifer Beals' movies or the L-Word. I had to check this movie out because I had just worked with her recently on a low budget indie thriller, I won't give out the name out. Everyone told me that this is her best movie of her career. I think they might be right. I really enjoyed this movie, and the dance and music is fabulous. It's so '80s!, and Beals was at the top of her game. They could get Janet Jackson or Madonna to dance like that, but not act as good I don't think. I totally can relate to her role as a struggling artist having to work unlikeable job to pay the bills and trying to launch a career as a dancer. It's a very inspirational and entertaining film. A must-see for JB fans"

Just introduced this to the latest generation of our family. Tanks for the memories"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Outstanding Comedy: Fred Gwynne Shines!,"This is an outstanding and hilariously funny comedy. Vinny Gambini (Joe Pesci) is excellent as an out-of-place lawyer in the out-of-the-way state of Alabama; where he finds he is out-of-his-elements: Sort of. With his rough and saavy Brooklyn charm, he and Fred Gwynn as the conservative, no nonsense Alabama judge make this a terrific film! The court scenes with Fred Gwynn, and Maury Chaykin were hilarious. I found the film not only great, but the Oscar awarded to Marisa Tomei were well earned. It's a shame Fred Gwynne passed away not too long after the film. He was just starting to do some really good films. Especially after so many years of being typecast as Herman Munster, however, we should all be grateful that he did this film. It would not have been the same without him as the tough judge. I highly recommend this film. It's a great comedy. [Stars: 5+"
dvd,,5.0,Bloody Brilliant!,"If I am ever in desperate need of a good laugh, this is where I turn.

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Red Riding Hood and edgy Granny will appeal to everyone.,"This was one funny and clever kid's movies I have seen recently. My kids loved it instantly, and asked to watch it again. If there's one thing that annoys me, it's judging a book by its cover, or, in the case of a CGI film, by the CGI budget. There's been a lot of badmouthing the animation on Hoodwinked, even by people who say that the story more than makes up for it. Well, it's true enough that the CGI is low-quality; but that does NOT translate to bad CGI, because high-quality graphics was not what the movie was about."

When it was originally created, they shot the episode with two endings: The ""to be continued"" ending for the crossover, and then a self-contained ending for syndication purposes.

dvd,8 of 10,4.0,a fun family flick,"I don't know what that other guy is talking about. As far as LDS films go, this one is the funniest of the bunch, better than Singles Ward or RM, both of which I enjoyed. Michael B does a great job of capturing every sport-enthusiast-Mormon stereotype and pokes fun at all of the nightmare aspects of home teaching, from the last minute scheduling to the un-prepared-and-desperate spiritual thoughts. Although I've not tried entertaining my families with clogging demonstrations. Yes, the whole movie is over the top. But its hilarious because you'll see yourself or your home teacher is many of the situations. Its just good fun, folks. And I love the soundtrack, too. Can't get enough of those jazzed up and hip-ified primary tunes"

They could of did a ton more with the getting violent revenge in the first short, chief woodenhead, but it was funny nontheless.  The hitch-hiker in the third short is super funny with his ""THANKS FOR THE RIDE LADY!"" bit.  I think the writers of these series completely take advantage of the guilty mind and making sure those that have it coming ""get it"".  The second short ""the raft"" is partially dumb but you get a laugh watching each victim succumb to the oil slick. "

dvd,,5.0,It Takes A Brave Actress To Do A Show Like This! ,"I don't have Showtime at home, but had heard about this series, so took a chance and bought the DVD set. I've always liked Kirstie Alley, and after seeing this all-too-brief first season, appreciate her even more. Like another wonderful, mostly-improvised show, HBO's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, this one follows Alley's plight as she tries to rebuild a sagging (no pun intended) career and wrestle with her considerable weight problem. (How brilliant to create a character that is at once bigger than life and yet who suffers some of the same demons we all deal with.) Take note, also, of some of the camera angles that go out of the way to show Alley at her worst, and you appreciate how brave she was to do this comedy about her shortcomings. Add in some very funny situations and excellent ensemble support, and you have a show that will make you laugh out loud time and again. (In one episode, she starts dating an older billionaire who turns out to have a quirky, over-emotional personality. I laughed so hard at actor Bill Smitrovich's star turn as the billionaire that I think I hurt myself. In another equally funny episode, Wallace Shawn plays Dr. Sigmund von Oy, whose theories Alley embraces in an attempt to try anything that might remotely help her lose weight.) It seems that this first season and its seven episodes will probably be the extent of this show; once Alley's weight is fully off the show won't play particularly well. Meanwhile, we  have these seven in which a fifty-something actress fighting the pounds shows us the flip side of glamour, and makes us realize even the rich and famous suffer the same challenges we all do.  Highly recommended!       "

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Preminger's Daring Courtroom Drama,"It would seem that 1959's ANATOMY OF A MURDER was the first film to break the Hollywood ""production code"" in terms of using sexual terminology on screen.  Watching the movie makes one begin to understand how Hitchcock's PSYCHO happened a year later.  Otto Preminger (whose movie about drug abuse, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, had challenged the code in 1955) in ANATOMY OF A MURDER tells the story of lately unsuccessful bachelor lawyer Paul Biegler, who takes up the task of defending young Army Lieutenant Manion, who murdered his wife's rapist.  As Biegler, who though easygoing (he loves jazz) is no fool, James Stewart gives an intense performance.  The hard-boiled reporter of CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is there in his characterization, as is the Jefferson Smith (of MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON)-type idealist.  As Laura Manion, Lee Remick is perfect, providing just the right amount of ambiguity (did this ""voluptuous"" woman subtly lead her rapist on?  Is her marriage really so happy?) to make her character as fascinating as is Stewart's.  Likewise, Ben Gazzara's Manion is hardly a sympathetic convict:  he may have been justified in his crime, but he may also be a wife-beater.  Riveting performances are given by George C. Scott as the prosecuting attorney, Claude Dancer, and Murray Hamilton as a witness for the prosecution.  Just as his surname suggests, the big-city lawyer ""dances"" around the issues, rarely posing direct questions - yet he is so suave, dignified, and (at first) deferential in his manner that one scarcely notices how devious he is; his strength lies in this.  Hamilton stands out as the murder victim's friend, who tries to save his memory but who withers in the face of Biegler's merciless questions.  And this realist film contains two performances by non-actors:  McCarthy era attorney Joseph N. Welch is delightfully natural as the judge; Duke Ellington, who wrote the movie's score, has a cameo as Biegler's jazz musician pal.  Some may find Ellington's jazz score wrong for a small-town courtroom drama, but I think it appropriate on two counts.  First, it is motivated by the protagonist's love of jazz, and second, it fits the sophisticated nature of the film's subject matter.  To sum up:  both as a daring `50's movie and as a standard-setter in edge-of-your-seat courtroom drama, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is essential viewing.  "
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,"""I will not have them anywhere near me again."" Eric Hedford, Dandy Warhols drummer ","Enjoy the first three minutes of DiG; the fresh and invigorating treatment the credits get are the best part of the movie. During this film's next 30 minutes, you'll think that Anton Newcombe, (the brains behind the Brian Jonestown Massacre) is playing to the camera with a staged caricature of an egomaniacal wanker. Let me save you a little time; it's not an act. He is, in fact, a disturbed and abusive individual."

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Un documental extraordinario,"Estamos sin lugar a dudas frente a un documental excepcional. Pocas veces y de manera tan exquisita y erudita, se ha podido presentar una produccin acerca del rostro de Cristo en el arte universal con una calidad tan singular. No creo que haga falta agregar nada ms a lo dicho, sino solamente recomendarlo. Sin embargo, quisiera comentar, que en lo concerniente al barroco peruano, se presenta una ltima Cena en la que Cristo, rodeado de sus discpulos, tiene como centro de la mesa, una bandeja con un conejillo de indias o cuy, como le llamamos en el Per, hecho que obviamente captur el inters de los realizadores. Se trata de una expresin ms del color local que ti al barroco, durante los siglos XVII y XVIII, principalmente, en los pases iberoamericanos como el Per, y que es parte de lo que algunos sealan como sincretismo y otros prefieren llamar sntesis. En el documental se asevera que dicho cuadro est en el Convento de San Francisco de la ciudad del Cusco. Recuerdo haber recorrido dicho convento (solo una vez en el ao 2001), pero no recuerdo haber visto ese cuadro. Recuerdo, mas bien, otros de maestros tan importantes como Quispe Tito. A riesgo de equivocarme, podra decir que tal vez se trate del lienzo de Marcos Zapata, notabilsimo maestro indgena del siglo XVIII y que est colgado en la Catedral del Cusco. Si observan bien, aparte del conejillo de indias, como plato principal, observarn sobre la mesa dos fuentes complementarias. Una con mazorcas de choclo (o maz) del Valle Sagrado de los Incas. Otra en la que destacan ajes o pimientos picantes tpicos del Per, as como botellicas de aguardiente, interesante reminiscencia del autntico pisco del Per, y frutos dulces sobre la mesa, como la granadilla y, tambin, las chutas o panes redondos elaborados en la villa de Oropesa, asiento del marquesado que se halla al sur del Cusco y cuyo titular detentara el derecho a la sucesin del trono de los Incas en una hipottica restauracin monrquica. Otro de estos cuadros, se puede admirar en el Convento de San Francisco el Grande de Lima, con muy parecidos motivos y con el famoso conejillo de indias como plato principal sobre la mesa. El autor, si la memoria no me traiciona, fue el hermano De la Puente de orgen flamenco"
dvd,,4.0,"Finally, a family film"," A modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you, your grandmother or young child. The scenery was magnificent and the story, well, let's just enjoy it for the unoffensive entertainment. You rooted for the good guy, the bad guy got his ""come-uppance"" and no worries about language or nudity. Yes, of course, that is the norm today and you can see it anytime you wish and anyplace you go, so I was so pleased not to wince every five minutes. Go, get your popcorn, curl up on the couch perhaps weep a little weep. and enjoy a rarity today, (at least in my opinion,) a movies that lets you feel good when you're done. "
dvd,0 of 4,4.0,Good Movie,"I remember watching this movie a few years back. I thought it was decent overall. But my biggest question is if Jason hated the world so much, why didn't he blow himself up inside the gym"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Excellent Series, Well-Done DVD Set","Others have done a good job of reviewing the show concept --- so I'll just recap briefly. Based in part on the life experiences of a woman named Allison Dubois, this series features Patricia Arquette in an Emmy award-winning portrayal as a psychic-medium. As she comes to grips with her talents in this area, she helps the Phoenix district attorney with a variety of cases, but also wrestles complicated moral issues and deals with her at-home situation. She has three daughters and a husband who's an engineer, but is learning to accept the new complications that her work brings."
dvd,20 of 20,5.0,Romantic Magic,"It was the touch of finger tips, a hand on the waist, a longing look and a smile, and a graceful spin; it was Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, making love while they danced into our hearts and stayed there. It was elegance and charm, a romantic screen teaming like no other. Fred and Ginger gave the country a boost and a bit of hope in dire times, and made a collection of funny and romantically elegant dance musicals that have never been surpassed as film entertainment. There was magic when they danced, and charm when the talked to each other. "
dvd,2 of 6,5.0,Long Love,"I first saw this film in 7th grade when we studied Africa in social studies. Since my early teens I've been in love with Africa, and thus like the movie. I even like it better than the novel by Laurens Van Der Post."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful!!  Watch it twice or you are missing out!,"The first time I saw this movie in the theater, I remember liking it but being so sad at the end.  Nevertheless, as I love Drew and Adam, I bought it on DVD when it came out.  I couldn't believe how much I laughed!!  Now that I knew the ending, it wasn't so sad that I missed the rest of the movie.  There are so many clever scenes in this movie that I think people forget if they just watch it once.  When Drew attacks Rob Schneider with a bat!  When Adam jokes with his walrus and penguin!  When Adam apologizes to Drew for not being better looking!  I can go on and on. "
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,Heidi Fleiss Hollywood Madam,"I loved the intellectual twist to this documentary by British director Nick Broomfield! In an earlier review, escorts were mentioned, but Heidi was in no way connected to the escort business, although some of the  clients were the same. She did direct referrals, like Madam Alex"
dvd,,4.0,Classic - Peyton Place,"If you liked Peyton Place, you will love this movie.  Jeff Chandler does a great job portraying ""the publisher"" of Allison's book as well as her lover for the moment.  This also has a variety of things happening in Peyton Place that you will find interesting"
dvd,13 of 13,4.0,A great glimpse into Tibetan Buddhist beliefs.,"This DVD explores two different deaths occurring in Buddhist families: one death of an ancient man who had a rich, full life and one of a young, successful man struck down in the prime of his life.  It gives a great account of how Buddhists deal with grief in these two different situations.  It also interviews an ancient Buddhist monk about what he desires for the rest of his life, and an investigation of a young boy who might be the reincarnation of a great spiritual figure, and why people think the boy may be the man.  The narration by Leonard Cohen is stunning: I couldn't imagine a more appropriate voice and style.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is the relatively mediocre production values, but considering the remote location and the arduous environment, it's not surprising"

dvd,17 of 17,5.0,"A classic tale of adventure, true love, and REVENGE!","When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne... "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Enchanting adventure,I think every young child should see this wonderous film. I am 59 and want to see it again. It really humanizes milo and otis. The photography is fabulous
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,"An honest, and real biography","I'm glad I didn't let any negative review sway me from getting this disc. While the A&E biography is a ""feel good"" story of this legend, this disc is much more honest in it's portrayal of Johhny. They don't hide the fact that he had two sides, & W.C. Holland, & brother Tommy Cash recall with great detail what a fully human being the Man in Black really was. The narrator is fine, & the re-enactments are minimal, and needed to tell the types true stories that these wild boys went through. It doesn't take anything away from the story. The disc doesn't focus on his music so much (as there's no full songs presented), as on the man he was. That's ok; I have enough of John's music to compensate for that. I love the guy even more now then before. No sugar coating; just like Johnny would've wanted it."
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,I Want More McMillan & Wife,McMillan & Wife bring back memories of the good old days. At least they were for me.  By today's standards this kind of TV would be considered hokey.  But in 1971-1972 this was good clean TV with good plot lines.  Please release more of their episodes because I have already memorized the lines for the first six episodes
dvd,,4.0,"hilarious, for most of it anyway","the zuckers best career move was using leslie nielson in slap-stick comedies such as the airplanes and this series.this is a continuation of the hilarious,but unfortunately short-lived,tv show police squad.like airplane this is pur out slap-stick comedy,stupid yes but don't we all need some stupid comedy to make us ALL laugh.i would think it safe to say that if you don't find this funny than you don't have much of a sense of humor.so many scenes make me tear up with laughter,almost all due to the dead pan of nielson.it's great seeing oj tortured throughout,even having nielson sitting on his face.unfortunately as the movie nears it's end the laughs die down considerably,especially most of the whole baseball thing.but i have to give it the high rating that i have because as a comedy it does the job.when you're down and depressed and nothing's on the tv and you want alot of good laughs than pop this movie in every now and than and it should do the job.if this doesn't work,you need some serious help"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Sweet, funny feel-good gay romantic comedy","Other have correctly sung the praises of this delightful comedy that is both well-directed and well-written and has two adorable leads (Christian Campbell as Gabe and J.P. Pitoc as Mark). So, I'll focus on the absolutely powerhouse supporting actors. Clinton Leupp (aka Coco Peru) is sensational and literally steals the film with her two appearances (first lip syncing to a danced-up I AM WOMAN remix and then delivering a 7-minute monologue with only one cut in the scene--its a virtuoso comedic riff, perfectly delivered and ending with one of the film's best lines: ""It burns!""). Leupp later got a larger role (again as Coco) in the funniest movie of 2003--GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS). Tori Spelling is also a revelation as Gabe's neurotic galpal; she's wonderful in a hilariously bad musical number early on and she tops that with her diner meltdown later in the film. "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,You'll never make it as a successful artist today without seeing these DVDs,"Like i said in the title, these DVDs are essential to an up and coming artist. Being able to see how an artist works and thinks in the 20th century has changed the way i work and think. If you are an artist or an art historian and you havnt seen this series, then you need to. If you are an art professor, show this to you students  it will be one of the greatest things you ever do for their career"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great Popcorn flick,"This is a thoroughly entertaining movie that will keep you guessing. Kevin Spacey is perfect in this movie, and Benicio Del Torro and Gabriel Bryne do well in it too. The plot seems to be nothing out of the ordinary action/hiest/shoot-em-up movie plot that is found all to frequently in today's movie theaters, but the ending is what makes this movie a notable one. All great movies should have great endings, and this one does"
dvd,2 of 2,2.0,Interesting Script - Poor Acting,"Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the ""class divide"". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail? "
dvd,3 of 11,1.0,Too bad there isn't a 'no stars' option.,"DON'T BE FOOLED!!!!  The page states that David Lynch directed this, but he actually took his name off (look at the screen shot).  This extended edition was directed by Alan Smithee.  Don't worry though . . . it gets worse."
dvd,,5.0,"Same Band, lots of Maturity, Great Live DVD","""Alive at Red Rocks"", the latest DVD from Incubus, says a lot about the bands growth.  Past DVDs of theirs have often included silly backstage extravangandas, which is not a bad thing, but interestingly enough this DVD shows them very mature when backstage living the dream.  They now have a new bassist, and many of the songs they play live are from the most recent albums, but they definitely still can play live.  This DVD features a great concert, including rare versions of 'Drive' (played on piano by guitarist Mike Eizinger), and also a lot of backstage footage of the band and their personalities.  I highly recommend it"
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Jennifer Aniston saves the day....again!,"Along Came Polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely Jennifer Aniston makes this film almost worth while. I probably would have turned this movie off if it wasn't for her. Aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one, she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. Ben Stiller is another story, he always picks the same, stereotypical role. I guess Stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part. Oh well, Along Came Polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon. I recommend The Good Girl or Reality Bites instead"
dvd,,4.0,Almost perfect,"   This is a great set if you are interested in knowing Bret ""Hitman"" Hart the man.  However, the matches leave much to be desired.  It seems that Bret focused more on choosing matches that were sentimental to him as opposed to what would be most memorable to fans.  Overall, I would still recommend this set because it is a first rate documentary.  However, if you want more wrestling and less documentary, you might want to spring for the Undertaker DVD"
dvd,,5.0,My favorite things about this movie,"This movie kicks butt. Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely terrifying as Ace. That guy can act, no s**t. I totally forget I am watching an actor. He is so cruel that his presence hangs over the whole movie and meshes with the summery-yet-dark atmosphere that it gives it a great flavor. You just know they're going to meet him at the end the whole time, and that creates great suspense. Wil Wheaton pushes a line or two but does OK, he has a tough role. Much better than Wesley Crusher. "
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Stardust,"CAMP is a curious mixture of the good and the bad.  And when I say bad I mean thunderously awful.  The editing of some of the scenes, and the transitions between one scene and the next, are God awful.  We saw CAMP over the last few days and I'm still puzzled by some of the director's decisions.  I remember seeing his previous movie IN THE BEDROOM with Sissy Spacek and thinking wow, this is pretentious, and I'm glad to see he lightened up a bit with CAMP.  How serious could you be with that title anyhow?  The strange ""camp"" aspect of the movie was the plot in which little Fritzie, with her little eyes and bush of brown hair like the girl in WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, tries making herself invaluable to the popular Britney type girl Jill.  Fritzie's pretty creepy and after awhile, I started feeling sorry for Jill, even though she's unpleasant and unbelievably cruel, self centered, and sort of a big girl.  Plus, Jill proved herself talented enough to shine in the Bacharach-David number IT'S TURKEY LURKEY TIME, if I remember right the song that made Donna McKechnie a star."
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,Recommeded!!!,"It takes 9 hours to watch a complete set and it worths it. It interesting that my 6 years old daughter was watching some parts with me and we both enjoyed. There are a lot of reasons to watch the program. First, it gives a good overview of the western civilization from sumerians. Second, the quality of the material is superb. You'll see a lot of beautiful places around the globe. Third, you'll learn about the jews. "

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,One of the giants films of Federico !,"Fellini paid his personal tribute to Roma , and he memorialized himself for the first time ; this is simply one the most ravishing films in any age , filled with  bitter humor and incisive insights ."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,"Smart, Affecting","""Paradise Now"" is one of the first post-September 11 films on terrorism that I've seen and it's one of the most overlooked and powerful. Saying it's overlooked isn't completely accurate, it was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award and it won the Best Foreign Film Golden Globe. Most people won't see it though, because it's in Arabic with English subtitles. The movie is about two Palestinian men named Said (pronunced SI-EED) and Khaled, who see that their life is like a prison that they can't get out of. Both of these men long for paradise, whether it's real or just in their head. So the two men join a group of martyrs, have bombs strapped to their bodies, and begin crossing into Israel to commit a suicide mission in Tel Aviv. It's not so one-sided though, the movie kind of sidetracks...As soon as Said and Khaled cross into Israel, they are separated. Khaled gets back to the martyrs, while Said begins wandering around and realizes that the mission is his fate and he can't change it. The movie is pretty insightful at looking at the motivations of terrorism (like the critic John Anderson says on the cover, although I'm paraphrasing)...But, at the same time, I think that most terrorists don't think the way Said and Khaled do. The movie isn't likely to offend anyone that is offended by films like ""World Trade Center"" or ""United 93"" because it's about terrorism, but not the same kind as portrayed in those films (I haven't been offended by any film I've ever seen, so this is just an opinion). Even if you're not into reading subtitles, this is a haunting and important film that should be seen by people. This movie has the potential to be shown in classrooms at some point. In a world where politics can make you win Oscars and Grammys (Michael Moore, Rage Against the Machine, etc.)..."
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,This is great movie,I have seen the movie several times & I love it. It is in my top 15 movies.
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,van damme and lundgren make this worthwhile,"Universal Soldier is a pretty cool idea that is executed well, by taking dead soldiers of the military and bringing them back to life, specifically, the very muscular guys.  This is where Van Damme and Lundgren fill in, and we even get to see the massive Ralph Moeller several times (also played the villain Brakus in Best of the Best 2 and a fighter in Gladiator).  For the reborn soldiers, old Vietnam War memories resurface from the beginning of the film, and once again the Van Damme character becomes the good guy and the Lundgren character becomes the villain."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Hilarious Example Of How Deadly-Funny Dark Satire Can Be,"The bite to this movie comes from its near-perfect insight into what high school, overachievers, bored teachers, society, competitive people, politics, and marriages mired in ennui are all about. It's smart, it's incredibly funny, and it gets the most out of a very good cast. "
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Strange and sensuous,"'Marebito' is an interesting interesting concept film, original and well-made. A good 90 minutes of entertainment, if you like yours disturbing and gritty."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,REALLY GOOD,"My parents first bought this when it came out because they knew I loved star wars and this had aliens so they bought it. I loved it! It has some of the best actors, Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors, and Will Smith was great. This was probably Smith's first big movie, the biggest thing before that  was The fresh prince of Bel-air. The story is that there is an agency that protects the earth from aliens and things like that, well K ( Tommy Lee Jones) recruits J (Smith) and they have to find an alien that landed out in a farm. This alien is wearing an Edgar suit (one of the farmers skin) and it is trying to find ""the galaxy"" and is killing people on his way. Funny in parts, really good movie. Nothing like star wars but in a good way. I'm not sure if the 2nd is any good as I haven't seen it, but I heard it sucked so stick to the 1st"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"THE TURF IS REAL IN ""COLORS"".","Dennis Hopper presented an unseen vision of Americana with EASY RIDER in 1969.  It unsettled the masses.  He did the same almost 20 years later with COLORS, a frightfully realistic look at urban gang warfare in Los Angeles.  Hopper has always been a talent, both in front and behind the camera.  COLORS could only be handled by the likes of an independent spirit like Hopper:  It's tough, brutal, no watered down studio gloss, no techno effects.  Hopper is an actors director and Robert Duvall and Sean Penn are a perfect fit.  The oft told cop story of the veteran and the novice gets an injection of new life:  the partners don't like each other, they tolerate each other for the sake of survival. Duvall and Penn give strong expected performances and the story rifles along free of expected cliches.  Ice-T, in his rapper days (pre LAW & ORDER: SVU) is featured on the soundtrack. "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Absolutely Brilliant,"I was always a big fan of the original movie, starring Zero Mostel.  This new musical adaptation is utterly brilliant and, as far as I'm concerned, worthy of Oscar nomination for Best Picture.  Mel Brooks may well be the most underrated director on the planet"
dvd,22 of 23,4.0,Love is never Easy...   Just some info on the DVD,"This is a delightful romantic comedy with a very engaging main actress (Marguerite Moreau). After spending years as a ""jerk magnet"", she is about to quit the dating scene when lo and behold, two decent guys with real potential come along. Like they say, ""it never rains but it pours"". She is then faced with the opposite problem of deciding which guy would be the better choice. While watching it, I didn't really know how things would turn out because both guys she was into were actually quite likeable. Fortunately everything ends happily. Well it is a romantic comedy. :)"
dvd,,5.0,One of my altime favorite films,"When this movie came out I was 4 and my dad rented it. The Only part of this movie I remember then was Judge Doom scaring the boo boo Gebies out of me. Now that I'm 20 I've seen it 20,000 times. This is one of the most funniest and creative movies I've seen ever. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd give great Performances. And Roger Rabbit is one of the funnest characters on the movie (He sort of reminds me of an early Bugs Bunny) You get the occasional guest spots from some of the best cartoon characters. Donald Duck and Daffy Duck fighting each other just to show off who's better (Favorite Scene). Betty Boop, Dumbo, Yosemite Sam, Droopy, Mickey and Bugs share a scene (A first with these 2 legends.) Also this is one of the last perfomances of Mel Blanc (The voices of the Looney Tunes). The Movie is very high tech for it's time. This is one of the most funniest and greatest movies of all time. Some of the language is kinda bad for kids but not too bad so parents get this movie. I love this movie."
dvd,,4.0,"Good video, could be a bit longer","This DVD features Slayer performing Reign in Blood in its entirety, so if you enjoy that release (and who doesn't?) and seeing Slayer play live then there's no reason why this shouldn't appeal to you. Not only does Slayer play all of Reign in Blood, they also have a raining blood effect at the end of the song Raining Blood, which is a gimmick, but a pretty awesome one to be honest. The extra features include Slayer performing six other songs and a short documentary about Slayer. "
dvd,2 of 9,1.0,Horrible,"Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more ""Dumb and Dumber"" than ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". Awful"
dvd,2 of 18,2.0,Bad porn,"The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be ""artistic"" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed."
dvd,1 of 4,2.0,You too Jeff Gold-steen.,"Now I'm usually one what finds anything old Bob and David have to offer as funnier than a clown holdin' a bag of farts, but ""Run Ronnie Run"" is not on par with previous Mr. show offerings.  For those of you who are fans of Mr. Show and the original Ronnie skit, you aren't gonna find much new here.  Pretty much a rehashing of that same skit, which plays (the skit) hilarious for the ten or so minutes it was on, but not enough material to develop into a feature length film worthy of Bob and David's talents.  Granted it is pretty fun to watch with other friends who are familiar with the show, but the laughs get spread pretty thin.  I subconsciously hoped that the movie would somehow segway at certain points to another skit, as Mr. Show did so brilliantly over its 4 seasons.  The movie's worth a view for you die-hard Mr. Show fans, but can't say I'd add it to my collection. Keep 'em coming Gleep-Glop"

dvd,5 of 7,5.0,One of the best!,"'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.  Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may.  I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.  Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original)  Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look.  Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill).  Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned.  The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.  One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.  This is the film to beat"
dvd,,5.0,"Fun for the whole family, parents included!","If you think you can't handle another minute of Elmo, perhaps it's time to introduce your kids to The Muppet Show collection. Even if you didn't watch the show as a youngster, you will probably appreciate the show's roster of guest stars, including Candice Bergen, Sandy Duncan, Florence Henderson, and other luminaries you may have forgotten--not to mention the show's smart, funny, and child-appropriate variety show sketches. Above all, it will remind you of Sesame Street's best years--before it was dumbed down by that irritating red character who refers to himself in the third person. (What IS that about anyway?) The Muppet Show Collection features Kermit and other beloved characters--plus the indomitable Miss Piggy! I recently showed the a couple of episides to my three year-old daughter and she thought Miss P was hilarious--and what child would wouldn't? She was a cultural icon! A great gift that seems a more worthwhile than most of the newer kid's shows on dvd"

I am 33 years old, and I felt that this film was cheesy, stupid, not scary at all with no originality and I loved every minute of it!!  Yes I did, and here is why??The film was a comic book, a monster movie that didnt take itself seriously at all.  The whole tone of the film lends to that.  I never thought id give this piece of trash 5 stars, but the fact that everyone involved just went for the cheesy factor and knew it......It's a fun film if you go in thinkin cheesy comic because that is exactly what it is.  I loved it opening day and still love it now.  The final fight at the end between these 2 juggernauts is fantastic!  Check this out for cheap cheesy thrills!!!!!! Youll love it"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The greatest show in the history of TV. Period.,"The first season of ""The Sopranos"", by itself, is one of the landmarks in television history. Told from the point of view of Tony Soprano, at first a high-level capo and then eventually street boss of the DiMeo crime family in New Jersey, it is very different from everything else in the medium in a number of ways - shot and lit like a film; superbly written with a gift for deftly alternating  between shocking violence, drama and humor; complex plotting that often stretches over multiple episodes or even seasons; fully formed characterizations of even the most minor characters; imppeccable use of music and pop culture to establish mood, authenticity, and draw you in; and each performance is an acting tour de force. The attention to detail that permeates every frame of these first thirteen hours is astounding - a single glance, or movement, or word of dialogue; these can reveal enormous truths about each character. The first season focuses on Tony's emotional state; we understand the pressure of his job but also the relatively mundane pressures that he feels with his kith and kin in everyday life, and his inability to cope physically manifests itself in panic attacks which lead him to therapy - a choice that almost gets him killed, but ultimately proves useful to alleviating his problem at least temporarily (while also brilliantly allowing David Chase to provide self-analysis throughout the series). Here are brief capsules of the first thirteen astonishing episodes:"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Flawless,"I was hesitant to start collecting Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex because I had watched the first 8 episodes and was not totally convinced to buy it.

This is quite possibly the best series of anything, ever. And this disc proves it"

A late night phone call to Sam Spade tells of Archer's murder. Spade visits the scene, then returns home. The police show up to tell him Thursby was also killed. Archer's widow shows up to see Space about the death, another complication. Miss Wonderly calls to see Spade and tells him a little more truth. Spade agrees to help her, but he needs more money. Back at the office Joel Cairo visits to offer a reward for providing a statuette of a black bird."

dvd,,5.0,Almost as hilarious as your face!,"Grandma's Boy was recommended to me by a friend who said, ""If you've ever played video games and smoked marijuana, then you need to see this.""  I should have seen this movie a long time ago!  Nick Swardson and the others are geniuses.  It's the funniest Happy Madison movie ever and probably the best ""party"" movie I've seen since Friday.  All the characters are so funny.  The jokes are hilarious.  After watching this movie I was so wired from all the laughing I did.  Seriously...SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  It's rude, crude and freakin' sweet"
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,just plain funny,There is nothing else that you could ask for from a comedy movie that you dont get from this movie. It is the very highth of comedy.
dvd,,4.0,"More action than plot, and that's a good thing.","Somewhere in this movie, there is supposed to be a romantic subplot. Well, McQueen wanted to make a movie that showed all the grit of LeMans for the entire race, and in my estimate, he won out over the studios. The action is in-your-face, and shows just what goes into this sort of racing. Thankfully, the love story subplot is mostly lost, making for a pleasant viewing experience for the racing enthusiast"
dvd,,5.0,Awesome,I ordered this DVD after going to one of their shows. It is fantastic! It contains most of the major portions of the show and a few bits of extra. Highly Recommend
dvd,7 of 10,5.0,A Wake Up Call,"This is an extremely disturbing but essential movie for any free-thinker or anyone who is disturbed by the current religious right wing.  A ""hell house"" is an extremely clever form of brainwashing teens and stifling dissent. The documentary carefully focusses on how a real horror show is created for Halloween but unlike the usual scary and mindless fun is a full blown sermon that disguises itself as entertainment. The most frightening part of the whole concept of the ""Hellhouse"" is the hatred behind it. The scenario where a teenager is dying of AIDS and another is dying from taking RU-486 while someone dressed as the devil is laughing is sickening as is the re-enaction of Columbine where the teen character being mocked and obviously losing it is portrayed as ""succumbing to Satan"". Some parts of this movie are amusing, in a John Waters-ish kind of way. If these people weren't deadly serious about this quasi-indoctrination, I could pass it off as a laugh.  And the kids who interrupt them and demanding answers are not ""ranters"".  They chose to spoke out. So should anyone who, like the film makers (who let the people speak for themselves, rather than commenting on their own) believes that our young people have the right to make up their own mind about their sexuality, have the right to choose and seek treatment for their mental health issues, rather than believing that they are ""living a life of sin"""

dvd,8 of 8,5.0,"Prince, the aladdin's genius is out of the lamp!!!!","One of these days I was in a big music store in my town and this video was rolling on a big plasma screen. Immediatly it took my attention and in a few minutes I've been completly hooked. i searched for it but it was sold out. Finally after a couple of weeks the store reassorted it and put it even at a lower price so I immediatly decided to get it. Men. Yesterday's late night I was in bed but I decided to give this dvd few moments. Oh men. This is one of the greatest concert ever in my opinion, one of the most entertaining for sure. After the first bars I immediatly started to dance in bed! This band the man put together is sublime, it is stellar, it's groove is so tight it's incredible. Oh men! What a funk! This band is incredibly grooving! Fantastic rhythmn team. Great great great! The program has its variety, it has a spectacular tune with Nikka Costa (very good girl!!! ) a lot of Jazz here and there with fantastic soloists (Maceo Parker and the other horn guys, sorry can't remember the names now,... great piano player) and a killer funky soul allaround. I can't do nothing but suggest the purchase of this live concert. I will buy each and every DVD Prince will publish in the future if they will be similar to this one. You will hear Hendrix, James Brown, George Benson, Charlie Parker, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett's echoes (and more than echoes) in this music. Generations of black music in just one band!! Incredible band (telle the bass player Rhonda that I LOVE HER and I WANT TO MARRY HER!!! =)))) ), incredible performance and incredible music!!! I REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS DVD  !!!!! Prince is the real Aladdin's genius came out of the lamp!!! 5 stars are not enough!"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"Monsters from the subconscious...of course, that's what Jack meant","This is a historically important film in both the SF genre and in film itself.

However ""The Searchers"" is often said to be the Duke's best movie. And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still ""The Searchers"" is a classic and deserves to be better known."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"""I Want You To Tell All Your Friends About Me, I'm Batman""              ","Director Tim Burton absorbed all the important lessons to be learned from the four Superman movies and added his own unique (some might say warped) vision to 'Batman', successfully moving the motion picture superhero genre to the next level. While the Superman series fiercely clung to a high degree of light-hearted comedy throughout, 'Batman' presented a dark, grim world for Bruce Wayne to defend. While the villianous Joker (Jack Nickelson) was a comedic villian in his own right his was a more modern up-to-date black comedy that caused one to both laugh and cringe at the same time."

dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Shamefully BAD,"This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet"

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,This is Rodney.,"This set is rodney through the 80's and 90's. I've seen Rodney in person more times than I can count. I worked as a body guard at Westbury for years and met the man many times. This set is a mix of his work. His one liners made him who he was, but you do here the same lines over and over. "

dvd,5 of 6,1.0,The worst movie ever made.,"This movie has got to be the worst I have ever seen. Garfield written by Jim Davis is a wonderful comic with lots of clever humor. Garfield is my favorite comic of all time. but this movie was nothing like the comic at all. Even Jaws: The Revenge and Batman and Robin can entertain me when I'm really bored. This movie I felt like I was trapped threw the whole thing. Before this movie I believed that every movie could be slightly entertaining, nd then I saw this. If you're a fan of the comicdon't see this movie. Its not Garfield its just a bunch of characters with the same names, that don't act at all like there comic counter parts. I think if I could rate this movie any number I would rate it -10. Its just that bad. Do not by this movie. In fact don't even rent it you aren't missing anything if you don't see it. My final word is that if you want to see the real Garfield just read the comics"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,"a must, despite the pallid commentary","This is a film I'd only caught TV fragments of, decades ago.  I'd watched enough back then to know I wanted to add it to my home collection, but I held off buying the videotape version because the video was available at an outrageously high price.  I've come to appreciate the voiceover commentaries Fox provides on many of its re-releases so, when Fox announced it was making a reasonably priced DVD of it available, I pre-ordered it a month before its release.  The movie itself is excellent in every respect.  The commentary, though, is not up to the usual Fox standards."
dvd,,5.0,Great Movie Musical,"The Amazon review by Tom Keogh is totally ridiculous. ""Charmless and dull???"" I saw this movie about 8 times when it came out when I was little and was loved it so much.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it now"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Roger Dodger - I likey,"Young teenager comes to NYC and learns the way of the woman from his rebel advertising exec. uncle. Hasn't this happened to everyone? We're young and awkward around women -- just can't seem to get the words out -- hopeless. But wait, we go to visit colleges and ironically come home with the education that really matters, the one you can't learn in class. It's a cool premise and it plays out nicely. This indie feature is well shot, fast paced, and written like a swiss watch. Well cast and a great story. If only it were real"
dvd,2 of 11,2.0,"Clearly no where near as good as ""Suspiria""!!","Like many of you Argento fans, I had heard a lot about ""Deep Red"" and some people even considered it to be Argento's best work.  So, I just had to buy it.  However, after viewing the movie, I respectfully disagree with the opinion about ""Deep Red"" being Argento's best work.  While it is true that ""Deep Red"" is a bit more coherent with regard to plot development, the movie's atmosphere is no where near as effective as Argento's superior work in his true masterpiece named ""Suspiria""."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Fun underground flick,"I've heard either two things about this movie: it's stinks or it's really good.  I will go with the latter.  This low budget vampire movie doesn't look that low budget.  The special effects are okay but the style of the movie itself looks very professional.  It was surprising to see Fred Norris from &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; pop up towards then end.  He, too, was also very good.  The other review summed it up pretty well so I won't do that again.  The only compliant I have is not about the actual movie but the product.  Whoever created the silly hologram cover shortchanged the film by only showing Amy Jo Johnson (she is only in about half the movie).  It's also just a little cheesy.  Video box aside, this was a great purchase"

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Dreamtime in America,"It is so rare to see a film that is both brilliant and you can watch it with your kids.  After we watched the last of the titles scroll by, just sitting there amazed, my daughters and I found ourselves talking about life in way we never had before.  This film will open your heart and feed your mind as you get caught up in a children's circus fantasy land that resolves some very grown up issues for two wonderful children (and for once the issues aren't about sex or abuse - what a miracle!).  Acting, directing and cinematography are A list.  A must see film. "
dvd,,5.0,A triumphant comeback for Kurosawa,"The mortally wounded Lord Shingen (Tatsuya Nakadai), engaged in strife with two opposing warlords for control of feudal Japan, commands that his death be kept a secret for three years in order to prevent both disarray among his clan and conquest by his enemies.  Upon his death, his kagemusha, or double (Nakadai again)--a lowly thief with a startling resemblance to the lord--takes over under the strict supervision of Shingen's closest associates.  "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,HOUSE OF CARDS,"I found it amazing that this set has not been brought more obviously to the attention of the American viewing public, at least those of the PBS ilk. I only found it thanks to a recommenation by Netflix (which alone makes that service worthwhile).  The HOC trilogy is about a ruthless MP who manipulates the system that he is supposed to serve towards his own ends, to say nothing of the people around him. The trilogy happens to play out in decending order in terms of excellence of the script, the first being easily the best. The bite of the satire is sharpened by the device of having Francis Urquet break through the fourth wall to address the audience, often in front of other characters. Face-framing close-ups are used which accentuates the man's menace. And it works because its so bleakly funny and black. Proof that political cynicism as part and parcel of govenment was fully in flower a long time ago"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,48 People Can't Be Wrong,"Perfection.  Absolute perfection.  But before you go away, let me say ... when I wrote this review, there were 48 existing reviews, and I noticed something interesting.  Looking through the archive, I found two of the most shocking sentences on any Amazon item review page, especially one with 50 reviews:"
dvd,3 of 11,4.0,a pretentiously dramatized yet sad story,"this is a sad story about all the low lives in new orlean. the setting of this movie itself does not look far from a staged play. characters also exaggerated like what we used to see on the stage, but all the castings were good, performed well. lost souls, bullies, wimps, psychos, all the possible low lives you could find in the back streets of a hot, humid, rundown red neck neighborhood. lota of scenes and dialogue are nothing but pretentiously exaggerated and staged, bearable to hang on to keep watching along with the good performances almost all the characters. if you could treat it a play and look at it as play, it's a good one. but if you know how to separate it from a play, watching it as a movie should be, then it's not great at all."
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,ANOTHER TOSHIRO MIFUNE CLASSIC ,"This is a really great movie. And another one of the many, many great movies by the late Toshiro Mifune. It is both a comedy and an action movie rolled into one. Enough has already been written by so many reviewers about this movie that I don't think I could add any more but to say that this belongs in every cinema collection. Thank goodness it is part of the Criterion collection. Kurosawa definetly had a sense of humor when he made this movie. With Mifune selling his services to both of the warring clans, you know there's going to be hell to pay. This film never disappoints the viewer, and after years of repeated viewing, it never disappoints me. Highly recommended"
dvd,,5.0,The Best Series I have Ever Seen!,"I love this series, period. Im one of those people who not only like action, but likes something that makes you think. This not only makes you think, but gets you thinking about your own existance. Hideaki Anno is one of the greatest dirctors of all time. The way he turns his visions into cinema is unmatched by anyone else. And to think I used to dispise this show on Adult Swim. Its too deep to jump in in the middle of the series let alone not having the ability to rewind if you miss something. It must be viewed in a complete set to be truly understood. You wont regret this purchase"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,An Amazing Movie,"It is sad that this movie didn't receive much promotion when it was released in the USA. It is superb. In fact, as a person who has watched hundreds if not thousands of movies, it is now rare for me to be truly impressed with a new movie, even good ones. This movie impressed me--made an impression on me deeply. I watched it three times within 24 hours--something I never do."

dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Truly sad,"...how dumb movies can get. Then again, maybe I was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film. Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life. Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from? Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness. Not recommende"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,"""All The Power Of Rome!""  ~  At What Cost Freedom?","Who among us could ever forget one of the greatest moments in cinematic history. There on the surrounding hillside sit six thousand warriors awaiting punishment from their Roman captors.  Beaten in battle, but not defeated in purpose and belief they will not submit to the will of Rome. Unwilling to obey the command of Marcus Crassus and identify there leader Spartacus they stand up one by one proclaiming their defiance with the shout, ""I'M SPARTACUS!"" Soon the entire hillside is shouting the refrain full well knowing that by doing so they have willingly condemned themselves to die on the cross. If that doesn't give you goose bumps nothing will."
dvd,,5.0,Really changed my views.,"Excellent Film! I was already a little environmentally conscious before, but after watching this documentary I feel embarrassed that this man, Al Gore as I'm sure a few others as well have taken the time and dedication to put forth this knowledge to us.

But for the most part ""The Princess Bride"", is actually fun for both boys and girls, and for viewers of all ages."
dvd,,5.0,A moving tribute,"On 9/11, captured on camera was one of America's defining moments. Purely by chance were these moving images caught.

dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Surface Charm Masks a Cold Heart,"I first saw this movie in the sixties, when its expose of Rome's decadent jet set still had some shock value.  Four decades later, when the mating habits of movie stars are endlessly dissected across the globe, the trials and tribulations of the sweet life feel numbingly familiar."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Have a House party!,"A great 80s horror/comedy that's perfect for a Halloween party with friends, House combines creepy thrills with sardonic wit to create a unique genre blend."
dvd,,5.0,Highly Recommended! Six Hours Well Spent,The other reviews have summed up nicely how moving and engaging this film is. In this day and age of predictable cinematic crap a jewel like this really stands out. Funny how after six hours I was disappointed that it had to end. 5 stars A
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A great source for Human Development video clips,"This series of ""to walk,"" ""to think,"" and ""to talk"" is a great resource for child/human development.  It portrays current research in a brief yet engaging manner.  I use it in my Human Development course and students consistently find it helpful, informative, and interesting in demonstrating concepts and research that we're covering.  The second series of ""to feel,"" ""to belong,"" and ""to relate"" is also a great one. "

dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Needs a &lt;&lt;&lt; S P E C I A L  E D I T I O N >>>,"There are so many memorable scenes and performances, it's a travesty it hasn't seen a deluxe edition on dvd. It did get a respectable treatment from Criterion on laserdisc years ago, but nothing for today's audiences. Some of my favorite moments include the very opening when O-Dog lets the mom-and-pop grocers have it for being racist (and his reaction to watching the old man's head get blown off while watching the security video later in the film); the flashback featuring SAMUEL L. JACKSON (one of the greatest actors of our time), when he's at the table playing cards when the guy across from him gives Tat some attitude. The dialogue in the exchange is classic, amidst the smoke and dark haze. After Tat wastes him with several shots to the chest, he turns on another man seated and shouts ""YOU OWE ME SOME MONEY, MOTHERF_____R??"". The problem with the current dvd (aside from it being bare-bones on supplements) is that it is the R-rated cut. The better, more graphically violent, unrated edition is superior - unfortunately it only exists on the Criterion laserdisc. SPECIAL EDITION - UNRATED, DELUXE - NOW"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A Very Pleasant Experience,"We were unfamiliar with virtually all of the cast except for Maggie Smith, and kind of felt like we were throwing the dice.

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Not a Hollywood Gem, But Lasting Messages","If for nothing else, this film has one of the most memorable lines that you will ever hear in a movie.  Bullworth is being interviewed and he comes up with a plan for ""racial deconstruction"".  You can read it in full on the imdb website as the language is coarse."
dvd,4 of 5,1.0,Appauling Quality,"This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to ""Angel heart""). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo ""Delta"" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term ""special edition"" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series)."

dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Overall a really good workout... but...  ,I think this is a wonderful workout.  It works absolutely every area of the body so you get the benefit of a complete workout.  The only problem I had with the video is that there isn't a section in the beginning describing the movements they're going to use.  I tried doing the workouts along the first time I put the video in and couldn't keep up b/c I didn't know which movements they were going to do next.  I ended up sitting down and just watching the whole thing once all the way through so I knew what to expect the next time around and that was a big help.  The second time was much better.  It really is a powerful workout and I'm already seeing benefits from it.  :-

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,A nostalgia trip for any child of the 80's.,"Ahhh... The early 1980's. Reagan was president, new wave dominated the radiowaves and MTV actually played MUSIC VIDEOS! Ask anyone who grew up during this period what their favorite non-animated show was as a kid and they'll probably say ""Knight Rider."" KR, as its affectionately called by some fans, may seem quirky and obscure nowadays with its atari centipede sound effects, poofie aqua-net hairdo's, over-acting and ""sooo not the original artist"" song usage, but we didn't care...

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,One More Time!,"Beautiful music, exception voice, palpable and liquid color, and an orgy of conservative values - not really a bad thing when carried off by some of the most lush scenery in Austria, very broadly painted heros versus woodenly vile baaaad guys, and sugary but not cloying good people.  I remember seeing this when I was about twelve years old, easily pleased by the story then; I am even more impressed by the ability of this film to be meaningful when I am now nudjing retirement.  Julie is still winsome, the children are still able to come across as real.  The Sound of Music was, is, and hopefully always will be a treat for the eyes, and respite for the soul........"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Best Kung Fu flick, hands down...","Well, let's see: Yuen Woo Ping, Jet Li regulating, very little ""Wire-Fu"", an actual good story... just a few reasons this movie is one of my favs. If you are a martial arts movie lover then this is a must see.  This movie takes no time to get going with end to end fight scenes that will have you going ""Oooh!"", ""Ohhh snap!"", ""Oww! That had to hurt!"" and... umm... you get the idea. The English dubbing isn't nearly as bad as other movies I've seen, and other reviewers have stated, so don't sweat that unless you are really picky about that sort of thing - the dubbing didn't bother me at all on this movie. Bottom line: This is THE movie to watch for Kung Fu fight scenes"

This was truly a milestone in family entertainment, a program that pleased young and old alike.  I had forgotten many of the eary episodes and was thrilled to see Juliet Prowse, Joel Grey, Connie Stevens and others singing and dancing with the Muppet Gang.  While Kermit ruled this plush mob, Miss Piggy quickly stole the show with her solo performance on ""Temptation.""  Later, in episode two, Miss Piggy takes amusing offense to Kermit's interest in Lydia, the tattooed lady. You can go to Kermitage to get a rundown on all the episodes.  "

dvd,19 of 21,5.0,Perhaps the last game before football went corporate,"The ice bowl is the first football game I have clear memory of. This tape,which is very well done, sets s up the game by showing what happened the year before in the championship game in Dallas,and how the Cowboys were ready to avenge that loss. Also, juxtaposed nicely, are the story of the 1967 packers, in the final year of their glory under Vince Lombardi. The tape brings the voice of Ray Scott,longtime voice of the packers and the NFL before the corporate suits took over the broadcast booth with ex jocks. The the game itself is shown virtually in its entirity, with clever voiceover by Scott sounding very much .like it did that day. With the temperature being -16 below zero, the players and fans literally were trying to survive as well as win. This is the best of the NFL tapes that I have seen,perhaps because of the seminal importance of the game,or simply for nostalgic reasons. Either way, this is an excellent tape and a good bargain,considering that you are likely to re-watch a sports tape. And, listening to the voice of the great Ray Scott is a distinct pleasure"

She has just been sick alot since birth and has developed a real fear of doctors since multiple visits to the ER.  We got this video hoping to relieve some of her fears.  Right from the first time we watched it she loved it.  We watched it about once a day for a month straight.  She loves the songs and sings along.  Her favorite is the ""patient"" song.  We bought her a doctor kit in addition and her next visits to the doctor were a breeze!  It is a great video and really teaches kids alot.

dvd,0 of 3,2.0,Middle road taken,"I did not enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would.  They left out alot of the parts in the book where your mind could just picture it so clear and vivid.  I did this as a read aloud, slightly modified with my students.  I was really excited when I found a movie to go with it, and showed the class it.  It's rated PG, which for the material of the book is really a clue as to them leaving out alot of stuff.  My class enjoyed most of the book and felt the movie didn't do it justice.  I agree"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The Curse of Quixote,"There have been many films made that have never been released. There have been many films that started to get made, but that were forced to shut done for one reason or another.  However, until LOST IN LA MANCHA there had never been a film about the unmaking and unraveling of a movie."
dvd,1 of 1,1.0, I wish I could give this film no stars,"This is simply the worst animated film I have ever seen in my entire life,there is nothing to warrant even one star.This film is nothing but a mess of wooden characters, bad animation,and a poorly conceived plot. This film could have been good in the right hands,namely Ralph Bakshi's hands.The studio executives changed the entire film without Bakshi's knowledge and the final result was this animated abortion. The film started good at the begining, Frank Harris being sucked into the ""Cool World"" and eventually a detective there and that's were the qaulity ends. The film goes back and forth between the cartoonist Jack Deebs in the real world,who is given no detail, and the poorly animated and un-funny ""Cool World"". Then all of sudden at the finale, Jack Deebs is given a massive dose of character development at the very last minute and actaully ends up being the hero. Yes,this is film is actually that sloppy.I think I need to alert the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, they have obviously overlooked ""Cool World"" as a great form of torture"

dvd,,5.0,Realistic Recovery,A stunning portrayal of the disease of alcoholism. The story revolves around an AA meeting in the basement of a church. Richard Lewis stars as a member on the verge of relapse. The stories told in the meeting are typical of the reality of addiction.

dvd,,4.0,Great DVD Set,Thanks for the great Laguna Beach DVD Set. I really enjoy watching it over and over again
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Go to the toilet before you see this,"This is one of the most amazing thrillers I've ever seen.  I love a good thriller and this is by far one of the best.  It is well acted, and gets you within the first 10 -15 minutes.  Once it has you, it doesn't let up for the entire length thereafter.  I love Kurt Russell and he's so good in this (He was also good in Unlawful Entry which was another fantastic thriller).  The only trouble I have with this, is that it's always on TV right before I'm about to do a drive from LA to Vegas and it's all too close for comfort.  J T Walsh was also great in this.  He was pure evil but also really convincing.  You have to see this movie.  I know that is a cliche but this is true.  This is such a great thriller, so all thriller fans watch this now if you haven't already seen it, but just make sure that you go for a pee first"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Entertainment Maximus,"The series was extremely well done and provided a well-scripted dramatization of Caesar's struggle for Rome.  Cast was outstanding and the costumes, scenes, and overall production quality was very high.  There has to be praise for HBO's taking an historical topic and translating it into a 12-hour series.  The only reason I didn't give five stars for this was because a couple of the episodes lacked the ""punch"" that I expected from each, particularly following the first two episodes"
dvd,,1.0,THIS MOVIE IS HELL ON EARTH...,"This is not one of Adam Sandler's better films. In fact, it is downright bad and will appeal only to die hard Adam Sandler fans or satanists. Just how bad is it? Well, keep in mind that despite appearances in the film by Harvey Keitel, Patricia Arquette, Rodney Dangerfield, Quentin Tarantino, Regis Philbin, Henry Winkler, Reese Witherspoon, Ozzy Osbourne, and cast members from ""Saturday Night Live"", the film was still was pilloried by the critics and had a very brief run in theatres."

dvd,5 of 9,5.0,"Chaplin's ""The Kid"": a picture with a smile-perhaps a tear","Charlie Chaplin began filming ""The Kid"" two weeks after the death of his three-day old son from his marriage to Mildred Harris. Chaplin had signed a new contract with First National Studio and ""The Kid"" was going to be one of the eight two-reelers Chaplin was supposed to make, but the project kept growing until the film was six reels long. As such ""The Kid"" becomes the comedian's first feature film as writer, director, and star (He had appeared as the male lead in 1914's ""Tillie's Punctured Romance,"" but that was just as an actor and not really a ""Chaplin"" comedy). "
dvd,,4.0,Smallville Complete 5th Season,"Production is of general good quality but the change in packaging causes more DVD handling.  I am extremely happy that this DVD set did not have a software glitch that skipped sectors in any episode.  This set includes the half-hour making of Reckoning(100th episode) and two episodes in two versions(standard and w/commentary).  The disk episode menu has been improved in including a scissors icon(related deleted scenes) jump to deleted scenes.  The actor for Prof.Fines, James Marsters, is doing some commentary, but I do not think that he says enough.  Another Smallville actor, John Glover, did a lot more commentary in a prior season and this allowed you to judge the intelligence that he(Glover) brings to his character.  I am a little disappointed that the show's producers have kept the SAME ending music for seasons three thru five and now six when they dumped the really nice ending theme of seasons one and two.  The major reason that I got the current season set is that regular TV reception has become poor-to-impossible on the WB(now, CW) station.  Does  ""commercial-free 23-hour Smallville Viewing Marathon"" have any other path to frutation"
dvd,,5.0,"Loved ""Rent""!!!","I saw the Broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the DVD, I think that everyone should see this movie over and over again.

They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable.  "

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Everything is a Trade Off,"A neurotic struggling writer (John Cusack playing a young Woody) makes a deal with the devil when he begins to collaborate with a genuinely talented amature playwrite (Chazz Palminteri).  The fact that the amature playwrite happens to be a mob hitman and bodyguard is merely a minor complication until the amature decides to take over the play's production and starts whacking the less talented cast.  Woody makes his best comedy when he is darkly comic.  Here, both Broadway and mob stereotypes get the treatment. Woody seems to be saying: everything comes at a cost.  All successes and all loves are, in the end, products of compromise and longing.  What do you want most and what part of you are you willing to give up for it.  "
dvd,,4.0,Excellent Mikimoto Character Designs,"This is a far above average anime with character designs by the legendary Haruhiko Mikimoto (Macross, Orguss, Gunbuster, and many others).  It has an intriguing story and beautiful effects"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Hidden gem,"Even though you probably haven't heard of this film it is exceptionally well made. The Battle of Britain from the eastern european pilot's perspective--but it really centers on the friendship of two pilots, a Polish and a Checkoslavakian flying in the RAF to defeat the Germans who over ran their homeland- who fall in love with the same English woman---a married woman at that. The aerial scenes are spectacular and seem more real than any fighter combat scenes I have seen in other WWII fighter combat films. Not a ton of money but you get a visceral feel for being in one of those old fighters--spitfires, hurricanes---and having to take on another fighter in mortal combat and at harrowing speeds. I highly recommend this film but I will warn you it is told through the 1950 perspective of the pilots who returned home after the war only to be jailed. So although there isn't a great deal of time spent in their prison it casts a sad net over the entire film that I wish wasn't there because so much in the heart of the story is light and beautiful and about the power of friendship."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent DVD,"This DVD provides a special ""Beginners View Mode"" that is really cool. They basically have 3 people doing the exercises and give you the option to select a focus on the person doing the ""light"" version of the exercises, so you can see how to get started. "
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Hercules (Disney Gold Classic Collection)  ~ Tate Donovan,"Hercules (Disney Gold Classic Collection)~ Tate Donovan is a great animated movie. Yeah it is Dinseys take on the greek classics but they do it with wink of the eye and they do not take themselves all that seriously. The animation is first class and I love the witty and smart dialogue. The songs and the music are some of the best in the business and right up their with Disneys other classics such as Shark Tale, Finding Nemo, Lion King and many others. The scene with baby hercules and baby pegasus is just too cute. Yeah it is totally different then from the old classics then again I did not expect this movie to be a retelling of a work of Homer or some other greek classical auhtor. That is the stuff that one reads in college or graduate school. This movie should not be missed. Totally recommended"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A wonderful movie today as we waited out Tropical Storm Ernesto,"My daughters (4 & 10) wanted to do SOMETHING today... but baking cookies or sewing was too much hassle for ME.  They began digging in the DVD cabinet and found this movie unopened.  We popped it in the player and spent a wonderful afternoon together watching it.  The cinematography was beautiful, the actress playing Sara was just perfect and my girls sat upright watching every moment.  The brief scene with her father in war was a bit frightening - so they hid their heads.  "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"Out there, yet engaging","A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"All Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty)"
dvd,,5.0,a terrific 80's classic,"This film hit a nerve with anyone in highschool during the mid-to-late 80's, and the commentary on popularity still holds true today. The number of cliques in my school was staggering, and I meandered from group to group, never dropping anchor. I stayed sane, while watching everyone else fall apart. LOL. I knew quite a few ""Heathers"". All the same basically; school being not so much academic as social. Most of the adult figures in the film are mindless twits, oblivious to the needs of youth. This is still one of my top ten favorite movies"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Thornton's bravura entry into Hollywoodland.,"Sling Blade (1996) Billy Bob Thornton went for the Oscar gold in this, his own personal magnum opus. It's the moving tale of a mentally handicapped man adjusting to society after being locked away for matricide. The late John Ritter backs him up well in what was probably his greatest film role. Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in the picture. My generation's equivalent of Orson Welles handling all duties on Citizen Kane. I was highly disappointed that Thornton lost the Oscar for this work, his best ever."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,This Cat Has Style!,"Sure, it would have been great if the Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss  alliance would have continued for this outing (their ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""Horton Hears A Who"" are unquestionable classics) but this is a noble effort.. a VERY noble effort.  ""The Cat in the Hat"" was always been my favorite Dr. Seuss book. Having said that, I felt the top notch vocal talent (Allan Sherman will forever be the Cat in the Hat, sorry Mike Meyers!) and whimsical screenplay really fleshed out the book playful theme ... and the Geisel penned songs were truly inspired!  So the animation is a little off.  This is going to be considered quite the classic when that stinker of a movie opens this winter"
dvd,,5.0,Great performance.,"While I don't usually go for real tear-jerker movies like this, I found this movie to be a very touching story.  The actors involved performed superbly.  I was particularly impressed with Jennifer Love Hewitt's performance.  I think this may be her best performance yet.  It's a shame this movie isn't more well known"
dvd,2 of 6,2.0,"Wow, another steamy pile from spielberg and cruise","Sorry, after minority report, which actually looked great compared to this performance of cruise, i didn't think it could get worse...yeah, it did.  I didn't rank a one because it was a classic story, and the action was ok at times, but Crazy Cruise was just a stinker in it. I just didn't care for his performance.  I can't help expecting every time tom cruise opens his mouth to expect to hear ""show me the money"".   I was hoping spielberg would have cast an unknown in this spot, or someone that could look a bit more grubby, more manly, cruise still looks like a kid.  Definitely not the original radio brodcast.  Tim Robins did a fair job, I would have liked to see him in the main character roll than cruise. Catch this one on TV, HBO or something, or rent it if you must, just not my collection type movie though. I know my review is taking a beating, but I just didn't care for this movie"

dvd,,4.0,If I only had the sand to work out in.....,"I like the DVD a lot, except some of the exercises are clearly not meant for the livingroom environment, but I pick and choose from the different fitnesses ideas and voila, I am rocking. David is really good in motivating constantly, and I even like the ""special Davids"".  For a normal human being, it is extremely difficult to get a personal trainer like David anywhere, so his DVDs are the best next thin"
dvd,0 of 2,1.0,It's not that bad....it's WORSE!,"This movie was a total waste of time, money and film. It was awful on every level. The characters were lame and unbelievable, I had no sympathy for any of them. In most movies Kevin Costner is a generally a bland, cardboard actor to begin with, now combine that with a really badly written character, slow script, weak supporting roles and a predictable ending and you have this so-bad-it's-tragic movie. It isn't even ""So bad it's good"" material, it's just painfully bad and super boring. It's a shame too, because it's a good concept and they could have done a lot more with the story. Instead they made a weak story with super-inflated budget. Maybe if they spent less on all the explosions (which after a while ceased to be impressive) they could have hired some decent writers. I really kept wishing every character in the movie would blow up, drown or die a horrible death. This movie was a 'washout' in every way. Waterbarf, Waterweak, Waterbad, Waterbore...any nickname I could think of would not be bad enough. I would never watch this again even if someone paid me! "
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,A brief comment,"I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment."
dvd,7 of 8,2.0,Chaplin Classic Deserves a Better DVD,"Warner must have fell asleep at the wheel with its DVD reissue of Charlie Chaplin's ""Monsieur Verdoux."" The ""remastered"" print is dark, murky and virtually unwatchable. In fact, it's a strain on the eyes! The additional star is given only for the extras -- especially the excellent ""Chaplin Today"" documentary. This DVD should be taken off the market until Warner gets its act together."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent,"This DVD is awesome!!!!  We got this for our daughter when she was 3 yrs. old.  She loved it immediately.  It taught her her letter sounds and how to start sounding out her letters when she's trying to read.  Now, my 18 month old son LOVES this show.  He's been watching it for a couple of months now.  He knows a lot of his letters and their sounds by sight.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
dvd,4 of 26,2.0,Another disappointment for the fans...,"Once again, the folks who run the Bond franchise have made a mistake and aren't thinking. When will they finally get it through their skulls that fans of James Bond want the ENTIRE collection instead of just a select few?"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Guilty pleasures,"I'm not a television watcher, but every now and then when I hear enough about a show, my curiosity sometimes sparks me to see at least one episode.  ""The O.C."" had been on for about two years, I had no interest in seeing it whatsoever, I thought just another shallow ""Beverly Hills 90210""/""Melrose Place"" repeat but now in Orange County.  I ended up renting the first disc of the show thinking; oh I'll watch the first episode and return it, that'll be enough.  Boy was I wrong!  I got hooked completely.  Everyone in the O.C. is shallow and lost except for the main characters you see on the cover.  The writer's did a fantastic job at creating an insatiable hook through each episode, the cast is phenomenal and that was a shocker to me, they really did an awesome job at delivering the lines, all have amazing chemistry, and what I loved also about the show is that it's not just appealing to teens, it's by far not a teeny bopper show.  The real scene stealers are the Cohens, the parents, Kirsten and Sandy and their sidekick son, Seth.  The strong family who rule Newport and everyone flocks to for support.  If you've never seen this and are contemplating viewing it, rent the first disc and watch the first episode, see how quickly you'll get sucked into these people's drama"

dvd,,4.0,"Sharp, witty, right on target","Filmmaker Noah Baumbach nails the thing with jealousy and obsession dead on in this really sharp comedy. What makes this so much fun is the obviously high level of intelligence on display throughout the entire film. The movie hit home pretty hard; I recently met a beautiful woman I totally wigged out over and thanks to my obsessive behavior, she dropped me--not like a hot potato, but instead a volcanic one. (I hung my head for a couple of weeks after that)."
dvd,8 of 13,5.0,Charming,"I love European films. They have a different quality than that of the American ones. La Busch had that quality. It has no action, or sex, and that was just fine with me.

dvd,1 of 6,2.0,What's All the Fuss About?,"The lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real Edward R. Murrow, and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the `50s, but otherwise I'd didn't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short, boring movie that seemed much longer.  Maybe I've just seen too many biopics lately"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Feel the Night Fever!,"Saturday Night Fever is a classic 70's movie starring a young John Travolta (Pulp Fiction). Today, nearly 30 years after its release, both the movie and its leading star are still stunning!"
dvd,0 of 9,1.0,I GIVE IT ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE RALPH FIENNES IS IN IT,"This movie has been terribly hyped-up, for reasons unbeknownst to me, perhaps politically, I presume, in the usual Hollywood fashion.  It has got to be one of the most slow-moving, boring, uninteresting movies I have had the pain of having to waste my time on ~ while attempting to sit through it.  However, the one and only good thing about it is that Ralph Fiennes is in it ~ but that is all.  Don't waste your money and time on this dud, as I'm sorry I did"
dvd,13 of 14,5.0,Humor and energy,"Despite the fact that their debut album provides their entire play list, Scissor Sisters manage to deliver a DVD collection that includes a full-length concert, several music videos, a documentary, and much more! This DVD reportedly includes some Easter eggs as well, for those with the patience or equipment to find that sort of thing."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Proves That  The 60s Produced the Real Talent!,"Someone wondered why Aretha Franklin is the Queen of Soul.  Obviously, they know NOTHING about soul music!  Go back, my misguided friend, and just listen to Aretha's first recordings on Columbia Records, starting when she was a mere 18 years old and you will hear WHY she is called ""Queen.""  Franklin made some amazing recordings at that company even before her Golden Years at Atlantic and Arista Records.  During the 60s through the 80s, Franklin racked up countless, in-person, electrifying performances, the likes of which SHOULD have been filmed for eternity."
dvd,15 of 15,4.0,"The Much Needed ""Side-Step""","2nd Gig's opening has been relentless and bold, leaving us to wonder, ""so will any of these episodes truly 'Stand-alone' as they did last season?""  Well, the answer is ""not really"" but the motion is so good that it won't matter."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"We'll Meet Again, Some Sunny Day","Saskia is such a charming, winsome girl, it's no wonder boyfriend Rex can't get over her disappearance. He's obsessed, but then he left her alone once in the dark, and is fated never to repeat that first abandonment."
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,The Best Musicals,Busby Berkeley influenced movie musical making in a big way. His choreography really transformed popular music into an extravaganza. The films included in this collection truly embody the beginnings of movie musicals and one of the best times for films period. 
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Eat...Drink...Man...Woman...,"Folks, I have 'skipped' this movie every time that I ran into it on cable, simply due to the fact that I missed the very beginning.  I just don't know why, but today I made an exception and stopped to watch it.  Now, I've got to get my copy so that I, among everyone else, can enjoy this fine film at my leisure.  Ang Lee does it again - and we are better for it.  Five stars!"

dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Brilliant! I can't believe people think it had plot-holes!,"I loved this movie. I didn't think the plot was patchy at all, and I didn't think it was hurried either. What i do think is that people forget that the movie company had the third movie already in the makes when the second was in theaters. "
dvd,,4.0,Sexy and thought provoking romance,"I saw this movie years ago and decided to grab the DVD. The director, Jean-Jaques Annaud, is fantastic and the casting is top notch.  "
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Fast Times indeed!,"One of the classic high school movies, Fast Times spawned a slew of teenage talent on the big screen, but no one was more memorable in this movie than Sean Penn as Spicoli.  Amy Heckerling cuts out a slice of Southern Californian life from a San Bernardino high school that shows both honor students and misfits alike.  While the signature moments belonged to Spicoli, there were many other great scenes such as the ongoing burger war in which Judge Reinhold finds himself on the short end of the spatula.  Meanwhile his little sis, a seemingly innocent Jennifer Jason Leigh, experiments with dating and sex with an amusing pair of misfits, Brian Backer and Robert Romanus.  Phoebe Cates tries to set her young prodigy straight but to no avail.  Forest Whitaker even has a significant moment in this movie as the bruising defensive lineman who takes out the destruction of his prized car on the opposing team.  Little did he know that Spicoli had a hand in it.  But, it is the hilarious relationship between Spicoli and Mr. Hand (Ray Walston) that steals the show.  Fast Times may appear a bit dated, but it hasn't lost any of its humor. "
dvd,2 of 16,5.0,"Bottom line:  DVDs small, VHS big",I did like this dvd.  I bought it and put it in the machine and it worked.  The sound and picture were better than my old vhs.  Also the dvd is smaller and so takes less space (phew!).  I did think it was racist though to portray black people as slaves
dvd,46 of 46,4.0,"Nice, Overall Look at WDW","This History Channel produced documentary provides a nice, overall view behind the scenes at one of the world's most popular tourist attractions, Walt Disney World. "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,That couch has been there for 15 years and nobody ever tripped over it before.,Preston Sturges' The Lady Eve is a great screwball romantic comedy starring Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck.  The story concerns a young son (Henry Fonda) of a rich brewer who is a snake-enthusiast and has been in the Amazon who meets a con artist (Barbara Stanwyck).  
dvd,2 of 3,2.0,What a shame,"This sounded like such a good idea - one routine with instruction, and one without.  But it doesn't really work.  First of all, the routine with instruction isn't a routine.  She shows things, then explains them, and it's too jerky to get a proper workout, in my opinion.  Whereas say with Stott, she explains as you're working out, and you get your session."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,inspiring sports movie for tweens & early teens (& adults too),"My 10 year old loves this movie about a renegade gymnast who finds a way to retain her maverick spirit in the rigid world of competitive gymnastic and finds redemption. The movie is hip, credible and inspiring. The performances are great, as is the soundtrack. In addition, it is a fascinating and educational inside look at gymnastics that will be interesting even to those with no previous interest in the sport"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent DVD edition,This 20th anniversary edition of Platoon is the DVD we've been waiting for. Picture and sound are excellent and offer the best experience of Oliver Stone's Vietnam memoir yet. 
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"A great drama, with amazing depth","'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they concieved of this complex story."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Repetition and Catchy Tunes!,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday (and for my 26 month old to enjoy as well).  As you can imagine during the birthday party all the kids were running around, yelling, playing, etc..  Well, I popped this video in for some down time, and as soon as it started playing all the kids stopped what they were doing and became afixed to the TV.  My husband came out of the kitchen asking what was going on, why was it so quiet.  Since than, my kids have watched it several times and my son is now able to count to twenty! THANK YOU-THANK YOU-THANK YOU!!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great movie for parents ,This movie was very helpful for me.  I have struggled with an eating disorder for a very long time and the movie helped me feel lIke I was not alone.  There was very good explanations of how the family structure can effect a person going through such a disorder and how they can help the individual get well. I would recommend this book to any parent raising girls as well as boys.  
dvd,,5.0,So cute!,"It's rare a movie comes along that is good for both kids and adults. This one does it beautifully! I wish they made stuff like this when I was a kid! The animation is amazing, the voices are funny, the plot HILARIOUS! Zoo animals suddenly find themselves on an island...The rest is just pure joy! A fun movie I would watch again.   "
dvd,1 of 5,2.0,Ridiculous,"Are there are actually people comparing this to Oldboy? Oldboy was flabbergasting. It delivers an invisible slap of surprise on the watcher's face. Mr. Vengeance fails miserably at creating any sort of effect whatsoever. The storyline is a bit challenged, if you ask me. There is no real feeling of revenge and most of the time the screenplay with characters coming in and going out creates confusion. It took me a while to understand what's actually going on. I watched this 40 days back and can't even recall what happens in the end. What's even more confusing is that I've known to have a prodigious memory of mind, or atleast I claim to."

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,TMNT Original series (Season 2),"13 golden episodes that make up the second season. No extras, just turtles. I love this DVD"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,i never get tired of this one....,"i saw OFM when it first came out, over ten years back.  it was on cable the other day.  it still keeps me glued to the set.  bill paxton, billy bob thornton, michael beach....great work.  too bad this one didn't get more media and a larger audience"
dvd,17 of 18,4.0,Good video,"I thought this was a very good video, but if you are interested in the long Yang form, this is the more modernized, wu shu version of it rather than the original Yang Chen Fu version, according to my instructor. "
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Powerful and unsentimental,"Seen again for the first time in a couple of decades, Warner's beautifully restored DVD of The Nun's Story is a real surprise, avoiding the mawkish sentimentality that usually accompanied old Hollywood's approach to Catholicism with a sober, quiet unostentatious majesty and a mostly successful attempt to avoid clich� (there's no romance with Peter Finch's surgeon as you might expect). Fred Zinnemann, who now seems on the verge of being completely forgotten, constantly does things slightly differently - not just jump cutting from continent to continent, but avoiding convention in subtle ways. When Sister Luke departs for the Congo, not only is her departure handled in the bare minimum of shots but they're also not the ones you usually expect: no head on shots of the ship leaving for the open sea, but instead zooming out from a sideways view before cutting to the ship's wake. The visual economy never feels Spartan, but at the same time it fits the subject matter perfectly. "
dvd,,5.0,HYSTERICALLY funny... perfectly funny no matter what your preference or cultural background!,I'm not going to review the plot... amazon provides a decent one. I'm just going to supply my thoughts on the film.
dvd,,4.0,Stomp Out Loud,I was totally entertained and amazed at the talent of these young people.  It can be watched numerous times without ever getting bored.  Highly recommend
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,The Green Mile,"Stellar performances from all of the cast.  The story is compelling, and you really get to fall in love with Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is accused of a horror of a charge that he did not commit.  This is one of those movies that may test your threshold for crying.  Be sure to have some kleenex handy.  Five stars for this fine title"
dvd,,5.0,The Dark Knight that Burton promised but never delivered is finallly here.,"All the press releases to the first Batman by Burton alluded to how different the character would be older, darker, at conflict with continuing role as a crime fighter. What we got was a semblance attempt by Michael Keaton, brow furrowed thru most of the film, to deal with his dual identity which came off shallow and unconvincing and of course being outclassed by Nichcolsons Joker didnt help either."
dvd,2 of 2,1.0,ummmmm,"So sad. Someone get her help....please? I have never felt this way even after watching the worst soft core, skin-a-max porn,. This has pushed me to a limit I have never experienced. And not in a good way. Man, what has this world come to. No wonder she is tweeked out after starring in this dreck."
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,The World of Crossword Puzzles Explored - Good Stuff,"For me, crossword puzzles have been a casual thing, I might find one in the airline magazine on a flight and work on it to pass the time or my wife, who is a much more avid fan, might have left a partially finished one about, which I will pick up and see if I can find some answers."
dvd,,5.0,A Bit of Nostalgia,"This is a delightful film!  Starring Fred Astaire and Jane Powell,it revolves around the 1950's wedding of Elizabeth and Phillip.  The dancing, of course, is all the elegance, dexterity, and mind-popping steps we would expect from Astaire, even later in his career.  Jane Powell's gorgeous and poignant voice is another strong reason to get this film.  It is a treasure--the music, especially such pieces as Jane's ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Too Late Now"" are signature songs--so lovely--and they capture an era for many of us that has never been far from our hearts.  Astaire's wonderful, rollicking, ""I Left My Hat in Haiti"" is a charming mixture of song and his unique dance.  The plot is rather Shakespearean--the mixup of lovers--but everything turns out happily in the end.  The bonus?  London--in one of the world's happiest periods! This is a movie to cherish"
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Pearl of a Survivor,"Aired during the Fall Season of 2003 on CBS, most fans will tell you that Survivor: Pearl Islands had many qualities to make it one of the most entertaining seasons of the Survivor franchise. Key among them is the varied and engaging cast of characters. One that comes to mind is Andrew Savage, the hot, fortyish attorney with thighs that could splinter an Oak. And speaking of thighs, there's Burton, another fellow Survivor who could do his own number on a Ponderosa Pine. Levity and eye candy aside, most of the folks who participated in this Panama edition were arguably the most cut throat, ambitious crew, even prompting host Jeff Probst to quip at one Tribal Council, ""Clearly, you are the masters of the blind side"". "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar,great movie great soundtrack one of the best themed movies i have seen in a whil
dvd,,1.0,Awful,"I wanted this movie to be good, but boy was I disappointed.  I've seen home movies with more acting, plot and feelings. Parker Posey should be embarrassed that she was in it.  Save your money. The one guy is kind of hot so if you're looking for a butt shot, rent it and fast forward.  "
dvd,13 of 17,4.0,Great adaptation of classic heroes.,"While it'd be impossible for any films to do justice to Marvel's legendary team of super-powered mutants, I really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for.  The casting was strong, the action was solid, most of the characters were portrayed memorably, and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the X-men. The first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced, but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and old-school X-fans. Hugh Jackman was spot-on as Wolverine, the most iconic X-man and arguably the hardest to cast and Famke Jansen was a fantastic Jean Grey for at least the first two films.  Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellan (Magneto), and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique) also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons.  The story was a nice update of the comics and followed Rogue's induction into Professor X's school for mutants and Magneto's first big terrorist attack on mankind. All-in-all, a satisfying start to the series.  The second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite X-men, including Nightcrawler (whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film), Pyro, and Iceman. The story involves Wolverine's past and the government's attempts to control the ever-growing mutant population.  The result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch.  For some ridiculous reason, at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last.  This was a bad choice that made no kind of sense, upset the films' fans, and severly hurt the quality of the third film.  Ah, the third film; a mixed bag to say the least.  The plot deals with two classic storylines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary Dark Phoenix.  My personal list of complaints is a long one, but I'll just hit a few in this review.  ""X-men: The Last Stand"" tries to cram two movies' worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with.  The introduction of the Phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the all-time classics in comic history, and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic, like why an all-powerful entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorist's side and just look menacing for most of the story.  The series' former darling, Rogue, is reduced to a brooding plot-nuisance, has no real influence on the story, plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine.  On the other hand, more classic characters are given parts such as fan-favorite Kitty Pride and Collossus (both of which had cameos in X2), Angel, Multiple Man, Beast (played nicely by Kelsey Grammer), and the almighty Juggernaut (whose battle with Kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected).  But as many characters as there were that made it into the three films, there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny, unnamed cameos in the series, or forgotten altogether. No Gambit, Emma Frost, Sinister, Apocalypse, Scarlet Witch, or Havok to name just a few.  Furthermore, the final film's resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead, though they do leave us a glimmer of hope.  There are talks of Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs and possibly a New Mutants project; promising ideas, but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love.  Still, in the end, I really did enjoy X3 as a film as it did have several great stand-up-and-cheer moments; it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series.  In the end, whether you're a fan of the comics, the cartoons, or just a fan of sci-fi or fun movies in general, you really shouldn't miss out on these three movies.  The series is full of memorable characters, fantastic battles, sly humor, references for hard-core fans, and, of course, the classic X-men social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness.  There doesn't appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition; but for about $10 a flick, I'll let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain.  Highly recommended set"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Everyone Likes It Hot!,"Some Like It Hot is a rollicking & wild romantic comedy caper which will leave you rolling with laughter and wanting to go off and join a band in drag.  Well, at least the thought may just cross your mind after you see what it does for Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon."
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Simply Great..... just like Chaplin,"I rented this movie in order to know more about Chaplin for a college work, I did not expect such a masterpiece, it is impossible not to love Chaplin's genius, the autobiographical sense when he preaches to Terry is absolutely convincing because it is real.  The man is simply bigger than life.  This movie is a must have, you will not regret it"
dvd,3 of 4,1.0,Great Film What was Columbia Pictures thinking with this Poor DVD Release?!,I still own the original DVD release for this film which sports the great panavision 2.20:1 aspect ratio... how can you offer a new and better special edition of a film like this and use a Pan/Scan version beefed up by new audio tracks? Who ever was responsible for this should have been fired immediatly nbo questions asked they obviously have no love for the original aspect ratio of any film let alone Annie. What a waste of a release and time and effort.
dvd,1 of 4,1.0,wack Movie,sat through this mess of a film the other night&while it had a couple of ok moments it was truly a mess. the jokes weren't really there&the story just kinda was made up as it went along.  not much to this film at all.  this film felt like 4-5 movies put together for the sake of  formula basic humor. no depth whatsoever
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Cool... very cool!,"Not exactly a concert video, but not really a documentary either.  The few concert videos I've seen (including U2's ""Elevation"") are of a single edited concert, and largely limited to a handful of cameras and angles.  In contrast, ""Rattle & Hum"" shows a series of different concerts around the US during their Joshua Tree tour with incredible camera angles that put you right on the stage.  But it goes a bit beyond that and shows some rehersals and recording sessions for some of the new songs, some backstage shots, and a few brief interviews, but not to the point where you would really call it a ""documentary.""  The Edge really puts it best when he says (about the film), ""it's about music."""
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"James and Arnold, a daring duo ",A fun shoot-im-up with lots of good chase scenes and a few good plot twists. One of the things that make the movie is Arnold going around strait faced and like the terminator without the metal endoskeleton.

It is really great. I would suggest starting with the beginner's mat workout video, to get familiar with some of the moves a little more. I haven't listened to the CD yet, but hope to get that on my MP3 player so I can finish my workout at the gym with some pilates"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,One of my favorites,"What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is ""I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job."" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, ""I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too."" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how ""real"" Furious was. ""Young"" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today. "

dvd,,5.0,Great,"This is a great family movie, my son and my niece really enjoy watching the movie.  I really recommend this movie to familyies with children"
dvd,5 of 7,4.0,Worth revisiting...,"They say timing is everything and this certainly applies to the release and reception of movies. Case in point: Mulholland Falls. Released a year before the very similar L.A. Confidential, Falls was also a retro-noir set in 1950s Los Angeles that featured a murder mystery leading to a vast conspiracy. However, Falls was promptly blasted by the critics and quickly disappeared from theatres while Confidential became the toast of critics and award shows all over the world. So, what went wrong? Falls featured a cast of solid character actors (it had more name actors than Confidential) and a critically acclaimed director with Once Were Warriors' Lee Tamahori as opposed to Confidential's Curtis Hanson who had only done adequate B-movies like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. Now that a few years have passed, Mulholland Falls has aged surprisingly well."
dvd,,5.0,Still Healthy After Four Years,"Many sitcoms become stale after their first few years; the writers run out of new ideas and the actors become disenfranchised with the series.  Such is not the case for Scrubs; while it's first two seasons are definitely the strongest, Season 4 is still extremely well written and acted.  Creator Bill Lawrence and his writing staff are able to keep the characters from getting boring by actually causing things to change at Sacred Heart Hospital while the actors are as funny and into the material as ever.  In fact, I think that Neil Flynn, whose Janitor character should have been a one-trick pony, improves his character each year."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"First-Rate Movie, Great Acting, Great Atmosphere","It's 1948 in Los Angeles and Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington) is out of work, short of cash and late with a couple of house payments. He's offered $100 to find a woman named Daphne Monet, who is the missing girl friend of a candidate for Los Angeles mayor, a candidate who has just withdrawn from the race. Then people start to die and Easy gets set up for the fall unless he can quickly find out what's going on. To help him, he calls on a long-time friend named Mouse Alexander (Don Cheadle). With Mouse around, the bodies really start piling up. ""You told me not to shoot him. I didn't. I choked him. If you ain't want me to kill him, why'd you leave him with me?"" Mouse asks reasonably at one point."

dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Gan-ZU!!,"I have to admit first off that I am not an anime fanatic, but I have seen a few. This particular series, however, I watched in 3 days...yes, the whole series. From the beginning I was hooked with the graphic violence and the humorous and often true to life thoughts of the main character. Upon getting through the first 6 or so episodes, I could not stop watching! It was almost painful to stop watching it. I related so much with the characters and their struggles (even though mine are not so adventurous) that I could not help identifying and truly being there with them until the end... Without saying much about the story itself, I would advise anyone who is into anime, even a little, to get this series. I bought the box sets, but I am sure that after the first volume you will be hooked"

But with  used price of 2-3 dollars, this is a pretty good buy, but ONLY  if you never plan on getting the wonderful boxed sets."

For the life of me I can see how any Studio worth its salt could release anything so poor; where has ""Pride In Your Work"" gone. I could hardly make out the actors in this movie."
dvd,,5.0,Lucy and Ricky,"Over 50 years ago a show previewed.The I Love Lucy show.A show that would make history.I give this season 5 stars and would give 100 if it went that high.If you want a show full of fun and laughs, and the way television used to be before the anything goes generation took over.just set back and get lost in the way we all wish life could be again"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL,"For ardent blues aficionados and neophytes, this is an excellent foray into what makes the blues the blues.  Many people like to gloss over the arduous road black musicians had to surmount in order to even be heard by an audience outside their own neighborhoods---not here.  We all need to be schooled by those who not only paved the way for those to follow, but to remember that they cleared the land, leveled the path, mixed the asphalt and never missed a beat into the bargain.  Here are people who would have played to a cat on the front porch, much like the musicians in the equally excellent ""Buena Vista Social Club"".  They play for the simple reason that the music is in them and needs to get out!  No telling can be entirely comprehensive, and this one is not.  But is sheds unflinching light on music that triumphs.  The archival footage is its true treasure.  Just to see these inimitable musicians in their own metier is worth the price of admission.  This dvd is akin to an art history course.  sometimes, we look at a painting and say, ""I hate it!""  But when you understand some of what the artist was living through, you can appreciate it---perhaps, even come to like it.  Same with the blues.  You might not like it at first, but when you hear and learn what the artists were living through at the time, you come to respect their expression.  Kudos to all involved with this project.  It bears up over several viewings as well"
dvd,,5.0,Definitive Jazz Documentary ,"This is a wonderful documentary series, unfortunately edited down for British TV (if you want the full series then purchase the 10-disc set in NTSC format). The series is absorbing from disc 1 and I thought I knew a fair bit about jazz until I started watching this. The social context is extraordinary and we are given an insight into a range of jazz masters. The importance of Louis Armstrong forms a vital string from beginning to end, but we are given the life stories of a good number of influential jazz performers and arrangers, particularly Jelly Roll Morton, Duke Ellington, Sidney Bechet, and many others. The interviews that make up the narrative are superb, Wynton Marsalis in particular, who talks and plays with real authority. I can't praise this series highly enough - an essential purchase for anyone who is interested in music generally, and in jazz in particular. There is also a companion CD box set that can be purchased - excellent for anyone who wants to dip into jazz through the decades."
dvd,,5.0,Wes Anderson's best?,"God, I love me some Wilson brothers... especially with Wes at the helm. They are so kooky and yet entirely endearing and approachable. The script is endlessly quotable, the construction of the film is tight and smooth all at once... it's funny as hell with characters you can't help loving. I watch this movie over and over, and when my eight year old daughter quotes Dignan (Owen): ""You do not give a $500 tip to the housekeeper. That's inappropriate!"" (with perfect inflections) I just about die laughing"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,A Film  Masterpiece of the Twentieth Century,"I would definitely  recommend that  one reads the original novel first, otherwise the characters and  trend of the  story as  outlined in the movie may be confusing. A particularly good English language translation of the novel  is the Oxford World's Classics paperback version.  It contains maps of the battles and campaigns as well as a who's who of  them main characters  and families, useful chapter notes and the authors appendix ""Some Words about War and Peace"". All of these will add to  the enjoyment of watching the film. Alternatively  obtain and watch the 1956  Hollywood version first  which has many fine  actors such as Audrey Hepburn, Herbert Lom, John Mills and  so on. A much shorter movie than the Russian epic but will help in  following the Russian film it and is quite a delightful movie  in its own right. "

dvd,,5.0,Dr Who?,"I recall READING about Dr Who's adventures when I was a kid. That was about 14 years ago. I vaguely recall his travelling phone booth and the invasion of the Daleks. I sketched little Daleks all over my textbooks and I think my cousins whom got the books passed down didn't know what the hell they were. Hearing about the BBC's new take of the Doctor made me want to watch it. I didn't watch the older series (as mentioned, only read the books) but I heard nothing but good things about this new series and decided to try it out. It took a while (a short while) to get used to it. But I must say that I'm a fan again. Although the buildup of the entire series was great (my girlfriend particularly liked the episode with Rose's dad), the final episode with... well. The ENDING of the series didn't really go that well with me. Kinda silly. But I had a great ride. For those that are worried that Dr Who might be foreign or even alien to them, you don't have to. My girlfriend loved it and my friends whom I've passed the discs around all love it too. It will grow on you and after that, you'll just want to continue each and every episode until the end. Check out the interesting special features too, behind the scenes documentary by Rose regarding life on the set. BBC's done it right and the only sad thing I must say (other than the lacklustre ending) is that they had to change the Doctor in season 2. I can't judge the new Doctor as I don't get the show over here in Singapore, but after watching Season 1, I hate to see the change. Overall, a fantastic series and well worth the time and money. The rest of the episodes more than make up for the ending. So do check it out. Great price too. Bloody expensive in HMV Singapore."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Suspenseful,"This movie starts a little slow, but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller.  Bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little ""thing"" that just makes him creepy.  Typical of an early 90s thriller, this movie is sure to entertain.  If you liked ""Fear"" then you will like ""The Vanishing"" as well"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,A Mystery wrapped in an enigma,"I'm so thrilled to see this.  Normally I'm cheap, watching for those deals.  But when I ran into this collection how could I not buy it--it's the ONLY item or star, for whom I would pay any price to own a definitive collection.  I'm not even bothered that I'm paying more for it than it was previously promoted at. There will never be another like her.  Not as a screen presence, as a cultural icon, nor as a truly fascinating person. She really stuck to her retirement and private life.  Normally famous people retire and they cannot remain so--too addicted to the fame, I guess.  Yet here is one who did. I cannot wait to open it and start the love affair all over again"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,BIG,"After being fired from directing I, The Jury, Larry Cohen bounced back with his independant low budget monster movie, Q.  Cohen also had a bit of revenge on his former employers coz Q did much better at the box office than I, The Jury.  Cohen's film is a wonderful homage to the giant monster films of the 50s and 60s.  Basically it's a giant lizard/bird flying around New York eating whoever it can.  There's also some wacky priest-type guy making human sacrifices to the thing.  Whether this bird magically appeared because of the sacrifices, or if it's just an ancient creature, mistaken for a god, that has happened to come out of hiding is up to you to guess.  Both scenarios are hinted at.  David Carradine and Richard Roundtree take on the bird and sacrifice cases while thief Michael Moriarty bungles a robbery and finds out where the bird lives.  Eventually these characters join forces.  This is a B movie naturally, but Cohen has always had a talent for making very good B films-B+ films if you like.  He's always able to make the most of his budget.  The bird is a fake looking stop motion creation, but it doesn't matter coz Cohen is so good with the characterization and plot that it makes no difference if we ever see the creature at all!  Can you say that about a billion dollar Roland Emmerich cgi monster crapfest?  No way, Jose!!!  Q is an extremely fun film.  You know it has to be if my wife enjoyed it.  Good performances all around as well(Cohen says in the commentary he considered no-names Bruce Willis and Eddie Murphy for the leads!!), especially David Carradine, who's actually quite good as the cop.  He has one of the funniest lines as the police fire upon the monster from the top of a skyscraper.  He looks at his partner and says with a smile, ""Big!""  Another winner from Blue Underground"

dvd,11 of 11,5.0,Intelligent horror movies!,"It took me a while to view my copy of ""The HP Lovecraft Collection Vol. 1"" featuring ""Cool Air"", but I am so glad I did. The packaging and design of the disk, including the supplemental booklet (laid out as an 18th century pamphlet), are exceptionally classy and informative. The disk itself contains the featurette, ""Cool Air"", which is a very moving adaptation of Lovecraft's story of the same name and starring Jack Donner (""Star Trek"", ""Man from U.N.C.L.E"", many others) and shot on black and white 16mm film. The amazing set, costumes, writing and acting, led by Bryan Moore (writer/director, and playing lead Randolph Carter) will show you what can be done with a little amount of money and a large amount of talent. The ""making of"" bonus materials explain how much went into completing the film; that in and of itself is a tear-wrenching story. "
dvd,,5.0,NCIS,If you like CSI then you will like this too. This about the arm forces. not a show for very  young chidren.You would need to watch it before children see it. It is clean but some times not for children. CSI is more focus on lab work and get out and try to solve it and do with in one hour.
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Where is Season 2?,Finally a complete season of this excellent anthology series...but where is the rest? 
dvd,121 of 127,1.0,Lousy DVD from Hart Sharp Video,"This review refers to the uncut DVD version. Like the other reviewers here, I loved this movie. The movie I would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress Juliette Marquis (from Ukraine no less). The image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video. I can undertand and accept that. This DVD however is a lousy Pan and Scan version. Some movies can be Pan and Scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future TV transfers in mind. But this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and didn't make room for transfer to fullscreen TV. It is intensely frustrating to watch this damned DVD. You watch noses talking to half faces, half faces talking to ears, heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly. I am furious at the studio a__holes at Hart Sharp Video who sanctioned this Pan and Scan monstrosity. And they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen. To add insult to injury, they show pictures on the back cover and the insert, of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the Pan and Scan cropped crap. Hart Sharp Video goes straight to my list of Never Buy From Again. By all means see this movie - at the theater. Or wait till a more responsible company releases a new DVD edition"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,The gaffer's cut of Pat Garret?,"The new version of Pat Garrett, which has the scene where James Coburn visits his wife, restored to the first act is in no way an improvement over the last version.  The previous version which was derived from a previewed version of the film is vastly superior.  There was a  reason why this scene was cut from the preview version, and that is because it plain didn't work, and killed the first act stone dead at that point.  One has to believe that Roger Spottiswoode knew what he was doing when he prepared the ""preview version"", he was, after all, one of the editorial team on this film. "
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Prompt delivery,I ordered two of these and recieved them very quickly. One had come dislodged from the bracket that secures it inside the dvd case and so was scratched up pretty bad. But I don't know how the seller could have prevented that from happening so all and all I'm quite satisfied with my purchase
dvd,1 of 10,2.0,Sorry,"This movie is so freakin stupid. Yes its funny...but so very dumb. Not good dumb; bad dumb. Terribly, painfully stupid. Funny at times. Best avoided or taken in small doses"
dvd,4 of 6,4.0,"Impressive playing, and impressive production","Lang Lang has a very solid technique, and is obviously very comfortable on stage.  He clearly favours clarity in his lines, and he brings it off with style.  He has much to offer as a performer right now, and it will be interesting to see how he develops in the years to come."
dvd,1 of 15,2.0,No thank you.,"I found Yi Yi to be a tedious film, at times the action and characters felt quite contrived and cliched. The subtitles were poorly highlighted and I often could not figure out who was speaking the line. The only refreshing thing in the movie was the final scene at the grandmother's funeral, but it was not worth a three hour wait to get to this poigant scene. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one"
dvd,,5.0,"Never explain, never apologise.....","This is yet one more brilliant film in the Lynch universe.  I've loved everything he's done (even Twin Peaks: Firewalk With Me), and he seems to get better with each film.  This film was originally a TV pilot (!), but it was rejected by ABC as ""too weird"".  That really isn't too surprising.  So David got additional funds, and made into one of his best films.  I don't want to hear any explanations of what actually occured in the film.  All I know is that it did occur, and I felt it, whatever it was.  That's good enough for me and the rest of the world.  Even Roger Ebert liked this film, even though I think it was because the majority of critics adored it, and Ebert didn't want to be in constrast to the crowd (Ebert has always been hostile to Lynch's work).  The performances are superb all around, with kudos going to Justin Theroux as ""the director"", who has a great scene with studio heads about ""the girl"".  Love the golf club!  I'm looking forward to Inland Empire, a 3 hour helping from Mr. Lynch.  Lovely. "
dvd,18 of 19,5.0,Far ahead of its time,"Airing around the same time The Simpsons started, I always thought the two shows had nearly identical humor, however The Simpsons went on to unprecedented success while Get a Life feebly crawled at the bottom of the ratings for two years before being cancelled.  I always thought that if Get a Life had been animated then it would have shared in the success enjoyed by The Simpsons.  Maybe a real, live, in-the-flesh Chris Elliott was a little too creepy for the mainstream audiences."

dvd,,5.0,Finally!  FINALLY!  OHMYGOD FINALLY!!!!!  YAY!!!!!,"I've owned the few M:I VHS tapes since they first came out, and I've been heartsick that no others were ever released.  As more and more TV shows were released in DVD boxed sets, I waited, first patiently, then impatiently, for the EXCELLENT Mission: Impossible series to be among them.  I couldn't understand why it was consistently overlooked!  I had no idea it was because of the sub-standard movies that had recently been cranked out!  Why the producers of the movies would think that DVD's of the series would adversely effect ticket sales is beyond me...unless they knew their products were inferior in comparison."
dvd,,4.0,Rock to Smooth Jazz,"My favorite songs on this DVD are 'East Wes', 'Cliffs of Dover', and 'Zap' because of exceptional guitar work. 'Desert Rose' has an outstanding instrumental part and 'Camel's Night Out' is also noteworthy . He plays with intensity with an arsenal of vintage pedals. 'East Wes' has a hint of the thumb strummed Montgomery octaves and some well executed artificial harmonics but mostly it's just a beautiful piece of guitar music. This live version of 'Cliffs of Dover' differs significantly from the recorded version. It's more of a Malmsteen influenced approach preferring the monster run to the super precise lick of the recording. There are even minor flubs in this version which says to me 'Cliffs' might have been take 15. The way Eric plays with technical proficiency and nuance is a tough act for any guitarist to follow. I've practiced his recorded version of 'Cliffs' for 2 years for ie. and it's still a crap shoot every time I play it. Another point to remember is the tone he so meticulously achieves. I'd call it 'articulated bagpipes'. I wonder if 'Line 6' has modeled him yet ? Starting with his Strat; point one is the 12 inch radius neck. It's not your typical stratocaster neck. It's more of a jazz neck,(flatter and wider than a typical 9 1/2 inch radius strat neck}. He  uses just a little bit of distortion preferring the true tone of his guitar and amps speaking of which,(the guitar) has the thinnest of finishes so the tone of the wood can come through. This is atypical of your typical strat which has multiple layers of lacquer on the body and neck muting the instruments tone. He uses vintage 1950's electronics and pick-ups because many modern pick-ups are either heavily waxed or in the case of noiseless pickups,(actually thin humbucking pick-ups). They also rob tone,(remember strats are noise cancelling naturally in positions 2 and 4 so noiseless pickups are not really necessary. To go a giant step further Eric uses no ground connections on his amps or effects because he believes they invite dirty power,(also electricution).High end AC power conditioners/regenerators supposedly accomplish the same thing but they retail for over two thousand bucks a piece, are heavy(90lbs) and have amperage limits(usually 800), so he'd need 4 or 5 of them. His effect pedals must be at a certain height and I'm sure he would use battery power if it were feasable,(for his amplification). Eric picks his descending licks starting with an upstroke which is significant in that it allows better string muting,(I don't know why but it just does), and supposedly 'pops' the note out better, loves the dynamic of shifting from shimmering classical sounding chords back to his signature lead tone ... this device is used in 'Cliffs' to nice effect. The bass player is given a short solo( C.W.) which leads into 'Camel's Night Out'. 'C.W.' is a cliched lick repeated at fast tempo with some variation. I did not hear quite ENOUGH variation in that riffage to spark my interest. From a compositional standpoint it could have been fleshed out more but if all he got was a minute, perhaps there's only so much you can do in that timeframe. He's no Jaco but he ain't shabby either. I had a similar reaction to 'Steve's Boogie' which again sounded truncated and lacking. In it's entirety this dvd is worth the price if you want to see a famous, rich and very pretty guy improvise on guitar with an emphasis on speed & tone. Oh yeah, he sings too "
dvd,23 of 27,4.0,W-H-I-P-L-A-S-H,"Folks, this movie is alright, it's not THAT BAD.  Probably the best-worded review I've read for ""Ken Park"" so far is on IMDB.COM.  I think someone named ""peedur"" wrote it or something.  Not that I agree with him 100%, but the good that can be taken out of this film is well expressed in his critique."
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Compelling World War II Drama,"In early 2002, movie audiences were still getting acquainted Irish newcomer Colin Farrell.  On the same token, they were also quite familiar with Bruce Willis' acting credentials.  Putting the two of them together in a racially charged World War II drama would seem an unlikely mixture.  Farrell was already establish his bad boy credentials in Hollywood and Bruce Willis, despite a recent renaissance with films like ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", was still being remembered mostly as `Mr. Joe Actionhero' from movies like ""Die Hard"".  As strange as this combination would seem, actors and story, the resulting ""Hart's War"" turns out to be surprisingly good film.  "
dvd,13 of 15,4.0,"How often, O Lord? How often?","With some reservations after reading other reviews of this DVD, I went ahead and bought it, and I liked the workout much better than I expected. It's like the old joke about smashing one's head repeatedly against a wall: it feels so good when you stop! What another reviewer wrote is certainly true: some of the exercises probably work a lot better on the beach (where Mr. Kirsch and his team work out on the DVD) than they do on floors, where most of us work out. The only way I could do that ""mountain-climbing"" exercise was to take off my shoes, so that my sweat-socked feet could slide along the carpeted floor; but then I had to stop twice, once to remove the shoes and again to put them back on. I have two criticisms of my own that I don't think anyone has mentioned. One is the lack of ""modifiers"" for people with back and knee problems. The other is no mention of how often the program is to be performed. I listened carefully, even on the ""informercial"" part of DVD, and also read the SOUND MIND, SOUND BODY book, and am still in the dark. Usually programs involving weights require a rest day between exercise sessions, to give the muscles a chance to recuperate and rebuild; but since this program involves light weights, should one do it daily? Has anyone else asked this question, or maybe caught something I missed?"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Gripping movie,"Verhoeven's last Dutch movie was made out of spite. Increasingly lambasted for his films in his native Holland for being too perverted and desperate to make the move to Hollywood, this was the movie he made to show off potential executives in the USA. There were movie offers that he was interested in, in America, but due to one reason or another, he ended up frustrated with the whole process of waiting."

dvd,,5.0,makes you sweat,I love this workout. It makes me sweat every time. You can also adjust your sweat level by amping up the moves or toning them down to a more dance style. Minna is easy to follow and she has a fun personality. I do this workout at least three times a week. There are 2 workouts on here and both are equally chanllenging. Do both in one session if you really want to sweat. This is currently my favorite along with my belly dance workouts. I highly recommend this dvd to anybody.

Each tour from U2 is a gift and this DVD is an excellent way to remember! The tour is captured well -- great footage and sound. Thanks U2 for providing your fans with so much material to enjoy when you're not around."

dvd,2 of 4,4.0,PRETTY FUNNY STUFF,"This movie is geared for party goers.  But, you can still enjoy it even if you're not.  As a script writer, I've seen a lot of scripts go through Hollywood.  One thing this movie script has, it is different and that is what makes it good.  It's not the same boring stuff that you see come across your desk every day.  It takes a trained eye and a good writer to find scripts that are unique.  I read a review on BioDome on Apollo Movie Guide by Ryan Cracknell.  He bashed this movie up and down.  I can't understand why because it has some good qualities.  I read other reviews that he has done and found that Ryan Cracknell has the inablility to write good reviews.  He lacks focus and his narrow minded thinking leaves him behind good writers for he has never had anything worth while produced.  If you take the advise of Ryan Cracknell regarding Bio Dome, then you will be missing out on quite a lot.  He is just one bad writer.  There are other good writers out there that do good reviews.  I think you will like this movie.   "
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,"Brilliance And Courage, Then And Now","It's almost impossible to set too much praise on this movie. Harkening back to an age when those who delivered the evening news were true reporters instead of image-obsessed actors reading mindlessly off a screen, this film tells in shades of metaphor the events behind the courageous crusade of CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow to expose the cruel campaign of ruinous muckraking and induced paranoia then Senator Joseph McCarthy, Republican, Wisconsin, was waging beneath the guise of keeping America safe from covert Communist intrusion. Murrow risked everything, his reputation, livelihood, his very liberty, to reveal the actions of the man who unwillingly gave his name to a form of witch hunt: ""McCarthyism."" Murrow was a true hero of freedom and a journalistic icon. His dedication to the craft of investigative journalism was rare for his time and is sadly all-but unknown in this day and age. His was an era when television news was listened to instead of watched, and his insights into the drear possibility of the future of television and society, spoken right at the start of the picture, have come grimly true in the 2000's. Whatever may be said of George Clooney as an actor, he shows brilliance as a director and I hope Goodnight And Good Luck, this black and white masterpiece of skilled acting and intelligent writing, is but the first of many fine, thought-provoking films yet to come from him"

I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing"

dvd,,4.0,Next Best Thing To Being There and Meeting Them,"This DVD serves as a good introduction to the Michalka sisters. Their songs are beautiful and sound much better than concert video clips taken by fans. These girls serve as excellent role models of how youth could and should act. Their attire is conservative; their lyrics meaningful and clean; their performance simple. Each song has a positive message. Although they are very personable, talking to the audience and touching many of the fans' outreaching hands, the audience seemed not quite with it. One of the more impressive songs consisted of just the two sitting, singing, and playing their guitars. As a parent, I would recommend this DVD for any girl between 9 and 15. Younger children will not appreciate the lyrics and older kids will want harder rock music"

Even with the advent of computer generated images and improved techniques for classic animation, the old Disney art presents a certain character and feel that I prefer over the newest animation. I've watched this multiple times with my 2 year old cousin and he enjoys it quite a bit.  It's a classic that follows the tradition of films such as Lady and the Tramp, the Sword in the Stone, and Robin Hood"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,"Scattered at times, but a great start to Tyler's big screen career","When this movie came out, I was very much against it. Another man in a fat suit? Didn't we already have a little too much of Eddie Murphy in his second Nutty Professor flick? And Martin Lawrence working the fat suit too? A couple of women friends of mine saw this movie, and I ended up going to see Madea's Family Reunion in the theatre and being very pleasantly surprised. I finally got around to seeing this on DVD and I have to give props to Tyler for having enough vision to take his ""chitlin circuit"" musicals to the big screen."
dvd,15 of 15,5.0,Outstanding Production on Every Level!,"My six year old boy Tyler and my three year old girl Emma can finally both sit and watch something together, enjoy it, and learn from it.  This DVD has it all...great production value, a wonderful storyline, and truly high caliber music worthy of Disney.  Tyler and Emma love singing along and now know all the lyrics and all the dialogue!  Very informative and has motivated our whole family to go to the planetarium to see and learn more.  A definite must-have!!!"

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,thumbs up,"I was using this for only one week (doing it everyday) and my stomache is getting so much flatter and tighter.  If you are not used to excercising it will be a real tough workout but you will get used to it if you keep with it, and it's fun once you get the hang of it"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Rock 'n Roll Film,"One night, the band of teens rolls through East L.A. in search of drugs, leading to a confrontation with a Latino dealer, Hector. Intrigued by his cool head in the face of danger, Allison and her best friend Emily revisit this neighborhood to learn more about him and his way of life.They quickly run into trouble when they befriend an East LA gang, spiraling their lives of luxury into a dark storm of violence and desperation.Bijou Phillips has proven that she can be a fascinating sexual force on screen.The story revolves around a group of white, rich and, spoiled high school students who form a gang to spike their dull lives of privilege."

The princess gets an education in proper royal behavior & procedures. The Queen learns to loosen up and relax. Princess Mia also struggles between dating the school jock, who ignored her before she became famous and dating an unpopular guy who has been her friend for years."
dvd,10 of 12,5.0,The Indisputable Kurosawa Masterwork Given Worthy Criterion Treatment,"Leave it to the Criterion Collection to give Akira Kurosawa's seminal 1950 masterpiece its due with this superb 2002 DVD package. First, renowned Japanese film scholar Donald Richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other Japanese genres, Yasujiro Ozu's family drama, ""Early Summer"" (1951), and K� Ichiwara's sun-tribe melodrama, ""Crazed Fruit"" (1956). Second, there is a seventeen-minute excerpt about the film from a feature-length documentary about its masterful cinematographer, ""World of Kazuo Miyagawa"", who did similarly amazing work on Kenji Mizoguchi's ""Ugetsu"" (1953) and Ozu's ""Floating Weeds"" (1959). Third, if you choose to buy rather than rent the DVD, there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from Kurosawa's autobiography and the two short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa from which Kurosawa and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto based their screenplay. Add a brief testimonial introduction by Robert Altman, and this becomes one of the best of the Criterion Collection DVDs."

For some dunb ass reason people that film so many shows do NOT GET IT!  we fans do NOT want to see a bunch of camera shots back and forth of the crowd!!

Keep the cameras on the SHOW!  and DONT change from one camera to another every 5 SECONDS!  that pisses me off too to no end.   learn this, watch Roger Waters DVD in the flesh, learn learn LEARN!!!!!!!!!!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Time to Kill,If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you.  It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause
dvd,3 of 3,2.0,Don't Get Me Wrong...,"I feel I should preface by saying that I love this band to death. However, For Fans Only is pretty shoddy. Every negative comment listed below is pretty valid and probably more bothersome then one would expect. That being said, it's not without merit. I just wish it had been put together better"
dvd,0 of 10,5.0,A Good Dance Instructional Video!,"You Got Served:Take It to the Streets is the off the chain and great. It shows you what they was dancing off the movie and the dancers is Kristi Crader,the two main stars Omarion Grandberry,Marques Houston,Dante Harper,Robert Hoffman,Christopher Jones,Tanee McCall,Meme Miles,Diona Robinson, Richard Steelo Vasquez,Harry Shum Jr.,Isaiah Vest,Ivan 'Flipz' Velez,the two main choreographers Dave Scott and Shane Sparks and the rest of the cast and crew of the dance instructional movie did a good job on the dance instructional film"
dvd,,2.0,Plot is absurd; acting is fine,"So: alien civilizations with obviously vastly superior technology travel clear across the galaxy at speeds greater than the speed of light in order to--well, won't give the plot away, but trust me, they're not here to guests on Martha Stewart. And I find the plot, therefore, and all of these ""aliens as terror sources"" movies just--can I say this?--not fair to aliens!  OK, I don't have an aluminum foil hat on, I just think its childish. Stephen Greer, MD's ""Hidden Truth"" book suggests that this is the sort of fare we are to get from Hollywood--no more friendly E.T. types, just constantly the message of terror from the skies. This trend in cinema about foreign visitors is now so consistent that it just makes movies like this dull and predictable. And how we eventually beat back the aliens in this movie? Oh, you don't want to know.."
dvd,5 of 19,5.0,great great great!!!!!,This movies is soooo great ...and Im not even gay! I bought this movie after constant repeats on Cinamax while I and a friend were drunk and on not so legal drugs  we ordered this move because of its greatness. Crawford is a hero to us all! And Stig ia the most perfect and classicx of all movie villians. This mo0vie is one ofnther greatest movies ever made...move over Citizen Kane here comes real cinima!!!!!!!!!!
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Surreal and Hallucinatory; The Coens' Best Film,"In this film from the Coen brothers, the titular character, Barton Fink (John Turturro) travels from his liberal New York enclave where he wrote about ""the common man"" from a comfortable distance to a dumpy hotel outside Los Angeles, where he wrestles with a common man. Fink is brought out after getting positive reviews on Broadway and is put to work writing a wrestling picture which proves beyond his abilities--fooling the upper crust about the average Joe is one thing, but it's significantly tougher to fool actual common men into thinking he knows them. Fink seeks out assistance from the Faulkner-esque writer W. P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), which turns out to be a futile maneuver, and finally winds up getting some inspiration from his hotel neighbor Charlie (John Goodman), who might or might not be a serial killer who likes to lop off his victims' heads."
dvd,,2.0,Wasn't what I expected...,This film was not what I expected. It was so plain. I was about ready to turn it off. 
dvd,,2.0,"The details are wrong, the big picture is inexistant",The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.  
dvd,13 of 13,5.0,Buy the DVD instead of the CD,"I eagerly awaited the release of Any Given Thursday, because I am a big fan of John Mayer's and had seen him live in April 2002 (at a House of Blues) and again in August 2002, just 4 weeks before the concert recorded. My big decision was whether to buy the CD or the DVD. "
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,Batman AND moviegoers finally get the film they deserve..,"I can't add much more to what everyone else has already said except to say that I totally love this film, and it is  one of the best comic/superhero films of all time, much less the BEST silver-screen representation of Batman. None of the other films can even touch this one. "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A Lot Better Than The Book Version In My Opinion...,"I watched this movie as a favorite for a long while and then decided to read the book- and I realized after a few chapters how different the book is to the movie. And yet that is a good thing- since the book version is to me so very isolating and dull, while the movie is heart- warming friendship- comedy type of story which makes it a lot better. So yes- if you are planning to read the book- don't expect it to be at all like the movie, and I don't recommend the book at all."
dvd,4 of 10,4.0,Thoroughly Engaging! Expresses True Spirit of the Book!,"The film begins with gripping scenes and haunting music ... Fighter jets landing, powerful spiritual music that is sad and almost like a funeral - setting the tone for what is to come. Ben Affleck plays the CIA agent Jack Ryan to perfection. There is great casting for all the major roles and key characters in the book. Although in the book, the city of Denver is the location used by terrorists for the attack, the choice of Baltimore, Maryland makes sense, since there is a port which clearly can be the point of entry for contraband. The fact is the film remains true to the intentions and spirit of Tom Clancy's book. There is political maneuvering, espionage, edge-of-your seat gripping moments after the attack and a very well executed plot. Suspense builds and the story unfolds ... The topic is fascinating and timely. It is almost like the ""007"" films of old ... You more or less know what to expect, but the ride is so engaging, you are caught up in the drama and events."
dvd,2 of 7,5.0,JP2=The Best. / JP1=The 2nd Best / JP3=The Third Best,"I say that Jurassic Park 2; The Lost World is the absolute best of the three because everything about it is perfect, Jurassic Park 1 is almost as good as the second, and Jurassic Park 3 is Ok. I love the Lost World because of extreme scenes like the San Diego rampage scene"

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Excellent pianist, miserable photography","This is a great DVD, with great sound, and an impressive performance.  Yundi Li's technique is seemingly effortless, and his mastery of the piano are outstanding, especially at his age at the performance.  There are very few mistakes (adjacent notes touched) that would be noticed only by a listener who has memorized the works performed.  His tempi are reasonable, although occasionally hurried, but not so out-of-control as with Martha Argerich, and not slumped as Claudio Arrau's.  His overall performance is awsome. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Commentary,"Although a flawed film, the DVD is wll worth having for the commentary by three Peckinpah historians alone. Beyond sharing background anecdotes, they highlight features that reveal both its strengths and weaknesses, a help even for those still learning how to see a film"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,4months pregnant and loving it,"I have some of Rodney Yee's other videos and I have to agree with everyone else that it is totally different. Most of the poses are repeated 3x which means the stretches actually are pretty beneficial and you advance further with each repetition. The first half contains the only ""burn"" part which is an extended downward dog with modifications; the rest is a nice wind down. I am pregnant and bought this with CRUNCH's pregnancy yoga video, I actually like this a lot better and other than the boat pose am able to do most of the poses just fine, and it's much more interesting and challenging than the pregnancy one. He is right, it is easier to focus on the breathing more when you do the poses slowly and they are done with a nice flow to them which is great."
dvd,9 of 10,4.0,Good,I really liked this video. I was looking for a BASIC stretch video and this was it. It is a good length 40min total and she explains the stretches well. great to use a few times  a week for a deeper stretch. NOT YOGA..just basic athletic type stretche
dvd,,4.0,Jerry Maguire,I think Rod Tidwell may as well make his wife his agent. His wife seems to be more competent at negotiations than Jerry.
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,John Waters is back,"Although ""Cecil B. Demented"" was not a bad movie, it was not near as good as Waters' best films. But do not worry. John Waters is back with ""A Dirty Shame"". "
dvd,,5.0,Best Show On Television,Veronica Mars is one of the best shows ever. When i bought this DVD i was so excited that when it arrived i started watching it straight away. it took me about 3 days to watch it all. It is one of the best shows on television. Bell is a terriffic actress along with all co-stars. Great summer watching if you love teen shows
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,The perfect movie for deployed military members,"This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. ""Ground Hog Day"" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here."
dvd,1 of 7,5.0,Review of The Jungle Book,The movie was received in good condition within the specified time fram
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excelent purchase,"Excelent episodes, I remember when I saw them for the first time in TV and I wondered myself: How could I get this episodes for me and can watch them over and over again...well, this is the solution...buy it here!"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Good movie,The action in this movie is amazing. The idea behind the movie is great. Actors are great. This movie is great as a date movie.
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Just enjoy it on its own terms; it is one of the masterpieces of cinema,"With 165 Amazon reviews available to date, perhaps there is little another can add. Let me suggest in review 166 that the viewer simply surrender to this film and let it work its extraordinary enticement. Too many of the reviews, in my opinion accurately, address the weaknesses and contradictions of the plot, the racism of Ethan, the anti-hero hero, and the weakness of a few of the episodes and of a few of the actors. I respect those assessments but feel that they miss the point; the film works at very level of involvement."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Best of 2006,"""Cars"" is the inventive, creative, and entertaining automated film of the year.  Plugging into America's love with the automobile the producers offer a timeless tale that is destined to become a cult classic.  This action packed show speaks volumes through the roar, rumble, romance and racing of hotrods, race cars, and sweet rides."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"Cubic, cubist, cuban, who knows in this cubicle?","Vincenzo Natali is the worthy descendant of Cronenberg. He invents a model of our psyche in which we are, everyone of us, locked up in a cube that is the universe of our consciousness. We are thus psychotic since the outside world does not exist. And yet the master of this world has set six windows, one on each side, all around us. We can open them, one at a time, and get out into another cube that has to be the psyche of someone else. But this trip is very dangerous. There might be a trap in that other cube, a trap set by the other or by the supermaster of the universe. We may be killed and die instantly. Hence we enjoy and find a sweet and soft refuge in our own psychosis. But sooner or later someone will come into our cube or we will get into another cube where we will find someone else. The drama of meeting with others will start as a competition to find a way out if there is one. But we will discover very fast that all the cubes of all the individuals of the world are all connected within an even bigger cube but that the various cubes are constantly moving. And yet there is a way out and we must find it. We are little by little becoming schizophrenic. And the elimination of the others becomes the objective that erases the possible escape from this world that we may have caressed for a while. Terminate the others, and fast please. To escape this world we need two qualities. First to be able to mentally and spiritually feel, sense and grasp the wider scope and scheme that is behind this cube, these cubes, and we then can see the red thread that is going to lead us to the exit. And we need to be attached to absolutely no one, or even to get rid of all those who could become attached to you or to whom you may get attached. These two qualities are autistic characteristics, but it is generally considered in our society as a disease if not some retardation. Thence we shrink in front of the others and we go back to our cocoonic psychosis that is more comfortable than this schizophrenia. Who controls this world ? Is it God ? But then what about divine love ? Is it the most pathetic human invention ever put forward, not to speak of a pure folly that we have spread among human animals like a retrovirus that turned these animals into self-declared human beings ? Please wait for the end and step out of this cubic film to recapture some sanity."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Dr. Katz made me happy,Nothing like a little therapy from D. Katz and crew to get through the day
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Geronimo!,This movie was absolutely great. Mel Gibson is hilarious in this film. He usually tends to overact but in this movie it fits in perfectly. I guarantee you'll laugh at some of the scenes in this movie. Julia Roberts plays her role great along with all the other characters. The movie has an interesting plot with conspiracies and paranoia. It's very entertaining
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,Disappointing Is A Compliment,"I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast"
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,The Best Trilogy Ever!!!,"X-Men, X-Men United and X-Men ""The Last Stand"" are simply spectacular! The cast,the characters, the special effects, the story, the action scenes,and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever!!!.I have seen lots of movies in my life, but nothing compares and comes close to X-Men. "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,An Unrecognized Classic,"""Santa Claus, The Movie"" is a film that my family and I watch every year at Christmas. As time goes on, I am sure it will be recognized as one of the all-time classic yuletide movies. As a Child of the 80's, this movie holds a special place in my heart, and only the presence of the superb ""One Magic Christmas"" (both from 1985) prevents me from giving ""Santa Claus"" 5 stars."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Hardest film I've ever seen,Irreversible sparked my interest because several politicians in Australia wanted to have it banned here. I wanted to know why I shouldn't be allowed to see this film. 
dvd,20 of 23,5.0,Alternative Expressions Of Fact: A Puzzle Without Solution,"Somewhat curiously, Japanese critics were not enthusiastic about RASHOMON when it was released in 1950 Japan.  Today, however, RASHOMON is generally considered to be the film that introduced both master director Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to the west; it is also often cited as the film that prompted The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to create an award for Best Foreign Language film.  It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Labyrinth - fantasy and fun,"The Labyrinth is a delightful movie of fantasy and fun for all ages to enjoy.  This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen."
dvd,16 of 20,2.0,Not for photographers.,"If you are expecting great insight into the lives of National Geographic's photographers or even revelations about what makes great photography then look elsewhere. This video greatly disappointed me as it is nothing more than promotional drivel. So fawning and servile is the narration that each sentence sounds as if it is about to collapse under the weight of the compliments for the organization. It reminds me of these terrible ""the making of..."" TV programs the have now to promote movies. It should be given free with subscriptions and not charged for. It is short and shallow and holds about 15 minutes in total interest for any photographer. Buy the magazine or one of their books instead."
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,A DVD set befitting this significant milestone!,"The last Platoon DVD had some impressive extras, most notably two audio commentaries and a retrospective making of documentary. These have been included along with several additional featurettes and deleted scenes."
dvd,4 of 7,4.0,i like it........,"I did'nt know anything about what this movie was about,"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,THE BEST VERSION OF CINDERELLA!!,"Lesley Ann Warren's winsome portrayal is a winner here!  This is THEEEE version of the timeless fairy tale you want to get.  I remember when I was growing up looking forward to the annual showing of this classic, just like 'The Wizard of Oz'.  I absolutely loved it then and time has not changed my opinion.  It has even improved with age.  The cast is perfection with a young Stuart Damon as the dashing, handsome prince, Ginger Rogers as the regal Queen, Walter Pidgeon as the king with the dry wit, Jo Van Fleet as the haughty stepmother, Barbara Ruick as Esmerelda, the stepsister with the batty eyes and Pat Carroll as Prunella (what a name for a character), the other nasty stepsister who manages to steal every scene she's in.  The scene where she's trying on the slipper is a howler!!  And let's not forget Celeste Holm as the epitome of goodness as the fairy godmother.  Oh, and the music???  My favorite is ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"" and you'll find yourself singing along to ""Impossible"", ""In My Own Little Corner"", ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"", ""Ten Minutes Ago"", ""A Lovely Night""...and all the rest.  There is a charming fifteen minute retrospective featuring a much more mature Lesley Ann Warren who considers this film as a ""Gift"" to her career, (a now sadly bloated and yellow teethed) Stuart Damon and a still regal Celeste Holm reminiscing beautifully about this labor of love.  I love this version because it is beautiful!! "
dvd,5 of 14,1.0,Playable in the U.S.A.???,"I wish I could write a review espousing the merits of this movie which I'm sure it probably deserves due to the subject matter and caliber of the cast... but I can't. Before you order this, you may want do some research to confirm if this latest DVD version is ""Region 1"" playable. I'm returning the one I've just ordered."
dvd,13 of 13,5.0,Recipe for a classic ," Let's see - take a whiskey drummer, add a boozy doctor (served in the Union Army,) a snaky gambler (Confederate vet played by John Carradine,) a good girl (haughty young wife of a horse soldier posted out west with the 6th Cavalry,) and an obnoxious and imperious businessman with a secret to hide.  Add one bad girl (Claire Trevor) driven our of town with the drunken doc by the town's respectable marm hens, and one cuffed outlaw, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne.)  Shake vigorously in a stagecoach plunging violently through hostile Apache territory."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,TV Show Out-Movies the Movies--OUTSTANDING,"Okay, if a TV show can be this good, why can't Hollywood, with its gargantuan budget, come anywhere close in terms of acting, script, cinematography, or give viewers the sheer joy of watching a complex plot unfold with over a dozen deep and conflicted characters?  The answer--because Hollywood doesn't take risks.  This show never should have been a success, according to the Establishment, whose philosophy is: Go with the sure thing.  Has there been one original movie in the last two years?  If so, better make twenty more just like it, say the film companies.  It seems like every mainstream movie anymore is a rip-off of a teenage sex comedy, a crime thriller, a car-chase show, or a drama about disfunctional, unrealistic, and unlikeable families.  As for the TV market, the prevailing view seems to be 'why pay actors high salaries when you can find idiots to be on reality television for free?'"

dvd,12 of 13,5.0,A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE: CRITERION EDITION ,"Thank you Criterion! This wonderful DVD presented by Criterion is the one to purchase. Having owned the masterworks DVD, I can state without any hesitation that this is the one to have. I don't think I need to go into the film, with so many wonderful reviews already here at amazon. However, if there are any of you who were deciding which to buy--then it is the CRITERION DVD. The story of Shakespeares King Lear is all too familiar with many already. Those who have not seen this film, go out and rent it today. This is a wonderful film that I would love to watch with my wife in a movie theatre some day. Highly, highly recommended. Enjoy this wonderful masterpiece of cinematic beauty! "

dvd,16 of 17,4.0,Repeat After Me,"If you've been following along this series by DVD, as I have, episodes 15 thru 18 will be something of a disappointment.  They are a reprise of the story up to this point, and nothing more.  That might work for the TV audience, for which much time has passed, but for someone who just watched the third DVD last week it's an unexpected delay in an otherwise compelling series."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,HE SEES YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING,"Twenty years ago Alexander Salkind who masterminded the SUPERMAN movies decided to go all out with the Santa Claus legend.  The result is a magical, picturesque movie with lots of elf dancing and pretty scenery, with little coherence in its plot. But what the heck---David Huddleston is one of the best embodiments of the jolly old soul and John Lithgow chews up the scenery as the nasty toymaker.  It's a fun family film with a delightful score by the late Henry Mancini and even pixiie-ish Dudley Moore does okay.  It reminds us of the magic of believing and what the secular meaning of Christmas is supposed to be. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Halloween...a classic.,"When I was about 10 years old, I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's house when there was a sleepover. It was the scariest thing I have ever seen. Even since then, it has been my favorite horror movie or dare I say my favorite movie of all time? I think so. It's a classic. When I bought it on DVD i expected a bare bones edition with nothing besides the movie. I was wrong. I was shocked when I saw a documentary including interviews with John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Jamie Lee Curtis and P.J. Soles, among many others. I was pleasantly surprised at the director's commentary as well. I usually don't watch films with the commentary on because I find it ruins the film, but...I'm so fascinated with this film I had to see with. I highly recommened this film for anyone, horror fan or not"
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Fishing With John,"""Fishing With John"" makes fun of fishing shows while still actually being a fishing show. It mocks itself as much as it does the form. It is aimless and yet knows full well what it is doing. It is brilliant in that it never really tries to be. These contrasts are just a few reasons why ""Fishing With John"" is such a great watch. Six episodes may not seem like much, but really it's just enough, and at any rate, the price is certainly right"
dvd,3 of 7,4.0,Another fine Fred Astaire film...!,"A brisk, enjoyable Fred Astaire flick, which features Fred and Red Skelton as the prolific Depression-era songwriting team of Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, who wrote standards such as &quot;Whose Sorry Now,&quot; &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You,&quot; known for its &quot;boop-oop-a-doop&quot; refrain, sung by squeeky-voiced Helen Kane.  Astaire and Skelton play things pretty low-key in this straightforward potboiler; Skelton is particularly likeable with his big-lug interpretation of Ruby's personality and Astaire... Well, he's just Astaire, which is to say he's great -- wish maybe he'd danced a bit more in this one. The music is nice too, especially when they sing as a duet; the movie's only downside is the drab female leads, Arlene Dahl and Vera-Ellen, both of whom are a bit dull, and don't sing that well. All in all, though, an entertaining, pleasantly nostalgic film, well worth checking out"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Encino Man,"The concept is, of course, totally unrealistic, that a caveman could be frozen for thousands of years, and still survive when thawed out. But that doesn't stop the viewer from having a great time watching. It takes a little while to understand Pauly Shore's Encino slang, but he definitely steals the show. Trivia note: the mother (Mariette Hartley) played the part of an ice age woman in the old Star Trek TV show. She was the woman that rescued Bones and Spock from the cold, and Spock fell in love with her"
dvd,4 of 16,4.0,****Something to be aware of. Possible Spoilers.****,"While the problem was not severe enough to warrant a return, my disc broke up into little squares for 20 seconds on one side, and for a few seconds on the other side. Momentary loss of sound, too. This problem went from one person's dialogue to another upon rewinding and playback. Double-sided discs should be banned because of quality concerns. I'm not sure weather my 2 Sony Players do not read them correctly, or weather this a defect in the disc. I had a similar situation with Jane Eyre (1983), BBC Warner also. I have rarely had a problem with the Warner otherwise. One episode of The Dukes of Hazzard stopped and then started again without breaking up. ***On the other hand, I have returned a Warner DVD only once. ""Rush Hour 2"" by New Line Cinema. 2 DVD's of this title were defective because of constant, unwatchable, breaking up of the picture. This caused the sound be distorted as well.**"

dvd,3 of 4,5.0,"Wonderful, Effortless, Intimate Show From Incubus","Brandon Boyd &amp; Co. really shine on &quot;The Morning View Sessions&quot;. Don't let the name of this DVD fool you... it's not a &quot;making of the album&quot; feature. This is an actual 12-song set at a very small venue. The intimate setting is much more pleasing to the camera eye - as you feel you're practically on stage as Brandon sings, Mike Enziger plays guitar, and the rest of Incubus plays along effortlessly. Incubus makes it look so incredibly easy - these kids are California professionals in my book - masters at their craft. Picture quality is superb, camera angles are great and they change at just the right pace (those who have recently seen Kiss's Melbourne Symphony DVD know what I'm talking about in regards to the acute headaches and nausea encountered due to the high frame rate change every 2 seconds). This DVD features 12 songs - taken from their 3 previous releases (prior to 2002), &quot;Morning View&quot;, &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;. There are two acoustic songs featuring Brandon &amp; Mike on stage along (performing the songs &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot;) that are simply wonderful. There is some additional footage of some of the behind-the-scenes recording of &quot;The Morning View&quot; album from a Malibu mansion, as well as the video &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (and the making-of the video). This is a great way to kill an hour or so. Incubus is great to listen to as well as watch on your TV (not to mention being there in person). Excellent"
dvd,,4.0,Brrrr!,"This movie features two amazing stories--the lifestyle of the Emperor Penguin, which I was somewhat familiar with from children's books, and the untold story of ""how in the world did they make this movie"", which features footage from the coldest, windiest, most storm-ravaged place on the planet, Antartica.  At least the filmmakers got to leave at some point. By the will of God or evolution, penguins continue to struggle to maintain the species in the face of the harshest of elements"
dvd,,1.0,An unconvenient truth,"  When the scientific facts about climate change are seriously looked into the only inconvenient truth is Vice President Gore needs to find another celebrity cause.  A passionate speaker can sway many people that are already leaning towards a given theory.  It quickly becomes evident that once the predicted ice age of the late '70s and early '80s didn't pan out the only direction to go was the opposite or global warming. What should cause most people to pause and think is that when the noise dies down the only solution to global warming given by it's theorists is to vote for a certain political party.  Sorry, nice try Al. Perhaps if you spent more time cleaning up the heavy metal pollution found on your own property you would convince more people"

dvd,8 of 8,4.0,Good Male AND Female characters,"This was good for BOTH boys AND girls. The female main character, for once, was a real character, as opposed to a love interest. And when she fought, she actually fought as opposed to ""fought sexily."" And the energy between the two characters was unique and kinda sweet. Add all the wizards, explosions, troll-like villans and pretty well-done fights and you've got a decent mix. The only complaint I had was that the only other female character was dead. What of both of the main characters' mother's too"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Yet another Bergman masterwork....,"This is a masterwork.  Bergman managed, somehow, to top himself yet again with this extraordinary miniseries.  It is a brutally honest, painful, funny (yes, funny), and depressing portrayal of a marriage disintegrating, getting back together, truly disintegrating, and finally, near the end, coming to somewhat of a reconciliation, even though it's more of a realisation than anything.  It's not a tidy little wrapup you're used to in American TV/film.  It is simply the story of a marriage between Johann and Marianne.  There are many highlights, such as the dialogue in which Johann goes off on women and feminism in episode two.  It is hilarious and quite truthful.  But the best episode is episode five, when Johann and Mrianne finally sign the divorce papers.  Marianne is much more assertive and independent, and Johann is meek and bitter.  Marianne lashes into him with every emotion she can muster.  Johann eventually breaks out into a pity party, then gets physically violent.  Johann was the one who left Marianne for another woman in episode three, leaving Marianne devastated.  It turns out that Johann's affair didn't turn out as he expected, and he's turned out to be the meeker of the two, and he doesn't like it.  This is such a contrast to the feel good, phony advice that TV gurus, sitcoms, and countless ""how to figure out men and women"" authors dish out in this country.  Relationships are extraordinarily complex things, and here Bergman dives into it like no other filmmaker has.  Only Catherine Breillat comes close to the real issues that exist between the sexes as Bergman does here.  I, like many others, initially saw only the theatrical version (and it was dubbed in English as well).  I also saw it when I was around 19 or 20, so I didn't really get it.  I watched it because it was ""intellectual"", I guess.  But seeing it now, and having open my eyes to the world a little wider, I really appreciate it.   Thanks to Criterion, I've seen the miniseries version, and it is far superior (like Bergman's Fanny and Alexander) to the cut version.  And it plays better on a television, with the full framing intact (the theatrical version is matted).  The penetrating closeups of faces really make this extraordinarily intimate telefilm/film/miniseries.  You must see the entire series, as opposed to the edited film (while good, it still doesn't get at the heart of the series).  If you really want to figure out men and women (or come as close as you probably ever will), see this miniseries.  You still won't help you figure out men and women in a permanent sense, but it will help you understand things a bit better.  Bergman is a master filmmaker, one of the best this world has ever given us.  "

dvd,,4.0,The Graduate 2,"""Rumor"" is a good movie, but you definately need to see ""The Graduate"" first - or the movie just won't reach its potential.  Kevin Costner is great once again and Jennifer Aniston gives what could be her best performance to date."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,An action thriller that's actually thrilling.,"Even though some segments of Twister are a bit unrealistic, that's ok. The action and special effects are spectacular and the acting and character development are great. From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. This isn't a documentary, so there are plenty of scenes presented for dramatic effect. That's ok by me. This is a fun, intense, emotional movie full of everything a disaster movie needs. Right up there with The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, Twister will keep you in your seat, following every chase"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The Changeling,"Very good and scary movie.  Saw years ago on video, DVD makes it so much better.  Some say it's better watching it for a second time-you may miss some key facts the first time around.  One of my favorites! Highly recommended"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Great for what it is,"Not everybody has experience with babies. We haven't all had the opportunity to 'practice' with the children of friends and family. Some of us have never even touched a baby before, let lone changed, bathed or fed one. While I think this DVD is probably far too simplistic for the kind of woman who has spent her life cooing over baby pictures in magazines, for men like me who know NOTHING and are scared to death, it provides invaluable reassurance. Of course it can't replace in-depth books and pre-natal classes, but as an easy visual guide, I can't imagine how it could have been done any better."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Season two delivers more fun and more twists!,"If you loved the first one then you'll most likely want more!  The show is incredibly addicting, because it's so well done, fun dramatic writing and acting.  What's different with this season compared to the last one?  The actors have grown more into their characters, before it had made more teen angst; this one has more adult angst.  Sandy and Kirsten are by far still the central unit in The O.C., but even they begin to have some obstacles and troubles thrown into their rock solid relationship.  Kelly Rowan ""Kirsten"" does some of her most finest acting work for the show in this season, taking her character to dramatic heights noteworthy of critical appraisal.  Ryan ended the second half of the first season by becoming a little too meddling into everyone's affairs, and making bad relationship choices, but he then slowly gains a little bit of your trust on him again in the second season, by taking it down a notch.  Seth was once the most entertaining one has now become a little on the annoying side in this season.  You want him to stop rambling and back away, let the other characters shine.  Marissa's character actually gets better in season two; she becomes much edgier, a little more self aware and much cooler.  You get the feeling she is completely in tune with what's really up with everybody.  The gay rights activists should applaud ""The O.C."" and Mischa Barton for crossing the gay line to a huge teen audience in a positive way.  Julie was the ultimate villain in season one, now you almost feel like maybe she doesn't mean to be so bad, and actually does have heart, but then you hesitate to make that assumption, she teeters on that fine line of being good and being bad, making it all the more fun to watch! This season is darker, more drama, more twists, and more added characters to complicate matters, a definite must see if you enjoyed the first season"

dvd,4 of 5,4.0,Well told Soccer saga starring Kuno Becker,"Goal is a great modern day rags to riches sports story.  Santiago Munez leaves with his family to cross the border into the United States at a young age, leaving his homeland behind.  What he takes with him is a great skill and even greater passion to play the game of soccer (aka futbol).  When he gets older, he is noticed by a former player while playing with friends in a dirt lot.  The man soon sets things in motion for Santiago to come and try out for a team in England.  His father dismisses this, seeing it as a fools dream and is constantly upset with Santiago that he does not try harder to fit the role of provider by working in his soon to be very own landscape business."
dvd,3 of 9,1.0,Stick with Willy Wonka,"I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's ""performance"" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$"

Their response was overwhelmingly postive in that that understand 1st hand the wheels of justice and how it effcts young black men. They were dismayed at the fact that even when the correct perpetrator was apprehended, the white guy who 1st accused the defendant wsa adamant. The only gripe I have is the resolution of the civil case brought against the police and what the young man is up to today.."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,The series advances,"Chamber of Secrets is of course the adaptation of the second book in the successful Harry Potter series, and finds the gang at Hogwarts racing to uncover a great evil that has been released upon the students again. In terms of translating the book to film, 'Chamber' is much more successful than the original, if only because the story is more focused and there is a stronger, hands-on climax that gives Harry something to do. In comparison to the third and fourth films, Chamber of Secrets was also the last movie where major chunks of the original story were not cut out or re-written. There are bits missing, but they aren't as obvious. It also started the trend of the series taking on a darker tone, so parents might want to watch this one with younger kids."
dvd,10 of 30,5.0,Assinine Reviewers for The Mark Of Zorro(Colorized/B&W),"I support the studio's decision to colorize old films and they are doing an excellent job, Hello!, they are giving you a choice, they are not forcing you into only having the colorized versions, I am sick of all this boycott this studio, boycott that studio, are the studio's double dipping so to speak because they come up with better versions of the same film, the answer is no, these versions are improved(Exponentially) by the studio's investment(Their's not ours), and I hope they continue, I realize that all the vice ridden, women chasing reviewers who don't earn a decent wage are probably scrambling to afford a single DVD a week, but if you don't like colorized classic films turn the color off when you watch them STUPID!!, the studio's are making old films available that were never available before and I salute them, keep up the good work!"

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Great buns workout,"I had bought the original VHS tape in 1997, but my VCR broke.  I was upset because this buns workout is great and I thought that I would not be able to find it on DVD. If you don't like to get on the floor to do excercises then this is the tape for you.  Nothing is done on the floor and your buns will be ready for full bathing suit exposure. There are three basic excercise sections 1. In-line skating, 2. Kickboxing, and 3. Ballet.  Some excercises (kickboxing section) are difficult to learn and to balance, but with time, it will be worth it.  Just do the best you can in that section.  This DVD also has an ABS section, but I have not tried it yet.  Highly recommend this Buns of Steel"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,One of the very few movies that actually makes you laugh,"I just watched my new Ice Age DVD and was delighted.

I set the listening mode to 70mm and was very impressed with how good it sounded. I would guess the Dolby Digital soundtrack is awesome. The video transfer is gorgeous. I have waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD and I'm very happy to have this two-disc edition."

dvd,10 of 11,5.0,"""Ride With the Devil"" a very authentic gem","I grew up on a farm in Northwest Missouri where ""Ride With the Devil"" was filmed. Clay County, Missouri was a hotbed for southern sympathizers and where Jesse and Frank James became notorious. This story closely parallels the outlaws lives and border wars that preceded the civil war. Everything from the costumes to the accents and colloqial expressions are dead on correct. This is NOT a western, it is a very subtle, beautifully filmed civil war drama set on the southern frontier. The people of Northwest Missouri were pioneering southerners, tough and resilient and brought their southern ways up the Missouri river from Kentucky and Virginia. This area is called ""Little Dixie"". The film is deftly acted by Tobey Maguire, playing ""Jake Roedel"" who goes through the transformation of being pulled into the conflict by circumstances. He goes from a clean cut, son of a German immigrant to an all out long-haired hell raisin' southern bushwacker rebel. He is amazing to watch. I would call Jeffrey Wrights performance Oscar-worthy. He plays the former slave ""Holt"". This is really more of a film than a movie, it does have action, but it is more of a period drama with the story unfolding. Jewel does a great job as the local farm widow who is helping to protect the guerillas. The cinematography is sweeping and goes through all four seasons, (watch for this)!"

dvd,2 of 16,1.0,A silly juvenile film.  A pseudointellectual piece of nonsense.,Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people.  But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.  The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism).  The film appeals to naive youth
dvd,,4.0,Fair compilation; good value for your money,"This music video compilation is a must have for any 80's music fan. The main problem with most such video compilations out there these days is that they are too scanty. The average music video DVD contains like 5-7 songs at the most. Wouldn't you rather spend a few dollars more and get a disc which contains more good hits in one place? And this collection does exactly that. It puts (videos of) 14 of the 80's best hits in one place. Agreed, there is still a lot more space on a DVD to get three times as many videos, but this collection stands out compared to the other collections out there today. The other good thing is that there were a lot of one-hit-wonder bands back then that you cannot really find videos of now e.g. Dan Hartman or Berlin. You can easily get a DVD of Tears For Fears videos but not these other bands. Even if you could many people wouldn't buy them because they only had a few good songs to their credit. So it is great to get your hands on a DVD where you can find all these good numbers in one place. In a nutshell: there's room for improvement, but that shouldn't blind you to what it's worth and pass it over"
dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Inept!,"The horror anthology format was one which had been most successfully utilised by British cinema. From Ealing Studios atmospheric and brilliant DEAD OF NIGHT to the films of Amicus in the 1960's and 70's. The form was rejuvenated  in the USA, when George A Romero finally gave in to Hollywood and collaborated with Stephen King on CREEPSHOW. CREEPSHOW worked because it was  an unabashed and unashamed tribute to the EC horror comics of the 1950's. The Visual qualities of the film, coupled with its trite speech bubble dialogue and thin characterisation  gave it a comic book feel that perhaps only SIN CITY has since replicated to any degree of success. "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Bella Martha is about dealing with loss, profound grief, recovery, love and  human relationships  (VHS Edition)","Martha Klein is the head chef  at Hamburg restaurant 'The Lido'. The restaurant's kitchen is her safe haven and she prepares the food for the guests with compulsive and obsessive perfection, not thinking of anything else in life. Several incidents at  the restaurant compel  Martha's boss to insist that Martha takes some time off and visits a therapist. To keep the restaurant's kitchen up to full strength a second chef Italian Mario is hired.  However most importantly when Martha's sister is killed in an accident this casts her suddenly in the role of guardian/surrogate parent of her niece Lina, who is eight years old.  All of this constitutes the premise of this very interesting and wonderful German film which was directed by Sandra Nettelbeck and which is spoken in German and in some scenes Italian is also used."

Of course i was only 24 at the time.Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls..

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Farcical who done it with chanson,"This farcical ""who done it"" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time.

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Surprising gem,"Read the plot once over.  It sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it?  At the very least, it sounds like it'll be an unholy meld of slapstick and cheeseball cutesiness.  It does incorporate both elements, but with honest restraint.  The rest of the movie is warm and enjoyable, chock full of characters you actually *gasp* care about.  And while you're busy wondering how that happened, you're also laughing your ass off.  Because it's funny as well as heartwarming.  And Steve Zahn is hilarious"

But, I see Stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer, unless you count his homage to Fidel Castro.  The only movies worth watching are his early movies, Salvador and Platoon, which for some reason didn't make the cut. Instead, you have the insufferable Born on the Fourth July and his conspiracy theories on the death of JFK, with a whole lot of filler in between"
dvd,,5.0,"A Rewarding Investment (of time), but NOT A COP SHOW","The Wire is easily one of the greatest, if not the greatest, cinematic pieces of art ever.  Potential WATCHERS know this however, this is a show that requires a significant amount of commitment; do not expect to sit back and be entertained.  The show challenges the watcher and requires reflection on an array of intellectual levels.  At a minimum, the reasonably bright should have no problem connecting the scattered dots The Wire's creators masterfully placed for viewers.  The dull on the other hand will only see a show with cops and a group of unintelligible thugs while searching for the quick entertainment fix that can only come from brainless shows like Cops, CSI, or The Shield."

Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market.

It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better"

dvd,12 of 24,5.0,You people piss me off,"why? why?? would you review a product before it even comes out??? customer reviews are meant for you to post your thoughts on something.....that you have actually purchased and had a chance to view and critique. senseless blabber of how you love family guy is extremely pointless. if anyone is reading your thoughts anyway....guess what....they're a family guy fan too! maybe we wanted to know about the quality of the bonus features, deleted scenes, commentary, and extra hidden stuff. ever thought of that? that is what most people buy the sets for anyway. because anyone can watch family guy every night of the week on Adult Swim, TBS, and FOX. this is not a forum! and that folks, is what grinds my gears"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,It's Not Quite A Ten,"""Stick It"" had tough competition right out of the gates.  Written and directed by ""Bring It On"" writer, Jessica Bendinger, everyone expected something along the same lines as that cheerleading comedy which, as time has passed, has become rather tired and corny.  In all honesty, I feel that ""Stick It"" has potential to remain a solid film long after ""Bring It On"" has begun to gather dust on the DVD shelf."
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,2 stars because it made me laugh,"The absurdity of this movie made me laugh quite a bit. The sets were cheap, the plot (if you can call it that) was clunky, and the direction stank. A lot of people who have reviewed this already are railing on the actors, and the only reason I don't is because I have seen most of the main cast (the ones on the front cover) do very well in other roles. It is evident that they really weren't given much to work with."
dvd,1 of 7,1.0,Worst anime tv show I had seen in a few years,The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked. 
dvd,,4.0,So cute....,"I caught this movie on TV a few nights ago and I really had no desire to watch it, but there was nothing else on. I can honestly say it was ADORABLE! It was very well written, well animated, and well done. It's a great movie no matter what your age! I don't know why it wasn't promoted better when it initially came out..."

dvd,3 of 6,4.0,"Wonderful - but I have a ""widescreen"" issue","Okay - here's the problem with how they are editing film for new widescreen TV today. In the old days, they took widescreen movies and cut off the left and right sides to fit on your full-screen TV. NOW they are taking full-screen video from years ago and editing off the tops and bottoms to fit into a widescreen format! How lame! Classic video footage chopped up. Why not leave it as full screen with black bars on the left and right sides, rather than chopping it up. Whoever the ingrates are that are doing this should be relieved of their duties. Very upsetting for a purist"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Beautiful-Classic,I loved this film.  It is for both young and old.  The characters are so creative and the music is catchy and intelligent.  The voices are perfect for their characters.  One of my favorite Disney Films by far!  I highly recommend it
dvd,,5.0,The gang's all here!,"Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool. The first installment of The Super Mario Bros Super show is here on DVD! I remember as a kid coming home from school and doing my home work. Then after that, it was the Mario Bros with Toad saving Princess Toadstool. I am so excited that Dic gave Shout permission to release this classic cartoon on to DVD. Lou Albano, (former Wrestling star) and Danny Wells, (cameo actor) do great voices of Mario, and Luigi. Jeeny Alice, and John Stalker do great voices for Princess Toadstool, and Toad. Harvey Atkins does a great job for the voices of the Mayor in some episodes. He also does great with the Koopa voice, and the Triclide voice. All of the animators did a very good job drawing the charactors from the game. Nintendo is an excellent company for giving Dic permission to make a cartoon out of the game. They did a cartoon based on the Super Mario Bros game, and Super Mario Bros two game. Wart was never seen in the cartoon. There are a few audio spots in the set that are noticable. One spot is in the episode, ""Two plumbers and a baby."" Near the end of the episode where Koopa says, ""I'll be back to get you. When I grow up!"" The sound is messed up a bit when Koopa is crying. The other spot is in the second full lenth episode when the rap is being played. You can hear a slight audio pop. It's loud enough to scare you if your not paying that close attention. Other then those two complaints? Best DVD set ever! Go DIC entertainment"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A gem ,"This, along with Autumn Sonata, ranks among Ingrid Bergman's best performances. Bing Crosby does a great job too. See this wonderful movie with the whole family."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Sit Back & Enjoy,"Air Force is the best film This action film, for me, should be rated as being a ""Action Film"". Harrison Ford once again plays the reluctant hero, and plays it very well.This is a great film if you want to sit back and be entertained without having to think too much.It will not set your world on fire but you will enjoy it,The picture quality is very good with a nice anamorphic transfer and very few marks on the print, This film may suffer from a slightly unbelievable story line but when you have Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Glenn Close delivering performances as strong as these, In this action packed blockbuster, Hollywood legend Harrison Ford stars as President Marshall on board the presidential plane Air Force 1. 1000's of feet in the air President Marshall is horrified when he discovers that the plane has been hijacked by communist radicals. Unless he meets the demands of Korshunov (radicals leader), everyone on board Airforce One will be executed. As well as having to save his own skin the President also faces the daunting prospect of having to rescue his wife and daughter from the jaws of death."
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Argento's Directorial Debut is a Smash!!," Dario Argento's directorial debut brings us an intriguing murder mystery. Anyone fimiliar with Argento's works should be thoroughly pleased with this film. While it's not nearly as violent as his other slasher flicks such as ""Tenebre"", and not on the same level as that of ""Deep Red"" or ""Suspiria"", it doesn't lack in suspense or style. "
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,"Great Show, Outstanding Picture Quality","I watched this boxed set in its entirety. The show is fantastic. I have been waiting for this DVD set for 10 years! I really love this show. These episodes are fantastic, but other reviews have talked about the quality of the show, so I'll focus on the set itself."
dvd,,5.0,Long waited DVD,"Well, this is one of the long-waited DVDs from Pink Floyd."
dvd,5 of 11,1.0,What?!,I thought Criterion Collection picked classics.  Not hollywood popular entertainment.  This film was good for what it was.  For the mass audiences to hold their attention.  This was not art.  Nor was this masterful filmmaking.  This does not belong in the collection.  But then again neither does Armageddon or Fat Girl
dvd,,5.0,DAS BOOT ORIGINAL GERMAN W/SUBT ENGL,"EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SHOPPING FOR, AND THIS DVD HAS EXTRA MATERIAL !!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Pretty cool video,"Great video.  They go to pretty good lengths to show each piece of equipment and then they slide the word in underneath in text to show how to spell the equipment - I like this education side of the video.  My 2 year old was glued to the set for the first 25 minutes.  And they have a female firefighter and other young girls in the video so it is for both sexes.  After 25 minutes the video runs some credits, but then kicks back up again for another 15 minutes of more equipment for the older kids.  The neatest thing about this video is that the video sleeve opens up into a board book with pictures of all the equipment and their names.  My daughter loves for me to ""read"" her this ""book"" as she points out the equipment.  I have never seen a video do that before.  Pretty high quality, and a ton of fire engine scenes with the lights and sirens"

My God what an excellent way to show the true pain of confussion, love, lust and terror all rolled into one young gay man.  Wow, I could not believe how this movie made me feel from start to finish.  I hope that young gay boys and even girls find strength in this film.  A++"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Nobody laughs at yah with a grand in your pocket. ,"This is a great movie.  After the local steel mill goes bankrupt, most of it's former employees find themselves with out a job, and without hope.  Five unemployed men find themselves thrust together by circumstances to learn to become strippers.  During their ardous training, they develop a close bond, supporting each other through individual tragedies.  A fun movie, though with strong language not suitable for children.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend this movie for mature vewiers."

He worships no one so much as his own father, although the images Frank JR glimpses through his rose-colored glasses aren't so much reality as they are the landscape his father has created for him to see."

Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy..."

dvd,1 of 1,2.0,What a Waste,"This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto ""Semper Eadem"", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Slow and effective,"After nearly 49 years of a sedentary life, I decided I was going to get in shape.  This was a great video to start with since I had not been physically active.  I could not do a lot of the Yoga moves or keep the pace of the dance moves at first, but I can do most everything now after several months.  I have &quot;advanced&quot; to some of Denise's fat-blasting tapes, but I still do this one several times a week.  Excellent for lower back strength and flexibility"
dvd,8 of 28,2.0,Nothing i allready didn't know,This is a very uninforming movie.  I'm usually a fan of a good propaganda movie but this is just bad.  There is no relevent information here they simply tell you ideas that you most likely allready had in your head without confirming them with hard evidence.  If you want to watch an actually worth while journalistic film about the bush ties then get Martial Law 911 : rise of the police state.  NOw that is one brilliant peice of wor
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,A Great Movie For The Little Ones...,"Well, my kids really enjoy this movie.  They can actually sit through the whole movie & they are only 2 & 3 1/2.  I don't want to make too many comments for the adults because I'm sure most adults aren't going to buy this just for themselves.  I wouldn't recommend that but if you were looking for a movie to please your kids then I'd highly recommend this movie.    I think all kids up to the age of 8 or so would enjoy this movie.  Basically the story is that this little boy all of a sudden finds that he can hear everything that dogs say.  Supposedly there is a planet out there made of up all dogs & Hubble the boy's dog has just been sent from there to grade the dogs on earth.  So, like I said this is a movie I'd recommend for kids but adults might think it's a little far-fetched. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,A classic that never gets old,"In my opinion, it's a toss-up between this and Blackadder as the greatest British comedy of all time. Warning: this complete set includes rather lengthy (and not always interesting) interviews with John Cleese before every episode. If you have no interest in the script-writing process or Cleese's relationship with the actor who played Manuel, then that might be a minor bother you'll have to fast forward through. But even so- this is a great series"
dvd,2 of 8,5.0,I love it,"I absolutly loved russells role he is so crazy and intelligent, well i just loved it thats all i can sa"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,One of Cagney's very best; old-movie fans will love this,"James Cagney stars in this brisk crime melodrama from 1935, directed with verve by William Keighley. When hoodlums dispose of Cagney's pal, Cagney becomes a government agent and goes after the mob. Fans of old movies may lose count of all the familiar faces: Lloyd Nolan, Ann Dvorak, Robert Armstrong, Barton MacLane, Noel Madison, Harold Huber, Addison Richards, and so many more fine character players. The film has unfortunately dated more than some Cagney pictures (the nightclub floor show and the crimefighting technology of 1935 have since become quaint), but for simple cops-and-robbers action with mugs, molls, gunplay, guttersnipe slang, and getaway cars, not to mention a sterling performance by Cagney, &quot;G-Men&quot; is hard to beat. The print is excellent, and so is the video transfer."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Still Quirky and Funny Black Comedy Tells the Ultimate Opposites-Attracts Love Story,"This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,i want the original music score back!,"This 2-disc set is fantastic....except one MAJOR problem. The decision to replace the original melodramatic score with more ""up-beat"" 50's rock 'n roll songs. Total mistake. It turns the entire mood of the film into more of a comedy than a drama. If you can get past the horrible new soundtrack, this is a great purchase. The extra 22 minutes of footage almost makes up for it"
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,"Chaplin, acquiring and refining his screen genius","This odd collection of three films features Chaplin first as a supporting player for Keystone early in 1914, and as the lead for First National in 1919, after a highly creative period at  Essanay and Mutual. The contrast between the films is striking, and it is interesting, but unusual,  to have them together in the same volume. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,highly recommended,"if you are expecting to be scared out of your pants - don't - this movie is not scary but more suspenseful. it is a great movie, with awesome twists and anyone who said that they figured out this movie is a liar. this movie is perfectly written, acted and directed. see this movie"
dvd,,5.0,Beavis and Butthead Do America.,"I laughed my a** off this movie!Rated PG-13 for continous crude sex related humor and language,and a drug-related scene.Parents may want to watch it before letting their kids view it if kids are under the age of 10"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"You'll get this for its ""scandalous"" reputation, but enjoy it for its great story","Long before David Lynch was fascinated with the notion of wholesome-looking small towns hiding dark underbellies, ""Peyton Place"" examined the same theme.  In fact, ""Peyton Place"" took the idea one step further: the dark doings under the surface of a ""nice"" town were one thing, but equally damaging was the fear that one's mistakes, misfortunes, and private business would ""get out"" and everyone would know about them.  That fear, in turn, made it very difficult- at least in this story- to face up to and correct the initial misstep or problem, and thus a vicious circle was created."

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Fantastic Overall Workout!,"I bought this tape years ago and loved it.  I recently moved and the tape was misplaced in the move!  Of course I had to replace it.  It is broken up into 3 workouts.  Upper body (20 mins), Lower body (20 mins) and a bonus 7 minute abs.  You can break it up over a couple days or do all at once.  I do the entire workout and it is a full, overall workout.  The workouts have 2 versions, light weight or heavy weights with different intervals for both.  I am working my way up to the heavy weights!  I am a Kathy Smith lover and highly recommend any of her videos"
dvd,0 of 4,4.0,"Funny, yet kind of gross.","I bought this for my son who is in the stages of potty training.  He will not watch it, but I did and I thought it was hilarious.  It kind of grossed me out watching the mouse sit on the toilet and all, but for the most part it was funny.  I am sad that my son won't watch it, but in time I think he will love it"
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,The defining performance of Mr. Washington's career; brilliant,"In the movie DISCLOSURE, with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore (based on the Michael Crichton screenplay), a high-powered, very ambitious and sexually potent woman sexually harasses Michael Douglas in a software company. The resulting chaos this causes in his personal and professional life forces him to accept the irony of his circumstance--him, a man, being harassed by a superior woman--and take her to court, or in this case, arbitration, to save his job. So much controversy was engendered by the plot of this movie and its relationship to the serious issue of sexual harassment (then a fairly new one) that most people ranting on either side about DISCLOSURE's true social significance forgot the actual plot of the movie, and as such, missed its real message: Demi Moore's character was brought to the software company Douglas' character worked for for the sole purpose of getting rid of him in the first place, such that a pretty immoral and essentially illegal business transaction could go through, making the principal stockholders rich. The movie actually begins where the famous sexual harassment subplot ends. Like ERIN BROKOVICH or WALL STREET, DISCLOSURE was not about sex and power, but really a window to the architecture and life-destroying immorality of corporate greed in its entirety."
dvd,,5.0,CALLING ALL STAR TREK LOVERS,"For those who are having withdrawal symptoms since the last Star Trek series with Scott Bakula was cancelled, here's your answer.  The cast is superb and the story lines weave much deeper than the Star Trek Series. You'll find the episodes riveting and be singing praises there's a replacement series that feeds our sci-fi drive.  Don't let the two sets of second season series numbered Season 2 & 2.5 confuse.  They're all worth it"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Worthy of the Name... Jurassic,"A surprisingly good film considering it is the third in the series, Jurassic Park III, provides another take on the well known by now paleontologist and of course... the dinosaurs!  When Alan Grant is contacted by a wealthy couple to act as a guide on an aerial tour over the restricted island of Sorna things are not all that they seem..."

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,You MUST purchase this DVD!!,"I was skeptical when I ordered this DVD because I have had bad luck with ""beginners"" workout videos.  I am so happy that I was wrong in this case.  Ms. Ivanhoe is a wonderful coach and really guides beginners through each pose.  I never felt pushed to the limits but I did feel energized and like I had a good workout when I was done.  "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,A classic when I was little and a classic for all time,"I first saw this film in my early teens.  My mother said that she thought that I would like it because it gives you a reason to think and entertains at the same time.  Now that I am an adult, I bought it for myself because I could never bore of seeing this movie.  The movie has a cast of characters that are so different in so many ways, but they do show that we are are ultimately humans.  (At least, we hope we are.)"
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,This is what the Disney Treasures Collection was made for!,"In the early 1940s, when the United States joined a second World War against the forces of evil, it was important that all Americans did their part. Walt Disney was no exception, and he and his artists took on the task fearlessly! This significant entry into the Walt Disney Treasures Collection limited-edition DVD line compiles the Disney Studios' war-themed animated shorts from that era along with the feature film ""Victory Through Air Power,"" which is accompanied by some great interviews, galleries, and training film samples and clips. Much of this brilliant material has gone unseen since the 1940s, making this set a ""Must Have"" for Disney and WWII buffs all over! Here's a run through of what you'll find in this Disney dream-come-true!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A true Legend,"Let's face it - Barry Manilow is a legend.  After all, you don't last 30 years in a business as tough as the music industry AND continue to perform to sell-out crowds over and over again.  For those people who don't have the chance to see Barry in person (unfortunate as that may be), this DVD is the NEXT best thing.  Barry's Vegas show is phenomenal - a true showcase of his warmth as a human being and his tremendous musical talents. For the price of this DVD, you simply cannot go wrong"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent  Brian Teaser,"Hercule Poirot is again at his finest in this collectors set.All three films are set in the art deco elegance of the 1930's Europe, which is perfect to make the stories come to life and keep you on the edge of your seat with drama. In The Kidnapped Prime Minister, Hercule Poirot, with his razor sharp wit, solves a mystery even the ""Yard"" can't solve, with a surprise twist of an ending. In The Adventure of the Western Star, Hercule Poirot uses his sharp deductioning power and skills of hand, so expertly that he even fools Hastings. In the end,it is truly a surprise. In How Does Your Garden Grow, Hercule Poirot deftly solves the murder mystery with the assistance of Hastings as his side-kick. All three of these films are a real treasure you'll want to see again and again. This is a wonderful collection to add to your collection. Enjoy!   "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Pacino & Crowe at their best,"If you're looking for a riveting movie that will keep you glued to your set through the entire performance, this is it."
dvd,,4.0,!!?? :O,It is typical David Lynch film. Beautiful cinema photography
dvd,,4.0,Surprisingly good,"Well acted and scripted, this movie surprised me. I was expecting the usual action flick fare of clich�d characters, very little emotional development, and a predictable storyline, but, was shocked to find that there were actually a few surprises. Yes, as with most action films, bits of logic get lost and leave you thinking, ""Now why on earth would you do THAT?"", but, if you suspend belief for a few minutes, it works. I also enjoyed the fact that no one is safe, regardless of how big an actor or important a role.... the ending left me a bit cold, as I seem to remember the ending in the original being far more climactic, but, I was thankful that they left out the requisite ""5 Years Later..."" ending that you expect"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A genuine classic!,"This amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability.  The combination of puppets and live action works really well, David Bowie is wonderful, and, all in all, it's a great family film.  When I gave it to my two granddaughters, ages 8 & 4, they watched it wide-eyed and a little bit scared. But then they watched it at least once a day for the next week"
dvd,26 of 27,4.0,excellent in every way but one,"The morning routine is beautiful and easy to follow.  The tone of the dvd is peaceful and graceful.  The Solo Forms section is great for a beginner, but I agree with others who say it is difficult to reverse the movements, right to left.  I want to be able to copy what I see, and reversing right to left is too confusing, so I literally turn the laptop around, and look at the reflection of it in a mirror, so that I can copy his actions exactly, and that works fine. "
dvd,1 of 3,2.0,Jason X,"Jason X~ Lexa Doig is a quite good movie in the friday the 13th series. Compared with the downright awfull part 9, i.e., Jason Goes to hell this sequell has a better script, dialogue, acting and plot. Part 9 was the first time New Line owned the rights to the movie (it was prior to this owned by paramount) and there first crack at making the sequells, was if one is kind less then stellar and if one is honest, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This time they put a little bit more time and effort into the sequell and yeah it is not a quality movie but compared to the rest of the friday the 13th franchise this is one of the better entries. Even so it is not as good as part 4 or part one and it might sound like a paradox (since I have written that it was so much better then part 9 which I gave one star) that I only give the movie 2 stars. But being the 10 part in the series, the budget, and special effects are on the level of mediocre sequells. The dialogue is yes better then part nine but it is still pretty awfull and it sounds like the script and dialogue writers just barely finished community college. The music is awfull and sounds like it was done on a cheap computer or a toy keyboard. This movie should be seen by die hard fans of the franchise otherwise this is a movie could be easily avoided"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,clears up the cliffhanger from vol. 5 + some comic relief before the serious ending in Vol.7,"Basically, if you've been collecting the series up until now, then you know that you need this volume to see the end of the journey with the blind woman. If you haven't been collecting the series, then you don't have a reason to buy this, as it just won't make any sense. "
dvd,7 of 8,4.0,"Great Acting, Dark Movie","Johnny Depp gives another sterling performance, this time as John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, and there are strong performances by John Malkovich and Samantha Morton, but overall, the movie is dark and disturbing. But I suspect that's what it was supposed to be. Critics may love this movie because of the performances, but I doubt many viewers who just want to be entertained will like it. While the performances are first rate,the movie is curtained in despair, much like the lead character."
dvd,7 of 11,5.0,"""We weren't made for the sea...""","An outstanding film, Waterworld, brings to the screen the likely scenario that the ice caps melt (they've already started) endangering mankind and threatening life on Earth.  The likelihood of such a phenomenon is presently great indeed, and hopefully the film will get many people thinking.  "
dvd,,5.0,"Complex, funny, amazing skill","The magic of Charlie Chaplain is amazing.  The comedy moves the audience from scene to scene following logical conclusion: Cabin fever, bear dinner, house balancing on the ledge, the discover of gold, and reverse of luck for the little fellow.   The silent acting skill moves the audience mind tensely between scene connections and allows for surprises and laughter at the justapose solutions. For example, when the prospector loses his memory of the location of his Gold stake, but remembers the little fellow and releases the little fellow knows the location of the cabin and from there the location of the gold stake."
dvd,,5.0,"SO GOOD, IT'LL MAKE YA' WANTA SLAP YO' MOMMA!","""Tastes so good, it'll make you want to slap your momma""!! This is just one the hilarious quotes from ""Friday After Next"". This is one seriously funny movie. If you don't just bust-up with laughter, then you are probably already dead. Ice Cube and his buddy Mike Epps deliver one Hell of a good Christmas themed comedy. This time around, Ice Cube plays his role to the max, and manages to showcase the ""Craig"" character in ways not shown in the two previous ""Friday"" films. Craigs entire family are here, engaged in antics wild and crazy enough to make anyone roll with laughter. The whole ""Bro's Bar-B-Q"" scene alone, makes this a film not to miss. I watched this film again, while visiting friends in the Philippines. And the Filipinos laughed eved harder than my American friends did! It seems that Ice cube's movies are a big hit all over the world. So I say get yourself a copy of ""Friday After Next"", and invite some friends over to watch it. This is one movie worth adding to your comedy film collection. Ice Cube always delivers, and this time, he really takes care of business. "
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,French Cancan: Marvelous,"French Cancan, one of three Renoir films packaged by Criterion as Stage and Spectacle, is a marvelous movie. The story is simple but the execution is amazing. A Belle Epoque impresario, down on his financial luck, is going to open a new club, the Moulin Rouge, with a new dance, the French cancan. He encounters a working girl and makes her a dancer. She'll become a star. There are several crises to overcome before that happens."
dvd,11 of 22,4.0,Great film - pity about the shipping,"Loved this film, it's an open and interesting look at the way people handle desire.  I particularly appreciated the underlying message that love should be regarded as just love, not labeled and neatly put in a box to marginalise people."
dvd,13 of 14,5.0,"""Didn't I promise to safeguard your morals or something?""","Based on the Alan Hollinghurst novel, the BBC television series ""The Line Of Beauty"" unfolds through the eyes of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens). Nick, a middle class student studying Henry James at Oxford, is invited by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to stay at his family's posh home in London's Notting Hill. Nick is swept away by the Feddens' prestige and affluence, and as he becomes enamored with the family, he's seduced by money, power, and sex into the moral void that surrounds the Feddens. Ultimately this is a tale of the 80--Thatcher's Britain, the corruption of the wealthy set, racism, homophobia, classism, and the sceptre of AIDS."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Not a Real Nude Scene,"A quick reminder to the audience about this movie...It is a TV movie. 2nd thing, I realize a lot of people want to see this movie for one reason. They get to see Jamie-Lynn DiScala (although she's now divorced and using the last name Sigler) disrobe. Well, as for the first comment...It's a TV movie and if you're watching it, it's pretty obvious what it is. But, it's not horrible for a TV movie. In the land of bio-pics, it's no masterpiece but it has its moments of entertainment and it's pretty interesting. The 2nd thing, despite various reports you do not actually see DiScala take her clothes off. She's using a body double and the network did not even attempt to hide this little fact. In the scene where DiScala is meeting Brenda Fricker, she opens her shirt. The camera pulls back, as Fricker asks for DiScala to come closer. Look at DiScala's face...It's not hers, then there's a quick cut and marvelously, DiScala's face has reappeared. So, for the naked DiScala seekers. this is the wrong spot. But, anyway, this movie basically tells you what you probably already knew (Heidi Fleiss is on every 'E Network' special there is). Heidi Fleiss became a prostitute to big names in the entertainment business and eventually took over as Madame and began banking more money than she could handle. Eventually she was caught, jailed, and released. DiScala's performance is far from Meadow, whom she plays on ""The Sopranos"", and there's times where she even looks like Heidi Fleiss (except, for the record, DiScala is way hotter) but sometimes the dialogue is really bad so it looks like a bad soap opera. It's hard for me to grade this film because it's really bad, but it's kind of good. So, this movie may not warrant the ""B"" grade in the same way a movie like ""Crash"" would warrant an ""A"" grade...But, oh well."
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Inna nutshell:,A swashbuckling movie with a believable plot; a realistic glimpse into the medieval mindset; the horrors of warfare exposed; the truth about `christendom' and a flick full of good-looking euro-trash!
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Very good,"This film reminded me a lot of ""Casino"" - interesting story, appealing actors, good sets, dialog and costumes - but they also share one more characteristic - they both feature several souless, sadistic characters who perform horrific acts of brutality. "

If you want an excellent old vintage movie, in my opinion this is definatly one to purchase and have for your collection!!.. Jane Wyman won and oscar for her performance and she deserved it!...."

I started off with number 2 (whcih people here seem to hate for some reason), then was blown away when I saw number 1. I rented number 3 with pretty high expectations. I was expecting a zombie holocaust type situation (even if it was only in one town) along with a descent amount of comedy. "
dvd,,5.0,The Greatest Motion Picture Ever Made,"As I watched the final frames play out on THE THIRD MAN, I knew that I'd just witnessed the cinematic equivalent of great poetry.  Something in the bleak, hopelessness of the scene (and the human experience) were summed up in the dead leaves drifting lifelessly across the screen and in the way that Holly Martins lights another cigarette and bitterly tosses the match to the ground.

So I'm not immune to this kind of products."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Danger is my companion.,"What's there not to laugh at in this movie. The very concept of Farley playing a white Ninja just makes me laugh. This is a movie you watch more then once and laugh harder the second, third, fourth time around. There is some classic comedy in this movie. Some of my personal favoriate scenes are:"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The best rock documentary I have ever seen.," This is the best documentary I have seen about any rock album. There is great editing, weaving the music in and out of the documentary. There is great interviews with all the band members, (although Nick Mason does not get much air time, Why?). There are also clips of the band members doing acoustic versiions of several of the songs, Absolutely incredible!!!!!!!!!  A Must have for any Pink Floyd Fan"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Review for Two Weeks Notice,"Lucy Kelson is a smart and funny attorney whose sole purpose in life from childhood was to fight for the last shreds of justice in the concrete jungle that is New York City. When she hears that Wade Corporation is planning to knock down her beloved Coney Island community center, she spares no time in stopping its CEO George Wade (played by Hugh Grant) in the street en rooute to his limo to convince him otherwise. Coincidentally, George has recently been berated by his older brother Howard (the real boss of the company) about his choice of chief counsel and their actual abilities. After quizzing her on her education and resume, George was impressed by her quick wit and perserverance, George hires Lucy on the spot and there begins a torturous yet blossoming relationship. Named after the customary two weeks notice that employees give employers before resigning from their jobs, this movie is superbly funny not only because of the jokes but because of the ingenious acting of Bullock and Grant. They convey wonderfully the light-hearted atmosphere of their relationship, and are versatile enough to switch from being quirkily humorous to sweetly romantic. The antics are never-ending, and added with Grant's bumbling British accent, makes this movie a gem of a romantic comedy"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Another gritty cop thriller from Clint!,"This suspenseful police drama suceeds on many different levels--as a gritty serial killer chase, a portrayal of transition to retirement for a high achieving senior, a re-discovery of love and life and a portrayal of obsession.  Eastwood excels at choosing great stories. His direction and acting are also superb."
dvd,,5.0,Bend it Like Beckham Scores lots of Goals with me BRILLIANT!,"Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you.

I think they'll thank you for it."

dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Splendid DVD Shows Why Li Is Among Our Best Young Pianists,"Deutsche Grammophon has to be commended for producing a superb documentary video which is an ample, excellent demonstration of young Chinese pianist Yundi Li's brilliant, technically refined and yet, quite expressive, playing. His performance of the Liszt Sonata in B Minor on this DVD may be better than the performance recorded on his critically acclaimed Liszt CD issued a few years ago. Without question, his thoughtful, expressive interpretation of this work demonstrates that although he is still quite young, he is nonetheless a very mature artist, whose skills will undoubtedly improve as he grows older; it is an interpretation that compares favorably to any I have heard or seen live from the likes of Brendel or Pletnev, for example. The other pieces on this DVD are also played with ample technical skill, with the right balance of expressive playing thrown in, most notably the Chopin Scherzi. When I heard Yundi Li for the first time perform live at Carnegie Hall last month, I was most impressed by the beautifully warm tones and reluctance to use the pedals; these I believe are exemplary aspects of his playing, which not only demonstrate his maturity, but why I believe he is among the best young pianists of his generation"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,"Thank God It's ""Friday""!"," I don't know if Howard Hawk's ""His Girl Friday"" is the greatest dialogue comedy of all-time, but it's certainly in the top five. I can only think of one other comedy where the dialogue is as fast paced as this movie, and that's ""Duck Soup"". But it took four Marx brothers to match what Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell do in this picture."
dvd,8 of 12,4.0,Not Kurosawa's best,"Kagemusha is not a 5 star movie.  It is a big step down from Ran (which is very similar in many aspects, but has a great story) and Seven Samurai (a very different and more comedic, earlier movie by Kurosawa).  Kagemusha has two major problems.   The story is quite simplistic, a big problem with a three hour movie.  Incredible visuals and excellent production quality carry much of the movie; there are a few really great scenes, as can be expected of any Kurosawa movie.  But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4-star territory, and that is the ludicrous final battle.  There's a lot worth remembering in Kagemusha, but the crazy ending, unfortunately, sticks in the mind.  "
dvd,4 of 6,4.0,A Highly Improved Version,"Hemingway's acknowledged masterpiece about Spanish Civil War guerillas was censored both in print and in film.  In print, the four letter words were cut and stilted pseudo-Spanish substituted.  That defect of course remains in this pretty much faithful transmission of the text; it is what gives it a funny archaic sound most do not understand.  Also, 2 key scenes were cut from the cinema release, to make the story less ""brutal"" and to emphasize the romance.  These episodes were  Pilar's telling of the execution of the fascists in her village, and El Sordo's final stand.  Thankfully, this version restores both magnificent scenes, making a much tougher, grittier film that is worthy of Hemingway's realism.  One could only rate the prior version 3 stars, at best.  This however is a first rate American film now being seen for the first time, 60 years later."
dvd,,5.0,This movie is completely ridiculous.,... and that's why it's so good.
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Fabulous photography,"Brandenburg, a world famous photographer, sets out on a personal mission with his thinking and experience beautifully described in this stunning DVD. His pictures describe the Boundary Waters Wilderness with clarity and simplicity. One aches to be there with him and enjoy the natural setting and its beauty"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"This movie is an original, unlike others who copy each other, its EXCELLENT!","I first saw this movie with my son about 15 years ago, and was amazed at the originality of the storyline, cinematography, and fantastic characters.  My son just loved the movie and watched it over and over again.  I couldn't help but love the movie, and watch it with him, it just always caught my attention.  To this day, I still love this movie.  Though they have come out with parts two and three, this one is my favorite of them all.  And thankfully no other film-makers have tried to copy the idea, because it would flop if they did, you just can't top this story.  When my children grow up and have their own, I'll be watching it with my grandchildren too!  Jim Henson had a hand in this movie, so understandably, some of the characters are very well done by him.  This movie is just a pure classic, and always will be, it cannot be outdone!  It's a wonderful fantasy, for children and parents alike"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,I LOVE this movie!!,"This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.  It's funny and beautiful, with a perfect cast.  The music and the scenery is breathtaking.  I agree with a previous reviewer, I can't think of anything that isn't perfect with this film"
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,dont bother,"It is ok if You want to see it, but I wouldnt recomended to buy it, cause I wont see it more then the timne I saw it, I really do not know why people have given so much stars to a very regular movi"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Truly a Masterpiece of Cinema,"Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2"" is considered by many to be one of the best films ever made, but has a large amount of haters too. It's not hard to see why, even if you love the film. It mixes fantasy and reality, sometimes jumping from one to the other with little-to-no warning. Some critics have even complained they couldn't tell what parts of the movie were fantasy and reality, which I think is actually kind of stupid...I knew exactly what was and what wasn't. I think it'll be hard for people to not acknowledge that this is a great film. It's not one of the most entertaining movies I've seen, but it's wonderfully photographed and has some classic moments. Visuals definitely overrule plot in the film. The movie opens in a very trippy dream sequence. Our main character, Guido (Marcello Mastroianni), dreams that he suffers asphxia in his car and then is suddenly floats into the sky; Before being pulled down via a rope by one of his associates. Namely his screenwriter. The movie is basically like this; Guido is a director who wants to make a movie, a good movie to be precise. Problem is, he's ran out of ideas and is stuck directing a science-fiction movie he has no interest in. Meanwhile, he juggles an affair with his mistress and his wife; He's not good at it. In one scene, his wife and mistress end up at the same place together. But, looking away from plot for a second, there's one scene that stands out among all others in my head. There's a flashback scence, where Guido, as a young boy, and his schoolmates go to the beach to watch the prostitute Saraghina. This scene plays almost like a silent film. She, basically, dances for the sex-crazed young boys; But it's not the dance itself, but the music on the soundtrack that she's dancing too. Neither one of these would factors would be of much importance, but it's the combination of them that makes the scene so great. It's very surreal and just really well done. I've only seen this film once, but I'm already curiously eager to see it again. It's not like any movie I've ever seen before; The ending, especially, fits the film so well. A lot of people won't like it; It's in Italian, lots of fantasy sequences, etc. But this is a great film. Most critics, most filmmakers, Roger Ebert, and myself agree. See this film."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,An excellent rendition,"This is a really great concert version of Sweeny Todd. I saw the DVD with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury and I think nobody could top those two together, but Patti Lu Pone does Mrs. Lovett in her own way and it DEFINITELY works. I also think George Hearn needs to be congratulated on not loosing his touch in over 20 years."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,God bless Takashi Miike,"I read bad reviews of this movie and I have to wonder if the KIDS who wrote them knew anything about heartache. What I was expecting when I bought this movie was a sappy love story that ended with a stomache churning cringefest torture sequence. What I got was one of the best films on lonliness, heartache, pain and abuse that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The end is not bad, it complements the pace of the movie well and by the end of it, you sympathise with both leads so much, It's almost hard pick a side. I mean comeon... She just wants to be loved; whats wrong with that. Miike did a brilliant job of telling this tale, he rarely uses music and the cinimatic delivery is cut and dry. Very simplistic, very deliberate... It is flawless in it's execution. The best however is the... Wait, noone has mentioned that; guess we'll let you see that scene since the rest are already ruined"

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"""Please, sir, I want some more.""","This era of the DVD and competing new formats frequently brings us astonishments of riches (such as the ""Looney Tunes"" collections), but when it comes to Laurel & Hardy, we American fans must wax nostalgic for the good old Blackhawk Films days or dig around for the Hal Roach Studio's ""Lost Films of L&H"" DVD series. Just about everything else we're getting is crumbs."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Setting the standard for science-based documentaries,"Brilliantly structured, edited and shot, this multi-part series plausibly attempts to explain complex theories of particle physics and how these relate on the massive scale to laws governing our Universe.  While many scholars might hesitate to expound some of the concepts as confidently as presented here as fact, credit must still be given for presenting these theories in ways that most audiences will be able to grasp.  Visually, I don't think it could have been better, and it's the liberal use of computer graphics that simplifies comprehension for the viewer.  Overall, this is an excellent series for home or school use:  intriguing, enjoyable and entertaining."
dvd,6 of 16,1.0,If I want to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas,"Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,'Back'-splitting funny,After my dad's back surgery he watched this for the first time.

So he would have to get up and walk into the other room until he stopped laughing. Returning later to watch more.
dvd,8 of 10,5.0,Original & Creative Vinyasa Flow Yoga,"This DVD is one of my favorite Yoga DVD's. It is a challenging vinyasa yoga practice that flows really well from one pose to another but this is not the same old boring power yoga routine , it is actually unique with poses I have not seen on other yoga tapes, like doing crunches in a supine eagle pose plus a lot of great transitions from one pose to another, even the sun salutations are a little bit different. This is definitely not for beginners , it's quite fast and there are poses like crow , side plank, shoulder stand and plow and there are no modifications, but there is no super advanced stuff. There is also a bonus pranayama section and an option to do the workout with no instruction."

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Hot Chicksa,"Let's get the criticism out of the way first.  The script of a self-indulgent, Brooklyn, Bergman wanna-be massaging his Liberalism to advantage, is pseudo-intellectual air.  Woody's humor, the Jewish Complaint, is stale now.  We thought it was so funny back in the 60's and 70's.  We gave this schlemiel, a Jewish version of Waspy, Bob Hope, a free pass for thirty years.  After all the lint has been flicked from the navel, what we have is a dopey looking ethnic with delusions about the prom queen.  But then again - don't we all and there's the appeal."

Master Killer and his Lotu crew have taken on a giant Centipede costume, defeating all others at some festival.  Then Jet Li arrives dressed as a chicken.  How KFC missed such a product placement opportunity is WAY beyond me.  My brother loves this film.  I hate it.  It's corny.  The action is mediocre at best, mixing with a tired old storyline.  Save your moolah."

Kind of scary to watch, actually -- because I fear that many people feel this way, including the pugnaciously anti-intellectual currently camped out in the White House."
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,Delectable Treat,"It was a very wonderful movie with a great cast. The message was clear and brought to life by a magnificant script. It would be worth buying and adding to you DVD collection. Plus any movie,with Johnny Depp, is an A in my eyes. ***************"

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,GENETICALLY YOURS,"REPLICANT as indicated in the Amazon review is a surprisingly good movie.  Jean Claude van Damme gives one of his most convincing performances in two roles:  a slimy serial killer called the Torch who has been murdering mothers and their babies, and as his genetic double, a kind of childlike replicant.  The clone was done in order to try and retrace the movements of the real Torch, but also as a governmental experiment to initiate further plans for the future.  Van Damme is repulsive as the Torch and quite convincing as the new Torch, who is put under the care of former cop, now secret service agent Michael Rooker.  Rooker gives a compelling performance and the relationship that develops between he and the genetic double is well developed.  Ringo Lam directs with a sure eye and the action scenes are well executed.  A very surprising entry for van Damme and a good actioner overall"

The era of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall, and the ever present threat that communists would attempt to attack the U.S. with nuclear weapons. Enter James Bond, 007, license to kill. At first you think that James is out to beat a communist threat. It is only later that it is revealed that the dreaded S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organization is really who is bankrolling Dr. No. Of course, for the audience of 1962, it had to be the Soviets or the Chinese, so revealing that there was an organization even more dreaded must mean they are truly evil."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Possibly the best TV series ever made,"I thoroughly agree with the many reviewers who have praised this release and Remington Steele in general. I've been watching TV from its early days in the 1950s through the present and am convinced that Remington Steele was as good as general audience TV gets. No its not Shakespeare, but I don't think that most of us who watch TV really want weekly doses of Shakespeare. Remington Steele was a suberbly done combination of action, adventure, and romantic comedy with very good scripts and fine acting by attractive and appealing people. It was -- and still is -- consistently entertaining and no other series was better. I agree that the addition of Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs made the second and third seasons (as well as later seasons not yet available on DVD) even better than the first season, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season. If you are a fan of Remington Steele you've probably already bought the DVDs of the first two seasons and you'll love this third season too. If you've never seen Remington Steele or have forgotten how good this show was, please do yourself a favor and get this DVD set now. And, like so many other Remington Steele fans, I beg the studio to give us the remaining seasons on DVD as quickly as possible."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Great extra features,"Let's face it.  Anyone even looking at buying this movie is very likely either already a Weird Al fan, or looking for a comedy that is not quite... normal.  UHF fits both bills nicely.  Like most of Al's work, it's not a continuous rotfl fest, but it does pack some serious lol action.    But I want to address those who already own an older copy of this movie."

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Great DVD!,"I really enjoy this DVD and it made me want to buy more Janis Saffel DVDs (which I recently did!).  She is a great instructor...not annoying, very good cueing, basic but effective moves.  I never get sick of putting on this DVD because I can always rotate between the 4 workouts (I usually do 2-3 workouts at a time).  There isn't a real warm-up or cool-down, which is probably the only small negative, but I just do it on my own.  This is a great DVD if you're short on time and want to get a good cardio/toning session in during your day.  "
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,A movie for people with taste and style,"     Cool World is a great movie full of some really great creativity and innovation, and really deserves some credit especially for it's time. In terms of story, acting, and writing, it does okay, however the real shining points of this film are in the animation and more than anything the ideas and production."
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Original and Superb!,"One of the most realistic war movies ever made, Battle of Algiers is a must see for those that would like a deeper insight into revolutionary mentality and/or expert film making. From actual FLN rebels used in the film to the scenes being shot on location, Gillo Pontecorvo is able to combine a terrifying event into a cinematic masterpiece."
dvd,,5.0,Lost - The Complete Second Season,"All I can say is what a fantastic season, just as good as the first, if not better. I am a great fan of Matthew Fox from his Party of Five series and Haunted as well as his films. Lost is a very good gripping and entertaining show. This DVD set is well worth the money and has lots and lots of extras on it to watch. This is a must buy season as well as Season One. I cannot wait for Season Three of which I will watch on Sky One in the UK and then buy on DVD when it comes out. All I want now is for the TV company that made the excellent short lived series of Matthew's HAUNTED to be released on DVD to, it was brilliant.  "

dvd,7 of 8,5.0,An Excellent Series,"The Jury is the best mini-series I have seen since Band of Brothers. It is beautifully shot and the music is incredible. It is an emotional journey into the lives of seven jurors serving on a murder trial. It is also an in depth look at the trial. A 16 year old boy is accused of murdering a schoolmate that bullied him. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the outcome of the trial is pure genius and will really leave you thinking. As for the seven jurors, they all have different backgrounds and come from completely different walks of life. One woman is involved in an unhappy marriage and seeks comfort from another juror. One man is a recovering alcoholic. One man suffers from lack of money due to buying and selling stocks. One man is having trouble with his father-in-law, who wants to be involved in the trial and pesters him with questions about the trial, which he is not allowed to talk about. One man is in the process of becoming a priest, but hesitates because  he still has feelings for an old girlfriend. One woman suffers from a brain tumor and is tomented by memories of a lost son. One woman suffers from the lack of a relationship with her mother, who she is forced to call to watch her daughter while she serves as a juror. Although these seven people are different, thay all play a part in helping one another with their problems and together must determine the fate of a 16 year old boy. Like most people who buy this movie, I bought it because of Gerard Butler, but after seeing it, I could have cared less if he were in it. It is a wonderful series, very emotional and very touching. I highly recomend this to everyone because there is a little something in it for everyone. No matter what types of movies you like, there is some of everything in it. And the score is absolutly amazing, it is a very effective touch to the movie in letting you know what the characters are feeling. Excellent performances by everyone... especially Gerry"

I watched this DVD with my wife and I felt like I could handle this...and I can.  I learned about how to hold my son..I never had a baby in my family before.  There's even a family therapist that talks about how dad's are going to feel...it's usually all about the moms, but this DVD had stuff about helping the dads too.."

dvd,4 of 6,4.0,Great Product Quality , 
dvd,7 of 9,4.0,Entertaining/Mind Blowing,"This package contains 2 DVD's and about 4 hours of programming. The production quality is excellent for an educational series. The producers especially loved the visual animation of the earth colliding with a Mars sized planetesimal approximately 50 million years after the formation of the earth which resulted in the moon and a larger earth, because they used the graphic 5 or 6 times on the 1st two episodes(disc 1). The Earth was spinning 4 times faster in the early days and the moon was 6 times closer. The young sun was weaker and the atmosphere had only 1% Oxygen but within a few hundred million years there was solid crust and large volumes of liquid water. 6 hour days and up to 200 foot tidal pulls on the earth's crust by the moon's gravity with each rotation. Another concept the producer's absolutely loved was that it took almost 3 billion years for single celled photo-synthetic bacteria to bring the level of Oxygen in the atmosphere up enough to turn the planet from red to blue. When you think about it, that is a pretty awesome thing ! So for 21 hours of the 24 hour day analogy, the surface of planet earth was either lifeless(the first 600 million years (3.4 hours) or dominated by these single celled photo synthetic bacteria. Only in the last 3 hours did everything else evolve. There's more on the 1st two episodes including tests to confirm exploding meteors supplying the material for the  spark of 1st life on the planet due to peptide formation from the pressure of impact on amino acids. Episode 1 Disc 2 is goes into great detail on the possibility of extra-terrestrial life and  episode 2 deals with the making of a detailed map of the universe 380 thousand years after the Big Bang(13.7 billion years ago) when everything had finally cooled down enough to emit visible light. There are enough details in these two discs to make you think. It seems we owe our existence to serendipity as much as to inevitability. If Jupiter was not where it is for ie.,(deflecting comets and asteroids away from Earth) life would have been either extinguished or sent back to square I too many times for us to have evolved. If the earth hadn't collided with that mars sized planetesimal to form the moon we'd have a very wobbly planet with wild temperature swings. If the earth was as small as mars it's molten core would have hardened within half a billion years and it's atmosphere swept away by the solar wind. Ironically The asteroid that got through Jupiter's shield and supposedly finished off the dinosaurs was a huge stroke of luck because it allowed mammals to evolve freely eventually leading to us. Questions remain unanswered by these episodes such as,  'Why wouldn't aliens evolve faces ?' Why wouldn't other earthlike worlds have as much time for evolution as ours did ? You figure with a gas giant shield properly placed, a similar planet with a large moon in a sunlike starred solar system like ours, the time frames would be similar. The best argument put forth on this disc in my view against other technologically proficient life in the universe is the rarity of it here,(out of 100's of millions of speices in the history of multi-cellular life only we've achieved it). We could be as rare in the universe as 1 per every galactic cluster every 500 million years or less. If it were significantly more common we probably would have heard from them by now. To throw a bone to the Creationists, our existence for all practical purposes is a miracle ! As far as 'The Big Bang' or 'The Hyper-Expansion' of a super dense, super small mass to produce everything we know. It's just a theory supported by current science. We still have no clue as to where this mass came from. That would be the unanswerable question and left to whatever your concept of God is "

The star of the football team rapes a student and the student is made to be the villain. Tiffani Amber-Thiessen, all grown-up from ""Save By the Bell"" plays a student trying to elevate her popularity by hanging out with the ""cool"" crowd only to be an outcast becasue she refused to allow her attacker get away with a crime. Her girlfriends are unsupportive of her because they are too caught up in this ""hunk"" who is nothing more than a senseless jerk. "

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Vanessa Williams is fine, but, Chayanne Shines","I usually stay away from the chick-flick genre that I was forced to watch with my ex-wife, daughter and, prior to that various and sundry dates...but, from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film, I was drawn into the world of proffesional Latin dancing. I readily admit that my initial interest was to see Vanessa, since, in my opinion, she makes too few films. But, the infectious sountrack and the easy-looking, but incredibly intricate dance performances of Chayanne and crew, made me say, to quote a line from the film, ""I want to do that, too!"""
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,Superb drama and absolutely one of Miike's best,"Unlike anything else directed by Takashi Miike, The Bird People in China is a film that stays with the viewer long after ending. Though the ever-present yakuza does make an appearance here--in the form of a lone bill collector who follows the protagonist, Wada, to a remote village--that element (yakuza violence) is not at all the primary focus of the film."
dvd,21 of 23,5.0,A bit of a rip off...,"The series is simply amazing. But this offer is offensive -- why pay 200 bucks for seasons 1-4 together, when you can put the four seasons separately in your shopping cart for 160? I simply do not understand."
dvd,1 of 6,5.0,A Classic!!!,This movie is one of the best movie out there.
dvd,,4.0,Two myths meet within a century old anthropological myth,"What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as � The Old Curiosity Shop �. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,italians abroad,"Funny, enjoyable story of a gay Italian boy, born in Canada.

Someone, who apparently has not seen him, has issued a review saying that he inflicts pain and ""bullies"" the animal to show them who is boss. What nonsense. He empowers dog owners to take the leadership role in the owner/pet relationship. He is the most loving owner of animals that I have seen and his animals adore him. He takes throw away animals (he has about 40+) and has them in his dog compound. He exercises them and runs on the beach with them and they have a better life than many children in this country. "
dvd,7 of 10,5.0,july 18th can't come soon enough...,"Wow, when I found out about this, I freaked.  I can hardly contain myself because this DVD set is going to be amazing.  All of these films are great and they showcase Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson quite well.  The Warner Brothers Gangster Collection was stunning, so I'm sure this will be too; and the fact that the Film Noir Classics Collection Vol. 3 is released the same day...this is too much.  Thank you Warner Brothers!!"
dvd,1 of 4,2.0,Too many unanswered questions...,I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it
dvd,3 of 6,2.0,10.5 on the unrealistic scale,"One of the supporting actresses said it best in this movie, ""Forget what you saw on TV.""  The entire disaster is based on, well, make-believe.  "
dvd,18 of 25,4.0,Interesting Role-Reversal,"Basically, I think the underlying premise of this movie is pretty sad - that 2 people are having a secret rendevous to escape their mundane and pathetic lives and this 'rendevous' becomes their primary source of happiness. Yet this movie is fueled by great acting along with a musical score that really compliments, and the cinematography is top notch. This unrated edition is much better than the heavily chopped edition I recently saw on cable. For any woman ever dumped by a man, this is a MUST-SEE"

dvd,15 of 15,5.0,Reawakening the spirit,"This is a scenario not even Richard Feynman could have imagined when he helped to form Friends of Tuva. Thanks to this group's effort to bring Tuvan throat singers to San Francisco, Paul Pena was able to realize a dream that lifted him out of the depths of dispair and take part in the tri-annual Tuvan throat singing competition in Kyzyl.  This remarkable story not only tells the tale of Paul Pena, best known for penning Jet Airliner, but of the unconquerable spirit of Tuvans who for centuries were subjected to Chinese and Russian rule.  Deep in their throats they came up with a harmony that has beguiled musicians the world over.  But, it was Paul Pena who seemed to unlock the mystery to the western ear and not only take part but win over the Tuvan audience with his brand of kargyraa style singing.  The most amazing part of the story to me is that in order to learn Tuvan, Paul had to learn Russian in Braile in order to translate the words into English, since Tuvan was so rarely heard beyond the steppes of Asia."
dvd,7 of 10,5.0,Great DVD Treatment of One of Billy Wilder's Greatest Films!,"The super deluxe 2-disc DVD edition of the 1944 film noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (DI) rocks!  Director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, it even improves on the book.  The dark tone and scandalous subject matter freaked out Hollywood so much that it took 9 years to get DI from the printed page to the big screen.  Fred MacMurray was the only leading man in Hollywood with the guts to take the role of insurance salesman-turned-murderer Walter Neff, though even MacMurray needed convincing at first.  None of the other in-demand male stars of the period wanted Barbara Stanwyck's conniving, money-loving, hubby-offing temptress Phyllis Dietrichson to make a chump out of him.  Their loss!  (I'd first seen MacMurray when I was a kid.  Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY.  MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!)  "
dvd,,5.0,Vastly Underrated -- Best Boston Movie Ever,"Anyone who grew up in Boston in the 1980s and 1990s will tell you, this is one of the best Boston movies ever made and comes as close as a fictional movie can to feeling like, at times, a documentary (only ""The Verdict"" comes as close to capturing what Boston is all about).  It absolutely blows Good Will Hunting away.  (The film ""Southie"", while truly awful at parts, is actually better than most people think, starred a Dorchester native, and was written by another.  While it was set in NYC, ""State of Grace"" is a close cousin to this movie, but Monument Avenue does not have a ridiculous, horrible ending, which ""State of Grace"" unarguably did).  Believe it or not, Monument Avenue is in almost all ways actually a better film than ""Mystic River"", and it is much more evocative of Boston.  The guys in ""Mystic River"" are great characters but are obviously just that, characters, while the guys in Monument Avenue feel like the real thing, and few movies capture the dead-end, small-time criminal life of blue collar white NE ethnics better.  Monument Avenue is also beyond dark, the final montage that closes the movie is practically unwatchable to anyone who knew or was related to someone who was a part of what was going on in Boston at this time and features one of the most effective uses of stills and mood music in American cinematic history.  Charlestown is brought to life so vividly in this film that it is a character in the movie.  Everyone in the cast (except for a jarringly weak Colm Meaney) nails it.  Leary being great in this movie is no surprise (even though he is a hick from Worcester), but Famke Jansen is shockingly good.  The movie is based on what happened in the 1980's-1990's when gentrification hit Boston's Irish Neighborhoods and an epidemic of bar-room shootings took place in Charlestown, in full view of people, with no witnesses stepping forward (a prime motiviation behind most of the witnesses not talking was the desire to settle the score by killing the shooter themselves later on, or preserving the right of the victims friends or family members to do so -- the feuds in Charlestown were so widespread that over 125 murders similar to those in this film are said to have taken place in 10 years -- that is not a misprint).  Mothers Against Violence formed in response to this epidemic of murders and refusals to cooperate with the police in Charlestown (this is foreshadowed in the film during a funeral scene).  All of Boston's tougher Irish (at that time) neighborhoods -- South Boston, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, Hyde Park, Roslindale -- had a well-known unwritten code of silence and their share of feuds and unending cycles of vengeance, but Charlestown's was by far the most infamous, all-encompassing and unforgiving.  The best-kept secret to outsiders that are not from Boston is that Charlestown is, far and away, Boston's toughest neighborhood.  A powerful, elegant, and unfairly ignored film.  Truly spectacular"

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Argento's Directorial Debut is a Smash!!," Dario Argento's directorial debut brings us an intriguing murder mystery. Anyone fimiliar with Argento's works should be thoroughly pleased with this film. While it's not nearly as violent as his other slasher flicks such as ""Tenebre"", and not on the same level as that of ""Deep Red"" or ""Suspiria"", it doesn't lack in suspense or style. "
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,You gotta shop at Huckabees!,"Crude language, Wild philosophy taken to an extreme.  The attitudes and language are what makes this movie rated R.  Even though it may seem like all fun and games, and you may not want to say otherwise, you know it's more than that.  Looking at the title, it sounds like it could be another comedic happy go lucky film.  Right about the comedic part, but so wrong on everything else.  There are hearts broken in ways you wouldn't have imagined, two Huckabee models and ""everything else Huckabees.""  Jason Schartzman plays the main character, and I found out that he's the drummer in Phantom Planet, a great pop band!  (I hear he's arrogant though, and this fact only would enhance it.)  Dustin Hoffman and Jude Law are in it.  Mark Wahlberg is truly convincing in this one.  If you like South Park, Daria, or any kind of toilet humor, this movie may just be for you"

dvd,,2.0,Well that was tedious,"Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination."

I haven't ever bought a tape or dvd of any of the Star Wars stuff, but was intrigued by the idea of finally being able to see the orginals. The theatrical release on the bonus disc doesn't look too bad--especially at night in a dark room.

The episodes haven't aged one bit and are still as interesting as they were way back then. More and more stars started to show up by this season. Big names like Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt and Timothy Dalton appear in a few of the episodes. This season isn't about the gore and the dead coming back for revenge, this season mainly focused on the twist endings and murder plots more than the undead, not saying that there isn't any here because there is."

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A classic noir thriller.,"Otto Preminger directs this 1944 noir thriller starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  Dana Andrews plays McPherson, the hard-boiled detective investigating the shocking murder of a society woman, Laura, in New York.  McPherson focuses on Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a sardonic sophisticate who writes a newspaper column and has a radio talk show.  Lydecker was a good friend of Laura's but despised her playboy fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price). In  process of the investigation McPherson falls in love with Laura's portrait.  Fortunately for McPherson, Laura returns--apparently the body of the girl found in the apartment was not Laura!"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Great and Ghetto Spotlight on Baby Boy ,"Baby Boy is a good movie to me. I think the stars of baby boy was the R&B Singer/Actor Tyrese Gibson,Taraji P. Henson,Omar Gooding,Tamara LaSeon Bass,Candy Ann Brown,A.J. Johnson,Ving Rhames,Snoop Dogg,Angell Conwell,Kareem J. Grimes and Mo'Nique did a very good job on this movie. I think the director/writer John Singleton did a very good job on doing the movie too. The movie is a ghetto and street movie too."
dvd,,5.0,Love the commentaries,"I have been watching this DVD in 15-minute installments over breakfast for the last few weeks and am continually entertained. One of the best features is the commentary included for a half-dozen episodes provided by Stiller and various cast members and writers. At the wee hours of the morning it feels like the actors and writers are keeping me company while I watch the show. In terms of what they have to say, it is clear that the individuals associated with the show still think fondly about the program after so many years, and they comment lovingly about their favorite sketches and the whole experience of producing the show. The comparisons that Bob Odenkirk and David Cross (who wrote for the program) make between the Ben Stiller Show and Mr. Show are especially interesting. While Mr. Show is in many people's opinion (including Odenkirk's and Cross') the keener of the two programs, it apparently lacked the sheer joy that went into making the Ben Stiller Show. While some of the sketches don't pass the test of time, the enjoyment the cast brought with them to the show is still palpable. The only clunker in the commentaries is Janeane Garofalo, whose universe seems to be no broader than the Hollywood zip code, and even then she slips up, for example, confusing Yvonne DeCarlo (who played Lily Munster) with Carolyn Jones (Morticia Addams). Listen to the commentary to see what I mean"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Revenge of the Anti-Sith,"The spiritual opposite of ""Star Wars III - Revenge of the Sith."" Transcends sci-fi genre with a focused look at the essence of warriorhood, and what is sacrificed to create a ""perfect killer.""  The evolution of the Kurt Russell character is a touching transformation from a souless Storm Trooper to a true citizen soldier in the ideal American tradition. But there's nothing textbook preachy about it.  A lot of visual flash and pizzaz, considerable tension, and unpredictable twists because things could easily go either way, including the ending."
dvd,,4.0,Very good for viewers who don't always need to take sides,"What I like most about this film is its characters. There's a Harvard professor, a depressed psychologist, a good friend, and last but not least, a pretty, intelligent girl. Not to mention the main character, a genious with an extensive police record who seems to enjoy getting drunk and fighting on the street. "
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,When is Love Giving and When Is It Taking?,"This compelling, heart-breaking documentary shows a lonely single mother who adopts more and more children with special needs and lives in a constant state of being overwhelmed. The film asks the question: At what point does giving become a need that reaches a point of no return. For example, the mother's biological daughter cries in anguish when she realizes her life is about helping her mother care for the adopted children while her own needs are left ignored. The film offers no easy answers. Nor does the film paint the mother in a simple light. She is a complex woman full of complex motivations for adopting more than a dozen children. The filmaker is sympathetic and offers no judgments. He simply allows us to struggle with making our own conclusions. The children are presented in a noncondescending light. They are loveable survivors. One twelve-year-old boy however is severely angry, largely in part because his biological mother abandoned him when his health problems became too difficult, and he shows that he is a danger to the other children. He talks freely about wanting to kill them. His anger combined with his need to be loved puts the mother and the rest of the family in their biggest dilemma and is a major focus of this excellent documentary about a family that out of their daily crises grow a profound love for each other"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Really best of Riverdance!,"This wonderful DVD includes Riverdance 1st famous performance at Point Theater Dublin at Eurovision Song Contest 1994.

Plus Jean Butler's comments and lots of other interesting stuff, which every Riverdance fan should watch"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"Charming, romantic, fun","Gorgeous is a modern fairy-tale that blends traditional romance-comedy themes with Jackie Chan's trademark sense of action. A teenage country girl finds a romantic message in a bottle and travels to Hong Kong to find its sender. Though that doesn't exactly work out like planned, she does meet Chan's character, a millionarie industrialist. As the two get to know each other, a business rival plots to humiliate Chan by pitting him against an American fighter."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Surreal but with a touches on real emotions,"I thought that Scrubs would be a slapstick silly comedy, but I was wrong.  This show has developed characters who change during the years, mainly due to their rise in the ranks of the hospital.  One episode can have a surreal JD day dream, and yet maintain the emotional level about a patient's plight.  I know several doctors and it seems that the show is able to show the interns nervousness about being on call, making good decisions, etc. and still be side splitting funny.  I started watching during season 3 so the dvd gave me the chance to see it from the beginning.  Four strong seasons is more than most shows get. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Increasingly disturbing and compelling,"Bob Crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series Hogan's Heroes. However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life - sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess."
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Wonderful!,"The Dolls tore it up in this concert, period.  The band is extremely tight here..Steve Conte, Gary Powell, and Brian Koonin provide a very solid foundation for Arthur, David, and Syl.  The below review sums up my thoughts on each individual's contributions.  Brian held it all together as arranger.  Gary really makes things swing...great drumming.  Steve Conte is what Johnny Thunders would have been like sober and clean - I can't think of a better replacement for Thunders.  The (Dolby 5.1) sound is fantastic.  The guys look good and very happy to be together.  It just is very nice to hear these guys play so tightly and with so much conviction.  ""Jet Boy"" is the best version I have heard.  The liner note from David Jo is a wonderful reflection, very heartfelt and eloquent.  Great DVD, buy it!"

dvd,8 of 10,5.0,Amazing movie and special-edition DVD,"I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay! "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Non-stop suspense!!,"I started watchin Nip/Tuck flipping through channels one night, came addicted ever since.  The show definetly keeps your attention, they never focus too much on one character.  There is always something different going on.  If that is not enough to keep you coming back to watch it then how about two georgous doctors and beautiful women and what happens when they all come together.  If you are interested in adult mauture,(yet kinky) head turning surgeries and great mysteries of ""the Carver"" Nip/Tuck is definetly something you will want in your collection!"
dvd,3 of 8,4.0,"My &quot;I Love You, Alice B. Toklas&quot; Review","I Love You Alice B. Toklas really is a great movie. Peter Sellers, one of the best actors of all time, is excellent as a business man turned into a hippie all because of a drug-laced brownie. Although rated R it has very little language. If it were made today, it would probably be rated PG-13. It's also true that people don't give this film enough credit. If you like a good comedy or Peter Sellers, see this movie. You'll be glad you did. I hope it comes out on DVD"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,To the person who said this is not a classic........,"  Now, this movie may not have been known well when it came out in 1985, but, it's popularity grew as much as it has been shown on tv (Countless times).  Now, let's say that John Hughes produced this film;  I bet you that it would have been much better known if it had his name on it; Thus, at the time that this movie came out, John Hughes had some big hits under his belt (I.E. Sixteen Candles, & The Breakfast club to name a couple). If it had Molly Ringwald as the lead actress, then it would have been a bigger hit.  Joyce Hyser, however, wasn't/ isn't a VERY well known (If known) actress.  So, alot of people really didn't pay much attention to this movie.  I mean, what really big hit movies or starring roles did Ms. Hyser have really?  This and a few others were her ONLY starring roles. From what i've seen of her movies besides this one and another, she mostly had small parts.  Like, Does anyone remember seeing Ms. Hyser in the 80's classic ""Valley Girl""(Starring Nicholas Cage)?  The ONLY scene she was in was at the prom at the end asking ""Where are the cups?"", and, that was it.    "

dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Charley,"Imaginative story of a retarded young man who is given an experimental treatment that causes his mental function to improve exponentally over time.  The changes in his life style, experiences, relationships and capabilities are all sensitively depicted by an excellent performance by Cliff Robertson.  Clair Bloom, Sean Connery's exwife turns in a good supporting performance as well as providing a romantic subplot. "
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,Zinn is essential in understanding U.S. history as well as current world issues,"Known mostly for his bestselling masterpiece, ""A People's History of the United States,"" which recently sold its millionth copy, Howard Zinn is both historian and activist.  This dvd captures the legend at his best, connecting with his audience.  Having seen him speak live on three occasions, I feared that the film wouldn't capture his charisma, his passion.  To the great fortune of all his fans, this dvd delivers!"
dvd,,5.0,A picture of Hel,"In the back ground we see a picture of the Metropolis in 2026 that is watched over by Johhan 'Joh' Fredersen (Alfred Abel). He stole the heart of Hel from C.A. Rotwang, der Erfinder ""The Inventor"" (Rudolf Klien-Rogge) and married her. It was speculated that Hel fell for Joh's position of power more than love. Hel dies in child birth. "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,chilling: better realized than the book,"I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged."

dvd,14 of 14,4.0,Striking Film,"Kanal focuses on a small group of Polish resistance fighters during the Warsaw uprising of 1944.  Intended to last for a few days and to enable the Soviet Army to enter Warsaw, the uprising lasted for weeks while the Red Army did little to assist the Poles and was eventually crushed by the Germans.  This film is based on an actual episode of the uprising, the escape from encirclement of a significant number of resistance fighters by fleeing through the sewers of Warsaw.  Wajda follows a company of fighters into the sewers and explores their disparate fates.  In Wajda's hands, this episode becomes a metaphor for the whole Polish experience in WWII; brutal, valiant, deadly, profoundly humiliating but characterized by an unceasing pursuit of hope.  With fine cinematography and excellent acting, this is a gripping film. "

dvd,7 of 18,2.0,"Not in the same league as ""Special Bulletin""","The ""fake-news"" TV movie had already be done, and done better, ten years ealier as ""Special Bulletin"".  Where the first movie took its subject, nuclear disarmament and terrorism, seriously, this cheese-fest doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence at all.  They pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera.  Not of it ties together in any coherent way and the ""make love not war"" ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry"
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Reading each other--the reawakening of Carla Behm,"Work at SEDIM, an architectural firm, isn't a bed of roses for Carla Behm.  As its office assistant, she suffers from what the folk group the Shams called the file clerk blues.  Things are hectic, as she spends the day sending faxes, answering the phone, directing calls, taking messages, signing for packages, and having to deal with employees who dump their half-empty coffee cups on her desk.  She is hearing impaired, though, requiring two hearing aids that she can activate or deactivate, as she does during lunch.  There, she lip-reads and finds out how she's considered a loser and a joke.  She's homely and what man would want her?  More to the point, she's resentful that despite being talented and able to handle bids, her higher-ups get them and of course the commission from winning the bids."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Terrific Film Excellent Story,I didn't know what to expect before seeing this movie so I was kinda surprised about the subject matter.  However I loved it.  Bill Paxton really proved he is a great actor and film maker.  The young actors who play his children were flawless in their roles.  I think if my father claimed to be on a mission from god to destroy demons I would have reacted like the older kid did.  The whole religion thing really seems to freak people out so I guess that's why this movie never faired well in theaters.  People are too dang afraid of everything these days.  If they are so faithful then why would a little ol' indy movie shake their faith so much.  Anyway the movie is awsome and thensome
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A tip on which version to get,"If you can afford it, the newer Criterion Collection version (not the older one) is the best, in that it has a fine anamorphic widescreen transfer and a commentary by the director.  "
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,VERY interesting!,"I have read many books about eating disorders, and this is the first video I have watched. I enjoyed it and it brought the people to life, instead of just reading about them in a book. It follows a few girls during and after treatment for eating disorders. It brought me to tears a few times and helped me understand just how serious eating disorders are. I am more concerned about myself now, too. Do yourself a favor and take an hour to watch this video. It is well worth your time, whether or not you have an eating disorder or know someone who does."
dvd,2 of 17,2.0,Lame and corny,"When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies.  Now that twenty years have passed, all I can say is that it is so lame and corny that it's kind of embarrassing admitting that I used to like it so much.  Sure I still get a kick out of state-of-the-art (back then, at least) aircraft steaking all over the place, engaged in dogfights and all that... but that's about it.  The whole story is really half-baked, and not much good can be said about the acting.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, trust me, you haven't missing much and I'd recommend not wasting your time on it"
dvd,,5.0,Avatar is the kewlest show By; Big Noah x stid,"If there ever was a gut blasting, action packed season finale then this, my friend is it. from  The beutiful scenery of the northern water tribe, to the splendor of the northern air temple to the final showdown between Zhao and Zuko. this DvD has it all. The first season goes out with a bang here because there is tons of emotions and the promise of the next season is super. in this DVD the episodes are: "
dvd,4 of 10,4.0,Thoroughly Engaging! Expresses True Spirit of the Book!,"The film begins with gripping scenes and haunting music ... Fighter jets landing, powerful spiritual music that is sad and almost like a funeral - setting the tone for what is to come. Ben Affleck plays the CIA agent Jack Ryan to perfection. There is great casting for all the major roles and key characters in the book. Although in the book, the city of Denver is the location used by terrorists for the attack, the choice of Baltimore, Maryland makes sense, since there is a port which clearly can be the point of entry for contraband. The fact is the film remains true to the intentions and spirit of Tom Clancy's book. There is political maneuvering, espionage, edge-of-your seat gripping moments after the attack and a very well executed plot. Suspense builds and the story unfolds ... The topic is fascinating and timely. It is almost like the ""007"" films of old ... You more or less know what to expect, but the ride is so engaging, you are caught up in the drama and events."

It is both funny and tragic, though a bit exaggerated (but it's a MOVIE, where life circumstances do not have to be totally realistic). "

dvd,9 of 11,4.0,The Hot Spot,"Having bought ""The Hot Spot"" almost exclusively on the reviews of Jennifer Connelly's topless ""scene"" here on Amazon, I was disappointed in that respect.  This scene is outstanding but not worthy of the hyped-up reviews."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Wonderful Fantasy-Adventure That Will Thrill Children And Adults. Jennifer Connelly Is Superb In An Early Role. ,"This fantasy-adeventure film from 1986 is courtesy of four wonderful talents: Jennifer Connelley (""Once Upon A Time In America,"" ""The Rocketeer,"" ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Academy Award, 2001; hard to believe that she was just fourteen at the time), Jim Henson (""The Dark Crystal,"" TV's ""Sesame Street""), singer David Bowie (proving that he can act as well as sing; he should do more films) and George Lucas (the ""STAR WARS"" movies, ""THX 1138,"" ""American Graffiti,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" films, executive producer and writer). The story is well-crafted; no, I will not rehash it. SPOILER-I would have preferred some more sentimentality at the end of the movie-SPOILER OVER. Other than that, I really enjoyed it. Special features include the original theatrical trailer and a 56 minute, in-depth ""Making-Of"" documentary with reflections from the cast and crew. Rated PG for comic violence"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,'86 Mets ,The dvd box set is excellent.  It includes all 7 games of the 1986 World Series against Boston and the 19 inning divisional series game against Houston.

dvd,2 of 5,4.0,Reviews give away show,"I've enjoyed watching the series, and have been waiting for the third season to come out so I could watch it.  For those of you like me who hadn't seen any of the third season, be careful which reviews you read.  The review titled ""Descent"" basically gives the whole story line of season three, character by character.  It was a bummer for me since I'd managed to stay away from that information so far."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Seinfeld at its creative peak,"Seinfeld - Season 4 saw the sitcom grow from cult hit to national phenomenon. While a time switch to Thursday nights at 9:30 pm following the excellent sitcom, Cheers, certainly helped bring the show to a new audience, it was the writing and the rapport of the characters that had the masses coming back every week. Many fans, including Jerry Seinfeld himself, call this the show's best season and it's hard to argue this since every episode was so strong. The characters also developed to fruition as George became the ultimate neurotic while Kramer's popularity led to wild ovations upon his entrances. And like Season 3, many of the off the wall storylines came from the writers' experiences. "

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,crackling humor and sad ending makes a great film,"after seeing brokeback mountain, i decided to see more of ang lee's films and came upon this gem that perfectly shows the same type of sad melencholy used in brokeback. the film takes place in the 1970's and centers around two family's the hoods (consisting of kline, allen, ricci, and mcguire) and the carvers (consisting of weaver, wood, and that one kid) who go through many events that boil together one night during an ice storm.  the husband of the hoods is having an affair with weavers character, the kids are exploring sex and drugs, and allens character goes from shop-lifting to cheating on her husband too. the film plays out in two parts, the first hour or so is mainly a comedy while the last hour plays like a drama that leads to a very sad ending. truly a great ang lee film, must check it out if you loved brokeback"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"This time, there's more!","They say that sequels are always worse than the original, but this one is arguable.  ""Aliens"" is the sequel to the incredible masterpiece, ""Alien,"" and what a sequel it is.  In terms of quality, these two can't realistically be compared, because the original film falls under the category of suspense/horror/sci-fi, whereas this film falls more under the category of action/sci-fi.  This sequel doesn't have the same feeling as the first one, but it is, without doubt, a superb action film."

dvd,0 of 1,5.0,The Early Seasons are the Best,We watched these episodes rather quickly and are looking forward to the next season. This collection included the first Halloween special - by far the best reason to watch Roseanne. The timing of each scene is uncanny as well as the cast and how they relate together in the second season. This family is disturbed and lovable
dvd,4 of 4,2.0,Not So Wild: Yet Another Story That We Have Been Told 7 Years Ago,"So they still keep doing this, I mean, `two-sequel policy.' Get one surprise hit, and make two sequels, whether or not you need them. They did it to `Cube'; they did it to `Mimic': to `Species' 'Cruel Intentions' or so many countless examples. Of course, not all of them are bad (Wes Craven and his `Scream' trilogy for instance), but as far as `Wild Things' goes, we don't need any more. But here it is, another sequel `Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough' which is slightly better than the previous sequel, but still unnecessary.  "
dvd,,5.0,As Good as Season One--With More Twists--No Spoilers in This Review,"My son and I watch LOST together, one or two episodes at a time, on DVD to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on TV.  After we finished Season One, we didn't think it would be possible for Season Two to match it.  However, it did not disappoint.  It's hard to write a review of LOST without throwing in spoilers, but I'm going to try to give the essence of Season Two without ruining any of the secrets."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Hard to watch... but brilliantly moving and provoking,"I still don't know all what to say about this movie, since I only just saw it a couple days ago and its still simmering in my mind. But I do know it had a big impact on me. The way it was made, the way it showed you this world they lived in and how it was so quickly taken away. The movie isn't perfect, but for some reason I wouldn't change a thing. McJagger is dead on as Greta/George, and Clive Owen is amazing. Actually all performances in this film were excellent. And the title ""Bent"" is a word that means homosexual (as opposed to ""straight""), and certainly not referring to the shape of the main character's penis as was stated in a previous review. I don't know where they got that idea. the movie is hardly so shallow as to focus on such an insignificant thing as the man's penis when the emotional scope of the film is simply epic. 5 stars. see it if you can handle holocaust 'downers"

My son said hello & started to report what he had learned from the video.  They offered him a job (he's 4!) & subsequently invited him to visit their fire station.  He was thrilled!  A great, informative video for both kids & adults"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,This movie is awesome!!,"This is one of the best insomnia movies I have seen. If yo have ever lived for a period of time of constant sleep deprivation either from work or school or whatever, you will identify with the machinist. The entire movie is based on the surreal and confused world of the sleep deprived, and the estranged world that it can make you feel you live in."
dvd,7 of 23,1.0,Sentimental and fake,"Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?"
dvd,,5.0,One of the most creative and well done tv series in years,It's not often that Hollywood comes out with really original and poignant tv series.
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,ASTAIRE & GARLAND - NUFF SAID!!,"I'm typing away on this Easter evening while simultaneously watching Easter Parade on the TCM network. I haven't actually got the dvd so I can't comment on its transfer quality, special features, etc. I can, however, comment on the movie itself. I just want to let whoever's reading this know that Easter Parade ranks right up there with the very best of musicals. The backstory on this film is that Gene Kelly was originally slated to co-star with Judy Garland, but because of an injury, had to bow out. Enter Fred Astaire, who was in semi-retirement but who agreed to do the movie after having received Kelly's blessing. Easter Parade was so well received that a second pairing of Astaire and Garland was scheduled but due to Garland's (ahem) personal issues, that regretfully never came to pass."
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,On the Road to Classic Hillarity,"Bob Hope and Bing Crosby are one of the best comic duos, and these four brilliant works show it so well. I laughed, I sang along, and I laughed again. This is worth owning"
dvd,5 of 7,4.0,Very good satire tackling the tough topic of abortion,"Abortion is always a difficult topic to tackle, because its two extreme sides - pro-life and pro-choice - have a ""you're either with us or against us and there's no in-between"" mentality. Alexander Payne's Citizen Ruth is a political satire that does not take a stand on either side of the fence, instead choosing to remain neutral and expose the absurdities of each side."
dvd,13 of 14,5.0,Prophetic Chayefsky-Lumet Masterwork Accurately Foresees the Profit-Motivated Madness of Television,"With the primacy of reality programming on current primetime TV schedules and the fight for ratings even more virulent with the dismantling of the networks, the vitriol and perceptiveness of Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay for this searing satire resonates today more than ever. What gives the prophetic movie its power is how the story never veers that far from the truth, even in 1976 when the film was originally released. In fact, what may have seemed excessive back then has mostly come true, and that's the beauty of reintroducing this modern classic in a bountiful two-disc DVD package in 2006."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,What a surprise,"Imagine my surprise when I, not a huge Demi fan, happened upon this movie I'd never heard of one night on cable. Much to my delight I was hooked after about 10 minutes and it kept me on pins & needles the whole way through. This has to be the best acting I've seen from Demi, and the Angus/patrick character was also very good. Demi had such a powerfully vulnerable presence in the film, and you could literally see the different emotions come over her face like storm clouds as the events played out. It was like being on an emotional rollercoaster with her character - she really drew me in, made me care, and showed the aftermath of a child's death in a way that will haunt me long after the movie itself is over. That combined with the extremely suspenseful plot full of unexpected twists and scares, was a great combination that will leave you wondering at the end how they accomplished this with such a simply produced movie. A film this good should have been seen by u.s. audiences in the theatre. This is first time I've posted a review on a movie, so you can tell I felt strongly about this one!"
dvd,0 of 3,5.0,Thunderbolt The Wonderdog,"I also Love this movie! I got the VHS,but I want the DVD.I love the scene where The puppies are barking at Thunderbolt The Wonderdog.I wonder who will win between Krypto The Superdog and Thunderbolt The Wonderdog. I also loved the Saturday Morning TV-show. I loved the episode where Lucky saved Dumpling's life. I also loved the episode where Cruella had her own tv talk show and called the audience,a bunch of ""Gum chewing maniacs"" or something like that. and I forgot what she called Muldoona. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,This one's a keeper!,"We bought this DVD for my not-quite 2-year-old son, Caleb, who is enamoured with tractors.  He LOVES it!  He has watched it almost daily since we got it a few months ago, and it often holds him mesmerized for the whole 40 minutes (a marvel for a toddler).  You don't have to be a toddler to enjoy it, though...my husband and I found it quite entertaining (for the first dozen or so times we saw it, anyway), and Caleb's grandpa was also impressed.  "
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Challenging But Effective,"I was a little surprised at how challening the workouts on the DVD were, until I realized that there are multiple options and tons of variety.  A full workout is very tough and I would probably only recommend that for intermediates or advance.  Overall the workouts push you hard and do their best to stimulate actual class work.  Defintely recommend for those that want a results driven workouts"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Excellent, big hearted film","""That Frank, he lives inside of his own heart. That's an awful big place to live in."" "
dvd,,5.0,A fantasy,"This film depicts a story about a hunchback bell ringer of Notre Dame cathedral, Quasimodo, who lives alone isolated from the world. Not until one day he meets a beautiful gypsy dancer at the April Fool's Day party, Esmeralda, has his life begun to be different. He soon falls in love with her, so do Quasimodo's guardian, the archdeacon of the cathedral and a poor street poet. However, Esmeralda is in love with a handsome soldier. When the mob mistakes her for a witch, it's up to Quasimodo to rescue her and claim sanctuary for her in the cathedral."
dvd,14 of 16,5.0,A magnificent DVD of a magnificent movie (five stars doesn't begin to cover it),"It's hard to know where to begin with this one. A movie immaculately filmed by one of the greatest directors of all time, given just about the most perfect presentation I've ever seen on DVD. I guess I'll start with the print: it's magnificent, with beautiful, golden colors, sharp focus, and barely a speck of dust on the film. As one would expect with a Kurosawa film, the composition is a feast for the eyes, with beautiful formal balances coming from the most mundane of elements in a shot. (George Lucas was very influenced by Kurosawa in many ways, but this sort of beautiful, balanced composition is one thing he's never mastered.) Then there's the score. Most people might not immediately think of the score when discussing a Kurosawa film, but I was struck here by how powerful and distinctive it is, while at the same time it never gets in the way of the film. Then there are the sets: simple, yet used to maximum effect. This was not a big budget film by Hollywood standards (though it was the most expensive Japanese film up to that time), but it feels far more epic than any of the recent, very expensive Star Wars ""prequels,"" which just goes to show it takes more to make an epic than just money. Kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen, yet you'll think you're seeing far more."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Nothing But The Truth!,Like finding out your wife has been cheating on you the whole time you have been married.Painfull but worth it.
dvd,2 of 5,2.0,Even kink can be boring,"If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea. Howewver, if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject, then you are out of luck."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"""Cube"" has a classicly well put together screenplay held back by poor acting","After reading the very positive reveiws of this late 90's thriller I decided that it deserved at least a rental. I must confess that I am glad that I happened to stumble upon this movie on Amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be. The Screenplay was very put together, the plot & setting were intriguing yet mysterious & the killings (Or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy) & visuals are quite impressive for it's 500,000$ dollar budget. Now, the only real complaint that I can say about the film is that the acting is horrid. Now dont get me wrong not ALL of the acting was that bad but I would be lying if I said that most of the actors were okay, the truth is that most of them had very little experience and THAT made the film look all-around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an ELITE horror film. I think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Old fashioned cold-war drama with current world-situation simularities,"I remember seeing this movie when it originally aired . Good acting, good special effects (for its time, that is)It's amazing how this situation could actually occur during our present world situation. There has been incidences of ""compromised"" nuclear materials. Now Iran and North Korea among others are rapidly becoming nuclear-active. They say that movies are a reflection of real life. Who knew they could be prolific as well. Enjoy. My favorite saying from the movie...""Them ain't bogies, thems bandits!""...Powers Booth"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,awesome package,This is vintage hard to find stuff of the '79 series. This is when the Pirates were a class organization. Back when a Pirates fan had something more to look forward to than the start of football season. This dvd set is most the Pirates fans have to look forward to since 1992

dvd,16 of 19,5.0,Just Results,"Finally, an ab video that makes sense and works.  This video is truly innovative and unique.  Imagine having rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a crunch.  You have to see it to believe it!  Mike Griffith makes this video fun, easy to follow, and very challenging for the beginner or most conditioned athlete.  With a short amount of time and minimal equipment, this program will stretch and strenghten your abs in a functional way.  I am a physical therapist and I use these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for performance improvement for athletes.  I have been using it myself, and it works"
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,"Fascinating and subtle: essential viewing for cinephiles, philosophers, and artists of all stripes","This is a fascinating film on the nature of art, the relation between beauty and truth, the ethics of expertise, and on realism in cinema.  Having said that, I want to make clear that this is not a stuffy and slow artistic analysis of BIG ISSUES.  Welles pulls out all the stops to make it sexy and exciting -- he prepares us from the very beginning to see him as a cinematic magician, with a beautiful assistant, whose beauty (as in such magical acts) is used to distract the audience from the games he will play with truth and illusion.  An intriguing set of stories, well told, and beautifully shot, with the most masterful use of editing (for both sound and picture) techniques I've seen in any film (I understand that he and his crew were working almost exclusively on editing this film for over a year).  "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"""I Came Back to You""","Cold Mountain's chief appeal lies in the absolutely beautiful scenery and cinematography, and the love story between Ada, a preacher's daughter, and Inman, a Confederate soldier.  Filmed in the mountains of Romania, North and South Carolina, and Virgina, it is a relaxing pleasure to watch the seasons and the unspoiled beauty of nature.  It seems to have been the filmaker's goal to return to a pristine time before the environment became ravaged.  "
dvd,9 of 12,5.0,"A fun romp, give me a break","Who would take a movie called ""Cheeky!"" seriously? Come on, this is not a straight movie, it is just one big, fun party with an attractive set of cheeks."
dvd,,5.0,THE    RING  TWO,"The Ring Two is about a girl that wants to kill a boy. The characters are the girl, the boy, the mom, the dad. I like the movie because it is so scary that I had to watch it with some one bigger than me. I would recommend this movie to my friends. People who like scary moives would like this movie. I'll give The Ring Two two thumbs up."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A fourth season of great times!,"During this season,the inevitable happened. James Evans Sr.,portrayed by John Amos,was killed in an automobile accident. Amos was fired from GOOD TIMES in the spring of 1976 after a few offensive comments he made regarding the GT set. Joining the GT cast is Johnny Brown who plays the building superintendent. Brown's character is named Bookman. Bookman might have been mentioned several times in previous seasons."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,I loved it!,This movie is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen.  I've watched it several times and I never get tired of it.  A definite must for your DVD library.  Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock are great together.  It proves that you can have a great movie and not have all the sexploitive scenes.  A breath of fresh air and very funny
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great workout,"When I purchased this item, I was doubtful about the type workout I would be getting. To my surprise, it really had my heart rate up.......I recommend this product highly.  Just make sure you have a room with enough space to do all the exercises comfortably.  I am currently trying to re-arrange my room space....."
dvd,3 of 7,5.0,A MUST HAVE!,IF YOUR INTO GANGSTER OR MAFIA MOVIES THIS COLLECTION IS A MUST!
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Love It,"I loved this movie, and my daughter (almost 2) does as well. It's about learning to share, which Elmo eventually learns. The villain learns it too, which is a nice change. My daughter loves the songs, especially Venessa Williams. She likes imitating her by sticking her arms up in the air. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Intestinal Fortitude at its best!,Susan Surandon at her best! If you are a mother you will sob your guts out and this movie will stick with you for a lifetime. I do not recommend watching this when you have to get up the next day because you will be puffy and emotionally drained from the roller coaster ride you'll never regret viewing. 
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,DEGRASSI THE BEST SHOW EVER,"Heyy... well i guess you could say I'm addicted to degrassi. It faces real life situations that happen to teenagers in everyday lives without the overdose of drama.  I have learned so much from this show and it has really prepared me for my teenage years, from emmas internet encounter to when dean rapes Paige, or realizing your real idenity,abuse, diseases, little mistakes that can change your life and just about rumors gossip and lies. Its covers just about everything during your teenage years.  Its really great for people 12-18 i guess you can say. Im addicted to this show but i suggest if you want to watch it you try to watch all the seasons before just jumping right in because you won't fully understand and ecspecially since the-n jumps randomly all over the seasons when replaying old episodes So try to watch the 1st, 2nd and 3rd season before jumping in to the new season April 7th. Its pretty addicting me and my best friend LOVE this show and so do alot of other peple even they havent seen all the seasons or episodes. Its an addicting show and you'll probably fall in love with it after the first 5 minute"
dvd,,4.0,Decent,"I'm not huge into Yoga, but I knew I needed to increase my flexibility, and since I'm a ""plus size"" I figured this would be perfect.  It's not bad.  I am grateful for the modifications offered for the non-flexible and that they recognize that bigger people don't always move like thinner people.  For the absolute beginner, like myself, it's not too easy.  I wouldn't imagine that anyone who is intermediate and above would get much out of this one"
dvd,,5.0,Still the best,"This DVD outshines the previous ones in more ways than one.  As with all Criterion DVD's, you really cannot beat their version of this movie.  A must for all fans of ""Dazed and Confused"" and top-notch DVD's. "
dvd,25 of 26,5.0,Awesome!,This is my 4th Keli Robert's Step Fitness Video that I have purchased and it has quickly become my favorite.  I've been waiting for so long for Keli to come out with another Cardio/Step - Strength Training - as I've been doing the others for at least 5 years now.
dvd,6 of 9,4.0,Nice and simple!,"The star rating is for the music. Michael sings many popular songs and must face the possibility of being compared to the people that made tem popular. Many people in that position do funny things with the music, thinking that they have to make it unique; Michael does not have to do this (with little exception). He is just being his self and it is great just the way he is."
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Chaplin's satire on tyranny,"This was Chaplin's first all-talky picture, and the results are mixed. The movie is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people in high places squirm. "
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,Lady Chatterley's Lover,"One of the most important elements of this film is the sense of real life sensibilities it captures.   The qualities of longing and frustration are beautifully captured by Sylvia Crystal as Lady Chatterley, the wife of a dashing but complex husband played by Shane Briant with combinations of bravado and self centeredness beneath a handsome figure who is logged into his class background and behavior patterns allowing little room for natural love and responsiveness.   While Lady Chatterley holds firmly at first to her devotion to her husband she cannot withstand the raw sensuality of Nicholas Clay as the gardner on the estate.   Nicholas Clay likes to show his butt and I am reminded of another film, ""Evil Under The Sun"" where he tittilates the viewer with his rather voluptuous posterior while walking on the beach.  This aside, he more than captures the ""real world"" personality of his class and attitudes juxtaposed with Lord Chatterley's strict upperclass ones.  I felt the ""eye brows"" of Lord Chatterley were a bit ""over stated"" in make up and this had the effect giving him a drama queen demeanor and somehow a little ""campy.""  But all in all I thoroughly enjoyed the film for its showing nudity where nudity seemed perfectly called for without teasing and overly gauzy effects which is sometimes such a bore .   Maybe the film is not what one would call a ""religious experience"" but why should all films be that anyway.  It is beautifully filmed and the production values are first rate and it makes a sometimes complicated story line believable without too much contempt for the viewer, especially with D. H. Lawrence's reputation.  Above all I felt it captured the anguish and fear which contibute to decisions that drastically alter the people that make them."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,"""Do You Believe In The Soul?""","It doesn't have the instant charm of I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING, and Sheils Sim, the ingenue whose first film role this was, doesn't have the swanky, leading lady adorableness that Wendy Hiller radiates in IKWIG, and yet when all is said and done it may be A CANTERBURY TALE that you'll remember longer."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Director's Unrated vs. Original,"First of all, read the other reviews.  This is an historical account, not a fairy tale.  Now, having seen the the theatrical release and the director's cut both, I highly recomend the latter.  The additional scenes add to rounding out the characters and their ralationships"
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,"An overlooked,  excellent movie. ","  Maybe now that director Ang Lee is recognized for Brokeback Mountain,  people will revisit this fine movie which was sorely overlooked when it was released.  Maybe people do not like history anymore,  but this is a very honest and intelligent view of the Civil War that does not overlook the very real conflicting loyalties of that war.  The acting is top notch.  The relationships are well developed.   In other words,  this is not just another shallow war movie.  Toby Maguire gives a performance that tops his other more successful movies.  Just buy this movie!  It is such a bargain,  because so many do not even know about it. The best dollar I ever spent on a movie (the VHS version). "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,One of the best films ever...,"If you do not know this film, see it as soon as possible.  If you are already an Ozu fan, you either know or will find out, this is as great as his work ever gets.  This is quite simply, a deeply moving and poignant family drama that is one of the great works of world cinema. Splendid music and with Criterion, the best transfer possible.  One can return to this movie many times over the course of a lifetime and find new rewards with each viewing. For the open viewer, it will provide a quietly overpowering experience"
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,Great find!,"This is a great DVD to pick up if you want to start getting in shape. The instructor really helps you to tone you're your whole body without exercise equipment. I also noticed it helps with relieving stress as well and is easy to understand with helpful tips. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This DVD has given me better posture, balance, and stamina. I would definetly recommend this to anyone"
dvd,4 of 10,2.0,Is this chicken or fish I'm eating?,"With that one line, Jessica Simpson went from being a D/C grade level celebrity to being one of the most beloved, well known airheads.  The show itself was kind of lame, neither she nor Nick is the sharpest tool in the shead, but they at least have a few entertaining moments here and there.  I don't care for reality TV shows at all, but I gave this one a shot.  I gave it 2 stars for the chicken or fish comment, and that one scene where she spent $2000+ on underwear and pissed him off.  Otherwise it was just another show that you watch because it's on"
dvd,8 of 10,2.0,"""Come on and give it a go for the Soviet Union, eh blokes?""","Honestly, the only line missing from this film is:"
dvd,3 of 21,2.0,"beautifully shot, poorly acted, terrible dialouge","i really like the aesthetic of this film, but not much else.  the dialogue in particular is really trite.  the characters are all hackneyed caricatures - john lurie as an unconvincing pimp, tom waits as a burnt-out DJ, and roberto benigni as a crazy italian guy.  i didn't believe these might be real people for one second - they are very clearly ""characters"".  the film is beautifully shot in black and white, but jarmusch leaves out a few things that would make this film more convincing.  waits and lurie meet in prison after each was set-up for different crimes, but the film never delves into why they were set-up.  we see very little of the prison aside from their cell.  we don't see the escape until they're in the tunnel.  we never see any police or dogs, we just hear them.  the coming together of nicoletta and roberta is ridiculous.

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Eye Candy for the Senses,"While there's little to add to Alejandra Vernon's spot-on Amazon review of this movie, there's something to be said for echoing certain of the sentiments she shares in her review and the particular scenes that make this movie sparkle. "
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,False advertising,"I remember when this came out on video, I was managing a video store and expanding my reading of military history out of WWII and into other areas- Korea, Vietnam, WWI, etc. Hoping for a high-quality film of the battle of Heartbreak Ridge in Korea. Ended up with made-for-tv feel of boot camp, and then the dramatic climax in.....Grenada. Yep, Grenada. Admittedly, that's all they had to work with, but still I get the feeling that Clint would like to forget this movie more than I would. That being said, if you just want to see some really accurate uniforms and a few war-movie cliche characters, by all means invest your time. For a better time, check out the 1959 movie ""Pork Chop Hill"" produced and directed by Gregory Peck. Although full of heavy-handed evil godless commie sterotype imagery, still much better than this one here."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Riverdance-Live from New York City,I really like it.  Colin Dunn is a great Irish Dancer and it is wonderful to watch him.  The whole show was put together great and flowed well.  Jean Butler was very good as always along with everyone else.   You could tell people were having fun.
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Truly great baseball movie,"A fictional story that captures the essence of minor league baseball in a small town in the 1950's. William Russ (Roy Dean Bream) is great as an aging pitcher, whose dedication and love for the game contrasts with the flippant and immature attitudes of some of the younger players. Glenn Plummer (Tyrone Debray) portrays a 17 year old black pitcher making his start in the minors. Roy Dean becomes friend and mentor to Tyrone. Russ's character has a health condition that is kept secret, revealed in the end of this poignant story. The baseball action is realistic, rare in baseball movies"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,NOONEMENTIONS THE PERSECUTION AND BLACKLISTING OF CHAPLIN AT THIS TIME,"One driving force behind this film before CHaplin's exile from the USA back to EUrope is his hounding by the congressional Un-American activities witch hunting of the time which branded Chaplin as a leftist because of his sympathies with humanity and the poor and his courageous stand against our then fashionable fascist political persecutions. For a flavor of the times, watch Goodnight and Good Luck, or The Front. This is what drove Chaplin away forever, only later to receive an honorary reward which he had long deserved but only belatedly received when politics in America permited a bit more breathing room and reality and artistic freedom."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,THE MAN AND THE LEGEND COME TOGETHER,"Don Siegel gave The Duke, and us, a wonderful gift with this, an absolutely essential and personal film.  THE SHOOTIST is based on a novel by Glendon Swarthout inspired, in truth, by the life and legend of John Wesley Hardin, but the parallels to John Wayne's own twice-fought battles with cancer make it hit very close to home.  And it helps make THE SHOOTIST a perfect, inspired coda to an extraordinary career.  In actual fact, the filmmakers thought Wayne too ill to be able to do the part of John Bernard Books, and so offered it first to George C. Scott.  Scott agreed to play the role, but when everyone learned that Wayne not only wanted this part but was beginning an active campaign to win it, Scott stepped aside for the great man.  Ron Howard, in his last film role before turning entirely to directing, plays the young man enamored with the romance of the gunfighter who learns just what the reality of the life was; Lauren Bacall plays Ron's mother, at first wary of the aging shootist but eventually a helpmate and confidant; James Stewart shines as Wayne's doctor, trying to help him through the pain with only the remedies of the time; Harry Morgan plays the local sheriff, anxious for the great man to leave this life and make his own life easier.  The rest of the cast is filled with character actors all making their own very personal marks, from Richard Boone to Hugh O'Brian to Bill McKinney to Scatman Crothers to Sheree North to John Carradine.  Beautiful photography by the brilliant Bruce Surtees and music by western veteran Elmer Bernstein help make THE SHOOTIST one of the great films, and one you can't divorce from legend.  "
dvd,5 of 8,5.0,Real people worth watching,"I'm a fan of reality television even though the contestants on Survivor and Big Brother are in a completely artificial situation, as far from reality as can be.  Yet nobody is writing their script; they are writing that themselves.  These comments are also relevant to this excellent documentary of young Bob Dylan on tour in England in 1965."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,why the bare bones version,"I had been searching for this dvd for about 3 years now and had no luck as it was out of print. Then finally I found it and at only 9.99   But then again this is Universal were talking bout here, so why have such a goregous movie and do a bare bones version. There was no menu what so ever and nothing extra at all. I would be willing to pay more for a special edition.  The movie itself wal extra sharp looking and the audio was outstanding the big plus is that it was wide screen. Universal people dont care for cheap dvds when they are bare boned versions"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Hell at it's best,"This was a funny movie that if you failed to laugh at can only mean you've lost your sense of humor. It was unique and the references to ""Happy Gilmore"" are certainly fun."
dvd,1 of 4,2.0,Poor,"I'm a Van Damme fan but this movie sucks real bad, only good parts are the fight scenes at the end of the movie, perhaps the last 10 or 15 minutes. Buy it only if you can get it for like 7 bucks"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A powerful novel turned into a powerful film,"I am a big fan of Stephen king's writing. When I read the green mile I was amazed at how unlike King's other works it really is. No blood, gore, or fangs. Just the true spirit of a good man placed on death row for the crime that another man commited. Tom Hanks's performance as paul Edgecomb is first rate, and Michael Clarke Duncan turns in a fantastic performance as John Coffey. This film will make you cry. Not beacause of death, but for the good in one man's heart"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Good overall on the edge of your seat  video ,this movie is a great movie for those how like movie on millitary and sub's. this movie keeps u thinking all the way through it and wondering what will happen next.Sean Connery as always was a great actor in this film and so was Alec Baldwin. I would just sugest it to just about anyone and definetly military lovers. 
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Four Dead Batteries? They seem fully alive to me!,"For a movie called ""Four Dead Batteries"" could you really expect so much laughter and lively emotion to come from it? Well you better. First of all, this is a film that is begging to be watched. Are you tired of the hollywood crop of romantic comedies? I am. Are you tired of most indie romantic comedies? Even more so."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"""Those guys are fags!""","Fast Times is an 80's comedy directed by Amy Heckerling (Look Who's Talking), and starring Sean Penn (Mystic River), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Road To Perdition), Brian Backer (Moving Violations), Judge Reinhold (Beverly Hills Cop), Phoebe Cates (Bright Lights Big City), and Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian)."
dvd,,5.0,Top-Notch Giallo,"While most films that fall under the Giallo banner are far more style than substance, this one rises far above all of that.  Among Dario Argento's finest works, it is an eerie psychological thriller which is part Hitchcock, part Raymond Chandler novel, and part Cinecitta.  The story is believable and captivating, the suspense is chilling, the acting is superb.  Of course there's great music, with Ennio Morricone at the helm of the sounds, and of course there's all kinds of good-looking people, cool cars, and stylish set pieces, just as you'd expect from an Italian film from 1970.  But with this film those extras are minor attractions, and the film itself is what keeps you watching"
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,Patience is rewarded,"I knew I should have waited!  I got impatient and bought the Masterworks DVD and after watching it once could not bear to see it again, the colors were that awful.  Of course I have to get this, but it's still galling."
dvd,2 of 4,4.0,Bitter Sweet,"Talk about a late comer.  Obviously, I just saw the film, made years ago, and highly doubt many will read this.  I am still compelled to write this though - I've been disturbed since I saw the film.  All the reviews were helpful to some degree, as I crave different view points.  One thing that was never mentioned and I thought of at the end of the film is that the abusive father beat and finally killed Bobby.  The imagination of Mikey placed Bobby in a fictional ""better place"", flying away in the mystical Radio Flyer, and later living an adventurous full life.  Other tidbits: I don't believe a father would tell his sons (at that age) the truth if it was death at the hands of abuse or suicide; Mikey, now an adult reliving his horrible childhood, would of liked it to have really ended that way; Bobby was too young to survive alone in life - even IF the successful flight of the Radio Flyer was to be believed; a mother, as loving as this one was portrayed, would, without a doubt notice either bruises, or a change in her son's personality - something. Finally, I could not swallow that a mother, even one as dependent on a man as this one was, could EVER take the man back after a child you love is beaten half to death!  Ok.  I'm done.  Guess it's hard to make a movie with such sensitive subject matter.  I loved and hated the film, hence the title ""Bitter Sweet.""  P.S.  I do believe there were 2 boys, Hanks is portrayed quite sane. And I love animals.  I was so glad he (Hanks) also pretended that Shane survived his beating....and my lord, the acting was incredible"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,fire fox was very exciting!,it was one of very impressive movies which i've watched.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Pelham 123 to Command Center: Your Train Has Been Taken,"I first saw this on TV when I was 15 in 1979. I liked it then and I like it now on DVD. I will agree with some other reviewers who complained about the lack of special features, but that's really not a big deal. WARNING: This IS an R-rated film with gun violence & gross profanity."
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,not a good movie as the reviewers here say it is,"I just saw this movie on IN HD2.  Some people said that this movie is a hidden gem.  At first, I felt the same way.  I didn't even know such a movie existed.  Then after about 30 minutes, the movie became really boring.  It just drags on with a weak synopsis.  The cast includes some famous actors and actresses, and I think they are pretty good actors, but without an interesting storyline, the movie is a boring piece of work that leaves no impressions"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,I wish I was in Dixie...,"This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in ""Gods and Generals"", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case."
dvd,,4.0,Columbo - The Complete Fifth Season,"If you are a Columbo fan, you will enjoy season five. I own seasons one through five, and enjoy them all. If you are type of person who likes extras such as bloobers or interviews, you won't find them on this DVD. The only extra is an episode of Mrs Columbo, which really isn't necessary. It's not hard to see why that series didn't last"
dvd,2 of 9,5.0,wolf's rain,"I have seen plenty of anime, but out of all of them, Wolf's Rain is by no doubt the best.  The plot is very well written and keeps you interested till the end.  Dont listen to those who tell you the Wolf's Rain is a stupid and simple plot because its not.  Its only stupid and simple if you don't understand it.  To get most enjoyment out of Wolf's Rain, you would have to know a bit of Japanese mythology, but its not necessary to still love it.  Sadly, the final episodes aren't out yet and those are the saddest you will ever see.  All of the characters except Kiba die off in the saddest ways imaginable, and the ending leaves a lot of open ends for you to consider.  I would give Wolf's Rain a 10 out of 5 if possible"
dvd,,5.0,great learning dvd,My son learned a lot from this dvd.  He was able to repeat and identify letters of the alphabet easily.  We liked it so much we sent it to a friend
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Not the Barbara I Remember!,"In the 1968 NOTLD (if you havent seen the original please watch before you watch this version) the character of Barbara was a scared, stunned,  stereotype of woman. The men were the strong protective ones, while she cowered and Meeped and covered her face. In this 1990 version, Barbara kicks undead bootatie like she was born into it. We think that Barbara (played by pat tallman) is mousy with her giant glasses, muted shoulder pad outfit and the 10 minutes of screaming in the beginning but soon with Bens (Tony Todds) presence of mind she changes into an assertive leader who becomes the lone voice of reason till the end of the movie. This version mimics the original, They even tried to cast people with the exeption of Barbara who looked the same. Bigger budget and color makes this a worthy remake, although to me the black and white one was much creepier. Tom Savini on the featurette explains that they tried to make everything look as real as possible anatomically, when they used dummies instead of stunt people we were not supposed to tell, and for the most part he got it right except for two instances"
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,An Important American Film...,"...but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this DVD is made was a poor one, and Alpha Video, the distributors of this classic Capra movie, made no attempt to clean it up."
dvd,,5.0,Great Stephen King Mini-series,"Out of all of Stephen King's television works, I think this one is his best.  Great cast, great setting (Maine island in a brutal blizzard), and great concept--mysterious man enters an isolated setting and begins killing people until the town gives him what he wants."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Totally Entertaining,"Like the other reviewers, I was totally entertained and enjoyed the movie immensely.  Plot is farfetched and unbelievable, but the movie succeeds in suspending disbelief enough for you to enjoy the movie anyway.  Yes, the dwarf stole the show -- she is awesome.  But Kathy bates IS the heart of the movie.  Another excellent performance from her, AND Rupert Everett.. who never disappoints.  I Tivo'ed this movie, but now I am getting a DVD to keep"
dvd,,4.0,Nice and interesting,It's a nice 'chick flick'.  I like the way it plays out and I like the actors.  It's worth owning
dvd,,4.0,Good film.,"I watched both films, ""The Innocents"" and this one when I was eleven year old. I still think ""The innocents"" is superior because the author Henry James is pretty superior than Shirley, but this film is truly scary because Shirley copied the idea of Henry James that the fears is inside our minds, when you use this statement you can create such an environment where the majority of things is in our imagination and increase a lot with no limit depending on how sensible you are to these facts. Buy this film ""The Innocents is superior"", but this is better than any scary film based in blood and gory"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Performace With The Stregth of a Tiger,"My parents took me too this and I had once seen riverdance when i was younger and was amazed, but at 16 i thought it would be dumb. Was i wrong! This was the most amazing performance I've seen in my life, looking at it on DVD still gives me and my family goosebumbs its that amazing."
dvd,,5.0,I love this show,This was one of the best shows I ever seen and sadly it didn't last long. Instead of having a case solved at the end of every epsiode Murder One was about one major trial with all the twists and turns you'd expect with a big case (and many you don't) it was very exciting. I tuned into every epsoide right until the end. The writers were very good at keeping it from getting to dull or boring and the cast was wonderful.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Time to Kill,If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you.  It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause
dvd,3 of 14,2.0,Mccourts of New York,"Very disappointing.Disjointed effort on behalf of a McCourt nephew. Seems  more like a school project rather than the touching journal that resulted  in Angela's Ashes. Some frames are out of focus(not an effect). Too much  focus on Malachy, not even-handed. Turned a well-intentioned story into a  drudgery. Not even enough photos that would have made the difference"
dvd,9 of 10,4.0,HAIR RAISING FUN,"THE BIG TEASE is the second movie I've seen in the past year about a hairdressing competition.  The other is the likewise little known BLOW DRY.  BLOW DRY is a little more accessible as it has a more in depth plot line and characters.  However, THE BIG TEASE is a ""mockumentary"" with soul and a droll sense of humor.  Craig Ferguson marvelously plays stylist Crawford Mackenzie, a Scotsman who mistakes a form letter for an invitation to participate in the annual Platinum Scissors award competition in Los Angeles.  Once there, he finds out he's only invited to be in the audience, and the competition's officious chairperson (a delightful Mary McCormack) refuses to let him enter.  Mackenzie stumbles onto Sean Connery's agent, played very nicely by Frances Fisher, and one thing leads to another and kaboom, Mackenzie finds an ally.  The supporting cast is top notch:  Donal Logue as the wannabe actor with his own limousine; David Rasche (Sledgehammer) as the Norwegian three time champion; Ted McGinley (underused) as Rasche's buddy; and some nice cameos from David Hasselhoff and Drew Carey.  The outcome is predictable but the movie has such a nice low key approach to its subject matter, it's delightful.  The final four hairstyles are priceless, too!"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Sometimes they Come Back,"The film is based on a short Stephen King story about a teacher who returns to his old home town to take up a job. The problem is, there is too much history there and bad memories. His brother was killed by hoodlums way back when they were younger, and the hoodlums were then hit by a train on the same day.  Now the hoodlums have returned to finish off the brother. Sounds ridiculous but it works.  Everybody can see these guys but nobody believes the teacher when he tries to convince them that they are very evil.  It has a very eeery feeling to it, and remains one of my favs from the early 90's.  "
dvd,0 of 4,4.0,DVD movie.,The DVD is a great movie. It was packed good and got to me
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,XD,"I don't even like Farley (rest his soul) but I loved this movie!  It was hilarious!  And I think what made it better was the amount of character development in it, both Haru and his brother (the guy that played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat).  A great buy"
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Excellent,"All three of the titles in this series are excellent.  The second in the series, To Play the King, is my personal favorite, showing equal sides of the coin; evil, corruption and greed vs. caring, benevolence and giving.  Absolutely worth watching, more than once"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,It's worth being alive to see this movie,"I never thought of reaching 40 years old to rediscover, in a film, just what we are doing here as humans, in such a clear, bright and open way. Just like in reality, in this film there are no main characters. They all are, we all are main characters. Rich, poor, men, women, happy, outsiders, truthful, hypocrites. No concessions to distinction. In every moment, all characters fully representing their roles, no matter are they in the foreground or in an almost unperceivable corner of the screen. Welcome, 1939 Jean Renoir, welcome to our future. ""Stop the masquerade!"", so we say to our politicians, to the media and to ourselves. ""Which one of them?"" is the universal answer, one of the several universal impulses of this delightful, adorable movie and of their loveable characters. That's why I end up with a classic travel-agency like clich: Enjoy life - see La Rgle du Jeu"
dvd,13 of 17,1.0,Where's the bass?????????,"In both performances, the mix has rendered John Entwistle's bass inaudible.  It sucks.  The only place you can hear it is during the solos in Underture from Tommy and 5:15 from Quadrophenia."
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,VERY ORIGINAL PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA,"This is a film that is a bit over analyzed. When I first saw the film, I really didn't care about the analytical makeup of the film, but was more intrigued with the story of a very troubled teenager: Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal). With a very original script, and great acting, the film is a bit difficult to label as a genre. So I won't label it. Donnie is living his own reality in this film, and although I have not seen the Director's Cut, nor do I wish to, the original is very good as it is. "
dvd,7 of 10,4.0,Firm to Fitness Ball Workout for Dummies - Good Stuff!,"This DVD is great and very user friendly for the novice using a fitness ball, yet the routine is still challenging. As you go through the routine, the exercises are simple but they always offer you a more challenging version of the same exercise for those more advanced users of the fitness ball.  I would definitely recommend this as a good, solid exercise routine and to build confidence in the program.  I will continue with this one but ready to purchase others too in order to mix my routine up.  Thank you"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Liberty's too precious a thing to be buried in books!,"First, one thing I love about this movie is recognizing the actors that were in another classic Jimmy Stewart/Frank Capra film called ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (you may have heard of it!).  Actors like Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, and HB Warner all have parts in both films with Jimmy Stewart and they all have one thing in common: greatness.  Add to that great performances by Jean Arthur and Claude Rains, and this may be one of the greatest American underdog stories of all time.  What makes this great is that the story unfolds slowly but perfectly, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you think that Jimmy Stewart can't possibly overcome.  As he delivers his speeches, the words are really touching and that says a lot about a movie that came out over 65 years ago!  This is one of those timeless movies that must be watched and should be required by high school Government classes on a rainy day.  Jimmy Stewart proves he is one of the greatest actors of all time (my personal favorite!).  Few movies can entertain as well as captivate as well as give you goosebumps, but this is one of those movies.  A pure classic"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,school teacher and mom of 3,We LOVE this video and with three kids in the house someone is asking to watch it everyday! I don't mind because it is happy and makes you want to get up and dance. Within a week our kids were racing to get to see who could get to 20 first and that is great because other videos stop at 10. This concept has also laid the ground work for showing how higher numbers are 'put together'-How awesome is that?! Because 123's has been such a success we went out and got the ABC's video-thanks Brainy Baby
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Quite possibly the best ghost story ever put to film,"A music professor moves into a lonely old Victorian mansion in order to put his life back together following the death of his family. In what seems like the ideal setting for rest, relaxation, and a place to concentrate on his music, soon turns into a setting for disturbing sounds, voices, and eerie images. Just what is contained in this house, and what does it want? The usual outstanding performance from George C. Scott, as well as top-notch writing and directing, contribute to the power of this quiet, spooky chiller. Highly recommended."
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Oldboy - Oh Boy,"Ok wow. This film is messed up. It totally left me speechless. Oh Dae-su, a Korean family man is forcefully imprisoned for 15 years with no explanation. Upon his release he sets out to revenge his captors and understand why it all happened. What ensues is a hardcore psychological thriller with plot twists, cool fight scenes, a superb narrative style, and sweet cinematography. This film went gangbusters on the festival circuit pulling down some prestigious awards, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's mainstream. Bring this film to any conservative mother and you will see one of two things: a forceful backlash or a permanent nervous twitch from trauma. The film is stunning, but I recommend it only to people with their mind wide open"
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,"""TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!"" ","It's the undisputed heavyweight champ of frat-boy movies. Many erstwhile pretenders to the throne have come and gone (Porky's, Screwballs, Revenge of the Nerds to name but a few) but none of them have come close to matching this slice of genius from John Landis. Even today, many years after it first came out, Animal House still stands head and shoulders above the competition. Like its undoubted star - the late John Belushi, Animal House is loud, stupid, vulgar and more often than not: uproariously funny. As well as its influence on those who shamelessly copied the formula for their own efforts; the film's larger-than-life celebration of youthful excess also spawned a craze for drunken toga parties and food-fights in college campuses across America. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A modern day horror movie,"Frailty is a modern day ""the Exorcist"" or ""Psycho"", meaning that it is very good! The majority of the horror movies coming out these days are extremely unoriginal, have a horrible plot, bad director, and really bad actors. They just aren't worth the time or money. But this is one of the best horror movies of the last decade for sure. It is definitely worth the rental price, or try and see if you can catch it on TV sometime. You will probably want to buy it afterwards, I did. It is absolutely a creepy movie and I promise you will love it"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Interesting Video,"I actually saw this video at a Hi-Fi Show and was amazed by the special effects and graphics!  Now, after I have watched my own copy I still feel the same.  This is a good video to watch because it is entertaining and the music is energetic.  I like to see the creators' creativities and glad that they have put out a second dics with more advanced effects and graphics"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Glorious and Sumptuous Early Verhoeven,"Awesome!  Great performances, cinematography, score and of course direction.  Brilliant and realistic period film about a young girl struggling through poverty stricken Europe in the late 1800's in the Netherlands.  The ending may seem abrupt to some but it does thankfully end on a happy note"
dvd,2 of 3,2.0,DON'T GIVE ME THIS BREAK,"Made for TV movies can be fun, and if they're done with a proper amount of sophistication, worth viewing.  This CBS TV movie is not one of those however.  The sharks are hardly seen and when they are, it's not with any great amount of technical finesse.  As expected, most of the college students act like pre-schoolers and unfortunately most of them aren't good actors.  Shannon Lucio and Riley Smith stand out, but Justin Baldoni has little to offer but some nice pecs.  With the tons of shark attack movies available, why couldn't this one try a little something different.  And yes, I'll forgive the talented Kathy Baker and Bryan Brown for being the main adults in the movie.  Exposure is always good and so is the paycheck"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Great actors , great feel and good story, A must buy.","I'm a big Kevin Spacey, 'the actor' fan. He plays his role in this movie very well as he does with all of them. Helen Hunt  also plays her part very well, and the young man(Name??-he was the kid in The Sixth Sense) is very talented and is the focal point of the entire show and does an excellent job. It's a movie that makes you feel good at worst. Don't pay it back, pay it forward in goodness. A great 'golf caddy' and human being who is no longer with us named Harvey Penick wrote: ""Never talk bad about anyone, it only stirs resentment. Speak no ill of anyone and all the good you know of everybody. And remember, never judge a person too soon. God waits until the end"". A very humble man who 'walked the walk'.  If we could all live that kind of life everyday wouldn't it be a wonderful world. Buy it. It's a keeper. Adults and kids both."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Just beautiful,"I too have kept this movie in the back of my mind for some time.  It truly is a love story.  It shows that not all love is tied in pretty bows and survives time and space, but shows us that while love is alive it should be experienced and then cherished for all time"
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Get out you note book,Randy Bodek (Patrick Dempsey) is a slacker and his father decides not to support him any more due to bad grades. Mean time his girl (Nancy Valen) also things he is insensitive. What his he to do? While delivering pizzas he has a chance encounter with a beautiful mysterious woman Alex (Barbra Carrea). She is the kind that kisses and tells. So how will this encounter change Randy's life and those around him?
dvd,1 of 3,2.0,Boring Fluff,"I recently gave this movie another shot, at the request of a friend.  I was impressed, this time, with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography.  It's as if every scene could be a postcard, and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing.  And the songs are great, if a little ""forced"" into the movie."
dvd,8 of 20,1.0,I'M SORRY... I FIND THIS BADLY WRITTEN. spoilers!,"Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned."
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,A masterpiece with Denzel at his best!,"This movie is based on reality in which the boxer Ruben Carter was wrongfully accused of murder. It shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible. Just because Carter was black, he was imprisoned. This film is remarquable and Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic as Ruben Carter. It shows his wrong accusation, the racism, and his descent into madness in prison. It's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending. Ruben Carter is helped by a group of Canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison. It's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone. This movie is up there for me with films like the Shawnshank Redemption and the Green Mile! Highly reccomended"
dvd,,5.0,An Action Genre Masterpiece,"Commando is likely the ""magnum opus"" of the 80s action genre."
dvd,31 of 36,4.0,the best in all seven 50 movie collections,"There are about 6 another genre boxes from this studio and I have 4 of them, Most of them has Cheap and B movies with owful qualities that you cannot watch most of them although you can say that you have a Huge collection of classic movies!"
dvd,18 of 32,5.0,"Seven down,one to go","Are you ready for more adventures of apartment 201 and its occupants Jack Tripper,Janet Wood and Terri Alden? Cindy Snow is now history(Jenilee Harrison who joined the Three's Company cast in late 1980 was written out after 1981-82). Here's what happens this season. Jack(the late great John Ritter) joins Janet(Joyce DeWitt) and a male business associate in a dinner date. Jack was ""under the weather"" at the time and winds up so drunk that after he and Janet return home,he juggles and shatters Janet's heirloom vase that was given to her by her grandmother. Jack takes his toothache to Terri's(Priscilla Barnes) boyfriend dentist Dr. Phil Greene(Jeffrey Tambor,star of Fox's Arresting Development and late of the TC spinoff The Ropers and HBO's The Larry Sanders Show). Phil,whose clientele are grade school children,gives Terri an engagement ring one night after dinner but they wind up breaking up. Phil even accused Terri of having an affair with Jack. Jack thinks the blind date his upstairs neighbor and buddy Larry Dallas(Richard Kline) set Jack up with got Jack in trouble(this girl accidentally reached the trio's newly purchased answering machine,also she and a male friend are diamond thieves. She planted the diamonds inside Jack's jacket pocket while she kissed him). Larry met this girl and admitted that he fixed Jack up with somebody else. Larry also said he'd never dump a beautiful girl like the diamond thief whose name is Rita. A columnist named Hank Thompson who has a date with Janet,interviews the trio and writes a column that turned many people off,including a girlfriend of Jack's(she broke their date to attend a carnival). The trio's landlord Ralph Furley(the late great Don Knotts and late of The Andy Griffith Show) talked Hank into printing a retraction(Ralph told Hank that Jack was a homosexual). Then there's the birth of Jack's Bistro,Jack's longtime dream that finally came true. Jack,still employed as a chef at (Frank)Angelino's,is given the opportunity of a lifetime by Frank(Jordan Charney,recurringly). Jack's Bistro is housed in another piece of Frank's property. Jack withdraws most of his money from the bank to open the French cuisine eatery. But it almost didn't happen when he failed to pay Frank first month's rent of $800. But the generous Ralph took care of that. Ralph was initially shocked but,hey,no sacrifice was too great for friends like Jack,right? Ralph even came up the name for the restaurant(""How hard can it be to come up with a name for Jack's bistro?"". Janet,Terri and Larry came up with various names that Jack took into consideration. While the trio,Larry and Ralph were preparing for the grand opening,one problem arose:Larry,a used car salesman and also an expert in advertising,handed out hundreds of flyers advertising the bistro's opening with the wrong date! I think he did that intentionally for the sake of his visiting Greek family who were the bistro's first patrons. All that food Jack bought almost went to waste,but Larry's family ate it all! After dinner,there was Greek music and dancing. But,the dinner plates were shattered(the Greek show their appreciation by doing something like that). Maria,the engaged cousin of Jack's friend and former co-worker Felipe Gomez,stays with the trio for a few days. Maria's engagement to Manuel was broken and renewed. In one episode,Felipe helped out in the Jack's Bistro kitchen(the restaurant was formerly Charlie's Spot). Larry even briefly worked as a lounge singer,receiving applause from girls he dated,co-workers and softball teammates. In that episode,Ralph worked in the kitchen. Jack goes on a date with Larry's teenage sister Diane. Terri is on a dinner date at home with a paroled murderer. Terri almost married a soap opera actor named Brett Wade(Dennis Cole,ex-husband of Jaclyn Smith). Brett entered Terri's hospital Wilshire Memorial one day with a few broken ribs and she fell in love with him immediately. But,he only wanted to marry her for a contract renewal. Terri,while watching Brett's daytime serial(the fictitous) County Hospital(like the real ABC serial General Hospital),sees Brett shot to death by a jealous girlfriend. A married couple named Bob and Carol who live in the Santa Monica,CA complex also,have broken up because of a rumor about something that happened on their last vacation. There was no two-timing afterall and the couple made up. At the local pub,the Regal Beagle,Ralph sitting at the bar alongside a musclebound boxer named Biff Bower accidentally spills Biff's beer. Raplh offered to buy Biff another beer,but Jack,also sitting next to Ralph,""got a little hot"" with Biff,and Biff challenged Jack to a fight in the ring at Rocco's Gym where Biff works out. Jack thought that Janet was on a date with Ralph's visiting teenage nephew Marc. Jack saw them together while dining alone in a restaurant(not his,of course). While sporting a fake moustache,Jack suddenly won romantic affections from Terri! Jack got the idea from Larry who showed up at the Beagle with one. Jack also saves Arnie's Leather Shop from closing down(he bought a leather coat with $500 prize money). Angry Janet and Terri thought he bought the jacket with his restaurant rent money. On February 24,2006,81-year-old Don Knotts died of lung cancer. I dedicate this item to his memory and also of Ritter who died at age 54 of a heart ailment on September 11,2003. We'll be waiting for the eighth and final season now"
dvd,,4.0,SPERMS OF ENDEARMENT,"Originally a half-hour sitcom, POLICE SQUAD was hilarious and formed quite a good basis for the movies that followed.  If there's anyone to blame for this not being quite as good as its predecessors, it could be the director Peter Segal.  There are so many wonderful gags in this one, but Segal didn't capitalize on the sight gags that go on behind the scenes, except for a hilarious Jurassic park dinosaur behind one of the closed doors at the police station.  But Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley are so delightfully hammy and they carry the movie.  Fred Ward and Kathleen Freeman are quite good too as the bomber and his ma.  This movie has lots and lots of laughs and the climax at the Oscar awards is superb.  Watching OJ Simpson isn't as fun as it was before he received his notoriety in his wife's murder.  Another extremely good spoof is the opening rip off of THE UNTOUCHABLES.  It's great"
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,"Beautiful Production Values, Shallow Story (3.5 stars)","He Knew He Was Right based on the Anthony Trollope novel has many of the makings of a period drama success--beautiful sets and costumes, good actors, and a script written by the wonderful Andrew Davies, who also penned the BBC's miraculous 1996 miniseries Pride and Prejudice."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Eisenstein's Masterpiece,"This is the film that defined film grammar for decades to come. Also reinvented the editing process by the juxtaposition of images. Lets put it this way, unless your favorite film was made before 1925, without Bronenosets Potemkin it probably would not be around today period. No other film next to Citizen Kane have ever influenced the medium so greatly. In retrospect, viewing the film today might leave you wondering what all the fuss is about. Today much of the impact is lost due to our peace of time and development of technique. In fact many of the films scenes may seem, if nothing else, cheesy (the preacher waving his cross in all his stereotypical glory). But there are still just enough moments of sheer power (the Odessa steps, maggots in the meat) to lift it to a new level of intesity. "
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,A nice dark romantic comedy,This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.
dvd,25 of 28,5.0,Surreal!,In many publications this speech was named the number one speech of the 20th Century.  I will not disagree.  I have never been able to see the whole speech until now.  Dr. King's words ring true 37 years later.   Guaranteed to give you chillbumps!  A must for any collection
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,"Good, light workout",This is a terrific workout for those who are getting started and who may want a short workout to keep her metabolism going.  The workouts get the heart pumping without strain or shortness of breath. This DVD is wonderful.  Also it is terrific for walking indoors when walking outdoors isn't possible.  
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A New Favorite!,This movie is hilarious and family-friendly.  We all watch it over and over and laugh until we cry every time.  This is a new must-watch movie tradition during the holidays
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Looking forward to 2nd volume,"I don't think I find any matches against the Steiner Brothers. I also hope to get some of their early matches in the AWA. Some of the early matches included on this volume are not that ""extraordinary."" There are no matches against Sgt Slaughter, Crusher Blackwell, Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell, Steiner Brothers, Samoan Swat Team, Fantastics, Rick Rude & Manny Fernandez, Tower of Doom matches, etc. The match where they teamed with Sting and turned against him after the match would be essential. More matches from their numerous Japan tours would be great. I want to watch the match where they won the NWA International tag team championship in Japan and brought the belts back to the US. I had watched a few matches where a Power Warrior substituted for Animal and wrestled along side Hawk against the Steiners. There were also matches where Animal and Hawk wrestled against The Great Muta and Rick Steiner. I remember reading Japanese wrestling magazines showing the Road Warriors went fishing with the New Japan Pro Wrestling stars Muta, Chono, etc. with the Steiners. There was also a match where the RW teamed up with Hulk Hogan against Sting, Dr Death Steve Williams and Terry Gordy. Back in the US, there was a singles match where Ric Flair supposedly use a spike from Animal's shoulder pad on Animal's eye. I also want to see how the Powers of Pain hurt Animal's eye in a weight-lifting showdown(?) that resulted in surgery. There was a cage match where they were wrestling against the Samoan Swat Team (I think), and suddenly the Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) stormed in and put handcuff on Animal and threw Hawk into the cage bursting him open. If my memory was right, that led to an unlikely match later: RW + Midnight Express vs. SST + Freebirds. There was also a match against Dr Death Steve Williams and Mike Rotundo (or Terry Gordy) where Nikita Koloff was the guest referee. In a NWA studio taping, Ric Flair was wrestling in the ring, Hawk interfered and attacked Flair. When Animal tried to enter the ring, Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson hit him from behind. Then they piledrived him on the concrete floor outside the ring. After that, they ganged up on Hawk and both were left unconscious. I really missed those 80's matches where the Road Warriors slided into the ring and just kept pounding and throwing their opponents around. These were not in this volume. I would also like to see Sunny. Hopefully they will be included in an upcoming Road Warriors DVD."
dvd,,5.0,Shania's best DVD so far!!,"With a very similar set-up as Elvis' Comeback Special - small audience,"
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Elmo Fan!!!,Our daughter loves this...and so do Adults!!! Amazing the education they put in these video's for little ones.  We love Elmo; anything Elmo keeps our daughter entertained!!!
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Everyone should have a Ferris,My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.  This is a classic that every high school student should see.  It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,when too much was never enough,"The explosive creativity of the Sixties, favored by a booming economy, was nowhere stronger than in London. And London is the set of this fine movie, showing us Sixties-girl Julie Christie greedily using the great opportunities of her times."
dvd,,4.0,"""Dr. Pepper"" guy gets nipped","David (David Naughton ""Be a Pepper"") and Jack are Americans visiting England. Evidently they are not aware of the many werewolf movies. Everyone knows to beware of the moors. Not these two. Yep one gets bit the other ripped. Of course no one believes David when he mentions his hairy dreams and his suspicion that he may be experiencing that change in life. Long before the movie ""Six Sense"". David also saw dead people. "
dvd,,5.0,Better Than Citzen Kane,"Now considered the greatest American Film, yes, greater than Citizen Kane, The Searchers was always a John Wayne-John Ford favorite, but lately the critics have chimed in. Ford records once again and for all time his actors in the backdrop of an unreal place, Monument Valley. The jutting rocks placed before the camera as if an Ansel Adams photograph excites the eye.  There's much to be said for a good shoot site.  This one is the best of all time.  The framed shots from within The Edwards cabin, a photo of Wayne coming and going as the lonely American without connection to his family, a beautiful allegory in cinema."
dvd,,4.0,Jack at his best as usual,Kiefer Sutherland does his usually excellent job and Michael Douglas was also very good. 
dvd,,4.0,A Great Book Made Into a Very Good Film,"When I first heard they were going to turn the Da Vinci Code into a motion picture I was disappointed.  It would made a much better mini-series, and I still believe that; however, hats off to Ron Howard (director) and Akiva Goldsman (writer) for making a film that captures the true essence of the novel.  What they chose to leave out works and the main storyline remains untouched from the novel.  I also wasn't thrilled when I heard Tom Hanks had been cast in the lead role of Robert Langdon, and while his performance was good I still think he was too old for the role.  A man in his middle to late thirties would have been a better choice than the aging, pudgy Hanks.  Regardless of this small gripe The Da Vinci Code, as a movie, was very good.  Even though I've read the novel upon which it is based twice, I still found myself on the edge of my seat as I watched the film.  if you liked the novel, you will like the movie"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great work out to getting started! not for advanced though..,I love this work out!!! The routine only takes a few times to catch on in the cardio A & B so don't worry about getting discouraged like other routines when you are falling over your own feet trying to keep up. I have lost weight utilizing the cardio and mixing and matching the other targeted areas.  I have been using this DVD for 1 month now and highly recommend it. 
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Kipling's Mongoose Comes to DVD,"My CBS-recorded copy was full of drop-outs, so I was delighted to find out this great Chuck Jones adaptation of the Kipling Jungle Book tale was finally on DVD. Although the story is animated in the usual Jones style, it has been done more in an effort to look like book illustrations. Although the mongoose is cute--much more adorable than the real thing--parents should be warned that all these Jungle Book stories have been taken word-for-word from the actual book and not from the cutesy-poo Disney flick, so the cold-and-sinister cobras and other snakes hissing about death may be frightening for very young children."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Can't lose with Warren Miller,"You can not lose with a Warren Miller movie. He has come out with another masterpiece. I saw this year's movie in one of its showings in Seattle and it rocked. These movies seem like they get better every year. It has the  steeps, cool new tricks and a trip to  my local hill Crystal Mountain.  Everyone, the powder sucks there so just don't go and leave it all to me.  Anyway, Warren Miller scores again with another of his amazing movies"
dvd,,5.0,perfect,perfect timing no complaints at all!!
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,The most Popular Season,"This was the season when the A-Team was the highest rated television. This comedic series had an eclectic group of actors with George Peppard, Mr. T, Dwight Shultz, and Dirk Benedict who with their everyman type of fighting and propensity to create tanks out of gardening supplies provided a fun hour of television.  This season had a few turkey episodes but overall it was entertaining with several excellent episodes, some of which were penned by the excellent writing talents of Stephen J. Cannell. The Big Squeeze, and Incident at Crystal Late stood out as some of the best the episode in the series and even the ones that were a little clich such as Bullets and Bikinis, and Timber you got the idea the actors where having a little fun.  This season was before the Cosby show made them make some serious changes in order to try to stay alive, and the formula was in full force.  So if you like to watch elaborate con jobs or even the worst (or best shots) in the cinema pick up this season"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,The simple life 3 - The interns,I thought simple life 3 was pretty good.  That is if you like Paris Hilton and Nichole Richie *Which i do*  Otherwise i'm sure you would be utterly bored.  It was fun to watch the girls get into trouble and then trying to find ways to get out of it.  All in all i enjoyed watching the third season of Simple Life
dvd,17 of 18,5.0,Not a typical AA meeting...,"but a fantastic glimpse into the curse of alcoholism. Richard Lewis captured for me in this movie the agony of alcoholism more accurately than anyone in any other movies I've seen. For those that complain that this movie doesn't do justice to what a typical AA meeting is like, I agree... but I think they're missing the point. "
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Funny stuff.,"This is a really great and hilarious movie. If you're a Christopher Guest fan, and you like ""Spinal Tap"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", you'll love this one as well.  It's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies, like Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, and they're all always great together.  Also, David Cross is hilarious as the UFO nut."
dvd,,5.0,"Wonderful, heartfelt movie about life and love","I finished watching this movie last night and I have to say it is an absolutely lovely film. The story line may have been attempted by other film makers...but Run the Wild Fields really is a winner. Exceptional portrayals by Joanne Walley, Sean Patrick Flanery and Alexa Vega."
dvd,0 of 6,1.0,"No, No, No!","This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Young Evan Rachel Wood is Hollywood's best young actress,"If you have not seen this series, I strongly urge you to give it a try.  Young Evan Rachel Wood is simply the best teenage actress in all of Hollywood!  My heart just ached for her, as her character dealt with the problems of her parents being divorced.  Evan, you are the best"
dvd,,5.0,The 4400 - The Complete First Season,"This is such a great show!  I sent this to my son, who is serving in Iraq.  Sending seasons of television shows is a great gift to the soldiers serving overseas.  Even though it's TV they feel connected to ""the world"" by being able to watch what we are watching.  My son loved this show as well as many others I have sent him.  The soldiers share with all thier buddies"
dvd,,4.0,Denise does good again!,This DVD is great in that it has lots of exercises tailored to

dvd,2 of 6,5.0,great,"I dont have time for this but real quick, it is an awsum dvd if you are into drums. Neil is the best. And a good little biography"
dvd,6 of 10,5.0,A community forces open a paedophile family's pandora's box,"I'll be as upfront as this documentary filmmaker was in his story telling: I'm a survivor of eleven years of sexual abuse at the hands of my father. My 3 siblings also were abused as were other children. How do I know? Besides them telling me, I often witnessed the incidents. Not all serio-peodophiles are the stuff of witch-hunt hysteria, but trust me they'd sure like you to believe that was the case."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Joe Dirt - a laughfest,"This movie is absoulutely funny.  It makes you laugh all the way through.  The cast couldn't have been picked better and the storyline is original.  It's jokes about his hair and T-shirts are worth the watching all by themselves.  The charecters are so hilarious because of their speech and mannerisms.  For a good laugh, this is the one to watch over and over"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The best baby video out there!,"This is another winner for the baby faith team.  My child interacts with the cute and funny puppets shows and dances to the music.  I find myself humming the tunes throughout the day too.  The best was when the narrator (Jodi Benson of Disney's Little Mermaid fame) says ""God Loves You"" and my two year old turned around, gave me a big hug and said, ""God Loves me and God Loves You too!""  Talk about bringing tears to my eyes!  These products are great!!"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,A cinematic spectacle of surrealism and reality.,This review is for the 2001 Criterion DVD.
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A Noble Era in American Filmmaking,"There's nothing like revisiting a movie from your childhood (1953) & experiencing it 50 years later. Such was my re-entry back to this Western classic, a morality tale of Shane, a gunslinger-with-a-past who captivates all who meet him. Alan Ladd, in mid-career, plays the lead, opposite the charming, breathy-voiced Jean Arthur, who, in real life, was a late-blooming Hollywood actress, age 52 to Ladd's 40. Her devoted marriage in the film to the commanding homesteader Van Heflin is deepened by the obvious platonic attraction she and Ladd share, as does Jean Arthur's son, the young Brandon de Wilde, surely one of the screen's best child actors. De Wilde's open face & saucer-like blue eyes act as an exclamation point for Alan Ladd's unflagging character & integrity."
dvd,0 of 6,5.0,The Muppet Movie - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition,"the muppets rule, no questions asked this is a very very awesome exciting lovely movie"
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,The opprobrious blindness!,"Around a brutal and mysterious murder of a soldier, a young attorney will be sent to investigate this dark and bitter incident. A curious honor code seems to exist hovering the subordinates who will try to cover up all the clues with the only intention to preserve the moral and good costumes."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"Excellent, but way too much was changed ","Well i just finished the book Christine last week.  I was determined to find the movie.  After searching for the last week, i finally bout it.  I had seen it a few years ago when i was 10 or 11.  Somehow i remember it being much better.  But nonetheless, it was great.  I do have a few problems though. Generally i dont mind things being rearranged or changed, but they cut out wayyy too much, and completly changed the ending.  They practically swtiched Roland LeBays role and George Lebays role, but only partically, i was quite confused when i got to that scene.  They also completely cut out the Lebay possession sub-plot, thus changing Arnies character.  I was dissapointed in Micheal cunninghams role in this movie, first off, he didnt look like a thing like i pictured him, and his whole sub-plot with Arnie and Dennis was completely cut, and he only have about 10 lines in the entire movie. The biggest dissapointment for me had to be the cutting of the Dennis/Leigh subplot.  THe ending was changed totally, also a disappointment."
dvd,3 of 5,4.0,"5 for the movie, about hm, 2 for the DVD?","If you're a fan of buying DVD's, you know of the much-maligned ""double dips"". To put it simply, it's where the studios re-release a film with more features/enhancements than the previous release had. While early Disney films warranted double dips since restoration and a better understanding of DVD's allowed them to get the best transfers as well as lots of extras. It's when they're really recent films we tend to get a little mad and mad we were with the Tarzan SE. Originally it was like the Collector's Edition with extra bonus features including others but at the last minute, there goes the 2nd disc. It's really too bad since that most likely is the disc they'll keep making rather than the superior CE."
dvd,4 of 7,5.0,Adam Sandler's Best Movie!,"This one is on my top ten list. It has the funniest story line ever! A man gets on the wrong cruise! HAHAHAHAHAHHAHHA! If you do not like this movie you must be a robot. Or Dead. I loved the part where he loses his hat in the water! Who thinks up this stuff?! I laughed so hard, I accidentally swallowed my head! This movie is funnier with no sound and picture! WHOO WEE AHHH YES!"

dvd,,4.0,perfect for starting out...,"i just bought this tape two days ago and my 2 year old loves it.  she has asked for it these two days in a row.  we started doing yoga recently with a class, however it isn't always that convenient to get to so i wanted to try a dvd.  since she is young it was really hard to pick.  but i am very glad i purchased this one."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Reluctant heroes trying to find a way home...,"Musa is about a band of koreans on a diplomatic mission in China that goes array. After being exiled into the desert they run into a captured princess. She promises them a boat if they deliver her home, and the koreans reason if they save her they can return to their own home victorious. There are several complex emotions that come into play. The Korean leader is full of self doubt and is also competing for the attention of the princess against a slave. The Koreans are resentful of said princess, blaming all of their woes on her. The princess herself is determined to maintain status and composure, however the deaths of her people and the Koreans began to take its toll. Musa is a grand epic, based on the simple desire to see one's home again. The battle scenes are well shot, and action does not let up. The final battle is especially good, focusing on the sacrifices and the bonds that the Koreans have made with the Hans. Musa means warrior, and the movie does not focus so much on just one, but all of them. When the inevitable happens it is enough to bring tears to even the most hardened eyes."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,shane,"Shane is a classic. What more is there to say? If you haven't seen Jack Palance walk down Elisha Cooke, you don't know movies"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great New Soundtrack...,"The musical score in the original version underlined the melodrama in an almost 1950's way.  The new version is not only more true to S.E. Hinton's novel but the soundtrack is much more appropos, in time with the early/mid 1960's backdrop of the story.  You can't get more timeless than bluesy surf garage rock mixed with Sun era/early RCA Elvis. The new sounds juxtaposed against the original 'Stay Gold' theme provide a relief which further accentuates the beauty of the original composition."
dvd,,5.0,Awesome!,"My kids keep asking to watch these episodes over and over.  Brings back great memories and the quality of the DVD's is outstanding.  I thought the kids would not like the black and white, but it doesn't seem to bother them.  This purchase was worth the money spent"
dvd,9 of 14,1.0,We Were Robbed!,"We bought ""the series.""  What we got was Season 2 complete (unless any were originally 2 hours in length); the pilot tv movie McCLOUD: WHO KILLED MISS U.S.A.? bearing the syndication title PORTRAIT OF A DEAD GIRL; and three 90-minute ""movies"" each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random, unrelated one-hour episodes of the show's first season - which ran under the umbrella title, 4 IN 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix!  For those studio executives who don't understand the concept, nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing...the way it was...not frankensteined into phony movies.  If Universal had any integrity at all, they'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited, original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes...with the 4 IN 1 umbrella sequence...and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1, season 1.  I supposed next we'll have to beware of COLUMBO and other MYSTERY MOVIE 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform (and yet being sold as ""The Complete Season!"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Not a particularly comfortable film,"I enjoyed the many twists of speech in this movie, though I found the movie itself vulgar. I reminded myself a few times that this was part of the point that the movie sought to communicate about the Earl, so was pacified."
dvd,17 of 17,5.0,Documentary of the Year,"The Columbian Exposition was vast in every way - from the sheer size of its physical location to the number of its visitors to the diversity of its exhibits - yet this film covers it all using a historically responsible and entertaining approach. ""EXPO"" treats its viewers to a detailed ""behind-the-scenes"" look into the Exposition with Gene Wilder as a guide. The tour is chock-full of fascinating tidbits, and the period photographs add a whole other dimension that is often absent from texts on the subject. The film truly drops the viewer smack in the middle of the Fair. The quality of the high-definition transfer is stunning, and the picture looks as clear and crisp as a high-definition broadcast. The sound is enveloping and adds depth to the documentary; you actually feel as if you're surrounded by the Fair's bustling crowds. The film is without a doubt satisfying for everyone from the amateur history buff to the well-read historian"
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,"Poignant meditation on sex, love, and madness.","I saw this film when it first came out in 1963 - I was 19 years old and very impressionable.  I don't remember any scandal about it at the time, and it wasn't a popular film, was shown only at college art film houses.  The vaguely homoerotic aspect of the film was a bit troubling, more so than the menage a trois, but Jeanne Moreau was so obviously a beautiful and sexually desirable woman that she neutralized that aspect of the story.  The ending was shocking, made more so by the contrast with the enchanting Moreau singing ""Le Tourbillon de la Vie"".  (She has several CD's listed on Amazon on which this song appears.  Also, the written lyrics [in french] are available at www.paroles.net/chansons/30790.htm.  The english translation in the subtitles is pretty lame.)"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Great, fun and entertaining, I'd give it a one hunderd out of 5!","This is a very great movie,  If only this thing would go that far! The Jones movie's are my favoite movies of all time!!!! Any body needs to see the movies, and it's awesome that they are selling them indivisual. There like page tuners, you can't but the book down. Well with these movies its the same, you Just can't stop watching them... everybody can enjoy the movie's. You probably wouldn't let your kids watch the jones for a while becuase of there violence and gore. But actually, I saw them when I was a 7 year old boy. And you know what, I loved them! Personaly my favorite is the last one. "
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,THE GREATNESS OF BATMAN CONTINUES,"I will go ahead and try to break down each disc's REALLY memorable moments. Every episode certainly has something you remember, say a great score to that show, or exta great voice acting by batman or a guest star, or maybe it was that one storyline you remember where you seriously thought that it was a thriller, but I will try to point out some of the little things that this show did.  Of course I was like 9-10 years old when this show started, but it is odd how the show has gotten better after not having watched it for around 12 years.  "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Best Hilarious movie ever,"Don't be fooled with the negative reviews by critics or low scores by some movie review sites. .If you are not the type of  viewer expecting  some serious message or plot from a movie,  watch just for pure entertainment then this is one of the best hilarious movie ever.Just relax and watch this movie. This is the first movie of Chris Farley I saw (on a tv channel in 2002) and instantly it made me his big big fan. I laughed and laughed and laughed through every singe moment of the movie.This is the one of the best spoof movies besides the light of naked gun series. Chris farley is the best in this kind of geners. Once you watch his devotion in the film and his funny facial expressions, body language ,you will surely consider other latest so called comedy stars and their movies so boring . I am from Bangladesh (Asia) and I don't know what people of  USA and other countries think about this guy but he will always remain "
dvd,2 of 4,4.0,Surprisingly very good. ,"Sean Penn keeps popping up everywhere I turn. He's like an infectious disease that won't stop. He wasn't in his place in The Interpreter, but here, in a bit role in The Weight of Water, he's right at home. Catherine McCormack does another good job (did I mention that it helps that she's amazingly hot?), and Elizabeth Hurley is oh so hot. I can't believe they put both of those women in the same film. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"Yes, it's THAT funny!","This is one of the funniest shows on the planet! I used to watch the AbFab reruns on Comedy Central years ago which is how I even became a fan of the show. Word to the wise: this is not a sweet,delicate show. It's loud and rowdy and alot of fun (if that's your speed!). I love it because the characters and the situations are realistic and the reactions are so funny- I watch this show rooting for the totally smoked out but genuine Edina and Patsy and I wouldn't change anything. If you've never seen the show, try to see it at least once before you buy it so you know what you're getting- if you don't laugh, consider going to the doctor to get your sense of humor fixed- otherwise, go out and buy at least the first 3 seasons. You won't regret it"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Wonderful Memories,I fell in love with this movie when I was a little girl and was thrilled to find it on DVD.  A must for anyone wanting to re-live wonderful childhood memories.  Puts the new Dr. Dolittle to shame
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Nearly Perfect Political Satire,"This 90-minute satire on politics in the age of mass media zips along for 75 minutes at a breakneck pace, sharp and witty and full of great performances, especially Hoffman as a film producer underappreciated by everyone but himself and Willie Nelson as a slightly muddled country singer. The commentary on war as an Administration tool for distraction has become even more meaningful since the film was made in '97. Though it gets a little off the rails in the last 15 minutes, ""Wag the Dog"" is great fun, and it's starting to look like it'll be Levinson's last great film. My favorite lines --"
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,"No major story line, but this is fun and hot ;-)",Salsa is a brilliant movie - one of the best movies with no major plot.  There is fantastic music and great dancing and a hot guy - what more could you want.
dvd,0 of 3,1.0,I Expected Better,"I'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about Christianity.  By now, thanks to this film and the book of the same title, most individuals interested in Christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus.  That being said, I will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film, and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,My favorite swashbuckling film...,"The Sea Hawk is the one film that I saw as a kid and could not stop watching from start to finish. With breathtaking action, great acting, and a plot line that takes you all over the world [from England to South America and back] The Sea Hawk is one movie that you should see if you want to know what a real pirate movie is all about."
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Another one the trailer goofed up!,ok.. I absolutely loved this movie but went expecting vampires..
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,Pop Lock and Break,So glad I ordered early!! My tape just arrived and I can't believe it.  I've already owned the first dvd and this isn't even comparable.  This dvd has much more instruction and goes form the lowest levels for litte children up to breakin and advanced steps.  The crew is much better and this was clearly directed for learning as well as a fun watch. It's worth every penny!!!

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Lots of monster fun!,"I've bought quite a few used videos lately, as the selection is better than what the stores are carrying lately for Sesame Street.  This video is a riot and my daughter begs for it almost daily.  Set-up like an awards show, the songs ""Fur"" and ""Fuzzy and Blue"" are fun and entertaining even for adults.  I like this video because it includes the character Frazzle, who was dropped because he was deemed ""too scary"" to kids.  My 2 year old LOVES Frazzle and begs for his song over and over.  How's that for scary?  This video is cute and the songs are fun.  From the songs mentioned above to ""C is for Cookie"" this video contains lots of monster fun"

To make matters worse, his roommate (Mike White) is being hounded by his girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) to get Dewey to cough up the rent money he owes. What's a guy to do? In this case, Dewey pretends to be his roommate to make some extra bucks substitute-teaching. Over the course of several weeks, he takes a class of private-school students and molds them into a rockin' band."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Road Trip to an Unexpected Place,"The premise is outrageously sentimental; however, Charlotte Rampling, with her trademark dry delivery, has never uttered a sentimental word onscreen in her life.  In this movie, as ""Helen,""she's supposedly in an Aberdeen hospital, near death with cancer.  She calls her daughter ""Kaisa,"" a successful, feisty(as they so often say), London lawyer with sidelines in snorting coke and one-night stands with strangers, and asks her to go find Helen's husband (common-law or otherwise, we never know), and Kaisa's father, Tomas Heller, as played by Stellan Skarsgard: he's previously worked the North Sea oil rigs, but is now back in his Norwegian homeland."

dvd,2 of 5,5.0,Finally Accidents Will Happen,"I LOVE Degrassi but I can't help to feel a bit strange about the two missing episodes.  It sort of feels like the male producers decideded it would be cool to see all of the young actresses in leotards, matronly leotards at that.  I felt it was iky!!! All of the actresses are beautiful with beautiful bodies but I don't understand the point of having a gymastics team materialize out of the blue.  The obvious cuts between real gymnists and the actresses was just plain cheesy!!!  I guess I was expecting more out of the two missing episodes.  I have a new low found respect for Ashley because of the way she announced to the entire school cafeteria the pregnancy of Many & Craig.  I also felt that there may have been some doubt as to who the father is because Manny was chummy with Sulley also remember...."
dvd,,5.0,Six Stars,"This movie is a perfect example of how films ought to be done.  A good script, a sensible plot, and flawless casting make this film a surprising classic.  Even the subplots were gems--although you see Captain Havlock (Bernard Fox) for three scenes, he is a lively supporting character with his own soul and story."

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,great workout,"This is a great DVD.  The workouts are fun and the instructor is easy to follow.  The DVD consists of 5 workouts with various themes-a warmup, kickboxing, bootcamp-style, one with lots of jumping and legwork, and a toning/weights section at the end.  I do all 5 which is a really good workout-about the energy equivailent of running for 20 min.  Just one of the five workouts is not enough for me but would be perfect for someone who is just starting out.  I have about 4 cardio tapes and this one is the best by far.   "

There's a countdown clock for each workout. During each workout, Kathy has you switch exercises every 45 seconds, which I think is great. No annoying rep-counting, and you can focus on working it hard and getting the burn because you know it will be over soon!"

Your kids can even watch this and you don't have to worry about what they are seeing or hearing.  In short... GREAT"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"As Godard said, this film is ""the world in an hour and a half""....","I have been a Bresson admirer for many years.  I remember I saw this film at a Bresson retrospective sponsored by the Cinematheque Ontario.  The film was not on video at the time, so I desperately wanted to see it.  The film is so amazing, so poignant, and so deeply spiritual that no one could come away from it unmoved (unless they are completely heartless).  Instead of recapping the entire film, I'll just talk about the opening scene when Balthazaar is a child.  The 2 children who keep him as their pet baptize him.  I did the same to my 2 cats after seeing this film; that's how moved I was by it.  I remember telling friends about the ""plot"" of this, and, naturally, they laughed (haha, it's a film about a donkey.  Like Shrek, right?).  I ignored them, and saw one of the greatest films ever made.  Bresson is a master filmmaker, and this film is reminiscent of Tarkovsky and Dreyer, among others.  Bresson never belonged to any film movements (even though the French New Wave was happening around this time).  He is his own artist.  His films can be broken down into 2 categories:  masterpieces, and near masterpieces.  How many filmmakers can you really say that about?  Do yourself a favour and see arguably his greatest film...

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"Vicious, delicious, and perfect","The script, plot, performances and direction of this play would be impossible to improve on. Although Alec Guinness is constantly cited for his multiple roles, the star of the piece is undoubtedly Dennis Price, who is incomparable and impeccable in this Wildean incarnation. Few, if any, reviews seem to credit Robert Hamer and John Dighton for their utterly brilliant script and dialogue, said to be based on a novel by Roy Horniman. Perhaps I should have heard of him. There is a deep, dark and acid undercurrent of vitriolic censure of the hypocrisies of the English class system. The setting is Edwardian -- not Victorian -- England, ie some time between 1902 and 1910: the manners and mores, dress and conventions of the age will shortly be swept away by World War I. The references to women's suffrage are entirely to the point. Mr Mazzini elicits sympathy for his evil career because he, or rather his mother, has been treated so callously by the prevailing social code. Price's most passionate moments are when he remembers his mother. In fact, these are the only moments he shows any feeling at all.  There is a fleeting comment on the furnishings of the castle: the D'Ascoyne family rose to power by methods little different from those employed by the successful 10th Duke. Hence the collection of murderous weaponry, stretching back over centuries. Violence begets violence, and blood runs thicker than water. Who can tell whether the reprieved killer did not manage to retrieve his memoirs before any damage was done, and go on to eliminate the wicked little Sibella? Marriage to Edith might prove punishment enough. A consummate salad, cold but delectable.    "
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,The Beginning of a Cultural Phenomenon,"Take 16 castaways, maroon them on a deserted island in the middle of the South China Sea for 39 days, and watch as they try to outwit, outlast, and outplay each other for the title of Sole Survivor and a $1 million prize. Simple concept, huge result. This is the first season of the #1 reality show of all time, Survivor. This first crop of 16 hopefuls provided for the blockbuster of the summer of 2000. I did not get to see this when it was originally airing on television, but I bought the DVD when it first came out to finally see how this show I had come to love all began. I was not disappointed. While the first season obviously has some technical errors and editing differences, those are easily excusable because, after all, this was the first time. The players were not as savvy (the verb ""Pagonging"" came out of this show, but the members of the Pagong tribe practically Pagonged themselves), with the exception of the original alliance of Richard, Sue, Kelly, and Rudy. This season also had four to eventually compete in All-Stars, Richard, Sue, Rudy, and Jenna Lewis. "

dvd,0 of 2,4.0,"Funny, but flawed.",I liked this movie and I don't care who knows it.  The thing that ruined it was why is there only one women in this film?

The rest of  the movie was funny and strange. Tim curry is so annoying though

dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Unique and Effective!,"This new DVD from The FIRM is split into three abdominal workouts. And they aren't the same old stuff. The moves get more intense with each workout and feature a blend of some pilates and yoga strengthening. If you're really tired of plain old crunches, try this workout- you won't be sorry. It will challenge you, and the music is quite entertaining- it just ""fits"" with the moves. You may want to get the Sculpting Stick to use with this one. It's a very good body bar and it's fun to use. It makes the workouts more effective (sometimes you place the stick under your knees or use the ""twigs"" to intensify crunches).Kitk"

dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Some part of the film might seem like fillers but it gives great intensity.,"A good number of viewers believe that ""The Deer Hunter"" is overlong and a bit overrated, probably due to a handful of scenes, but beside that its an important film that was the first commentary on the topic of Vietnam. It wouldn't have worked nearly as powerfully if the first hour been trimmed down a bit. It wasn't the director's attention because he meant to focus on ""character development,"" base on the lives of three all-American friends, Niko (Christopher Walken), Michael (Robert DeNiro) and Steven (John Savage) through the affects of the war.

My one problem is that I cannot, on any of the three discs watched so far (including one replacement from the manufacturer), cannot make the volume play Japanese spoken language and English subtitles, a scheme which I prefer for anime and which I can make work on any of the other seven multi-disk series, plus numerous individual DVDs that I own"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The camera does not lie...,"This documentary film is absolutely excellent. It rivals Errol Morris' ""The Thin Blue Line"" as one of the best studies of the American justice system ever made. From the opening moments of the film (actually 8 episode, each approximately 45 minutes), one is immersed in the tale of a woman's (Kathleen Peterson) gruesome death. Her husband, Michael Peterson, is accused of her murder and he becomes the rightful centerpiece of a very strange and twisted story. This movie is not for the timid, since the crime scene and autopsy are examined in detail. However, the criminal forensics are both necessary and fascinating. This is not a neat and tidy CSI episode. The power of this film resides in its ability to expose the true character of the participants, whether it is the defendant Michael Peterson, his lawyers or the prosecutors. The Staircase, like the photographs of Kathleen Peterson's brutal death, is a starkly revealing documentary portrait with a soothing soundtrack. Buy it and watch it even if you think you recall something about this well known trial. You will not be disappointed"

dvd,21 of 22,5.0,THE BEST CIVIL WAR MOVIES EVER MADE!,"Based on the bestselling novels by Michael and Jeff Shaara, ""Gods and Generals"" and ""Gettysburg"" (based on the elder Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"") are the most excting and emotional Civil War epics ever filmed. The battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic Civil War battle sequences ever put on screen. The acting is phenomenal, with the likes of Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Tom Berenger, Robert Duvall, Bruce Boxleitner, Martin Sheen, Richard Jordan, Sam Elliott and Mira Sorvino, but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies. Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films, giving rise to the hope that the last film, ""The Last Full Measure,"" will complete what will hopefully be the best Civil War trilogy ever made!"
dvd,8 of 9,4.0,"Enjoyable, but...","Like others who have reviewed this DVD I have read all of Ian Rankin's work, and enjoyed them mightily.  Rebus is one of my favorite crime/mystery creations, right up there with Andy Dalziel, Miss Marple and Thomas Lynley, so when I saw a video version was finally available in the States I was ecstatic."
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,Not for beginners,"My criticisms are there are form corrections missing in some exercises and there is really no proper breathing instruction. Their outfits are dated (which is amusing) but the exercises are very challenging and some of the moves were awkward for me and could be really dangerous to a ""nubie"". I didn't really groove on the warm-up portion at all - it was okay. However, I thought the upper body work-out was effective and I thought her cool downs and stretching portions were great. Again, not for the uninitiated - should you buy this DVD I would recommend doing a run through with no weights (or if you must use 1-3 lb wrist weights) so you can concentrate on getting the moves/form correct. There are no fancy foot moves which I like. I've done many home video workouts and this one was really long and super tough. I'm really traditional so I will stick to my Tammy & Minna videos.  Note: the DVD is set up so you can break the workout into segments"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Gripping movie,"Verhoeven's last Dutch movie was made out of spite. Increasingly lambasted for his films in his native Holland for being too perverted and desperate to make the move to Hollywood, this was the movie he made to show off potential executives in the USA. There were movie offers that he was interested in, in America, but due to one reason or another, he ended up frustrated with the whole process of waiting."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"wonderful, wonderful story!!! ","Do you love historical romances?  Do you want to watch a movie full of beautiful costumes, set in Venice, with a wonderful cast and even more wonderful dialogue?  This is your movie.  I can't believe I didn't know about this movie sooner!  Catherine McCormack is Outstanding!  ***NOTE: Don't read on if you are easily distracted!***The only thing that slightly detracted from this movie was the fact that Rufus Sewell has an eye that doesn't quite match his other.  When the camera hits his face head on, it is hard to miss and once I noticed it, it became distracting.  But hey, you can't complain about something the guy can't help.  He did a great job with his role and has been great in the other movies I've caught him in (Tristan and Isolde)"

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,An Early Comedy From The Coen Brothers!,"With so many wonderful reviews here on amazon, I will make this one brief. When I first watched this film [In Mesa, Arizona visting my sister] I really didn't think it was that funny. Fast forward a few years, and I found the film funny. Go figure? The film has been discussed here at length, so I will just give you my perspective on the film. One of the things I liked about this film by the Coen Brothers was the acting of Nicholas Cage. For some reason, he was funny. From his funny looks, to the nuances that he gave, it is hard to remember that there was a time when Nicholas Cage was REALLY funny. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Showgirl Shines,"I've seen 4 Kylie Shows.  This one makes the other 3 seem like nap time.  This show is the best tour I have ever seen.  It's flashy, but in an effortless way.  Almost like this tour was more about ideas based on what Kylie wants more than what the audience would want.  She starts out with a Moulin Rouge theme that is super flashy and glamorous.  Next was the Disco Dive section.  After that she has a Homo erotic men-together-in-the-locker-room theme that is perfect for preserving her gay appeal, (not to mention that the dancers are almost naked).  She also has some Chicago influence and then comes the Space Age Kylie.  Her singing is stronger than any of the actual tracks she has recorded.  Then there is the set itself, it's amazing.  There are many beautiful colors and pieces that go every which way.  It is very nice.  I would pick up this DVD as soon as you can"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Charlie delivers in full HD glory,"This movie looks simply amazing! The color, texture and detail provided by HD-DVD are superb, this is a showcase title for the format. First a word about my setup, which is nice but far from optimal. The HD-DVD player is connected via HDMI to a Sanyo PL-Z4 projector, with an approximately 140"" picture thrown onto a light beige wall. The room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades. Hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado's but my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Somebody shot the mayor, but they did not shoot the deputy. ","Without a shadow of a doubt, hands-down, Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary.  No other filmmaker can come close to the brilliance that Guest and his repertory ensemble of actors produce when they all come together to form a movie.  A MIGHTY WIND is another of Guest and Co.'s projects that examines the inner workings of the folk music business.  In the movie, folk music icon Irving Steinbloom (Stuart Luce) passes away and his son, Jonathan (Bob Balaban) decides to put together a memorial concert featuring Steinbloom's favorite and best-selling musicians.  There's the classic three-men group The Folksmen (parody of the real The Kingston Trio), the obsessively brightly colored co-ed ensemble The Main Street Singers, and the sweet and lovable duo Mitch and Mickey.  The three groups gather together for one night in New York City's Town Hall singing the music that they love."

He begins to hang out more and more with Shoko, a wanna-be pop idol, who actually might have the talent to make the bigtime. Even though she seems like a tough girl, Kyoichi finds out that maybe her confidence isn't as great as what she projects outwardly. The two slowly find themselves slipping into a kind of relationship, but will it last? Next, Makoto supposedly finds his soulmate by using a computer software program and gets the girl's friend, the bespectacled cosplayer Yumi, to introduce him to the girl, named Erika. When it goes badly, Yumi sets out Pygmalion style to educate Makoto on how to act and talk around Erika to make a good impression. But is Yumi really spending time with Makoto to educate him, or because SHE likes him? Things get a tad boy-lovish in the last episode as Kyoichi has a dogging loneliness that is keeping him awake at night and he cannot for the life of him figure why he is feeling so alone. Could it be the loss of Chiharu, or is it something more cosmic? He meets a handsome pretty boy named Takaya at the videostore where he works part-time and bonds with the guy because he too feels like something or someone is missing from his life. Even though Takaya is really handsome, he is trying to work up the courage to ask a classmate to go out with him. Even though Kyoichi is kinda lost at the moment, maybe he can find his way by encouraging Takaya. "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,This Movie Rocks!!! (And I Would Like A Date With Ms. Alonso!!!),"This movie is a rarity as a sequel because in my opinion it surpasses it's predecessor. Danny Glover plays ""Action Man Super Cop"" who is on the hunt for someone or something who is killing all of the Drug Lords in 1997 L.A. I haven't as yet figured out why this is a bad thing but Hey what do I know? This movie is redeemed and enhanced  by the presence of the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso who has a very unique way of introducing herself to her new partner.!!!

""Oh great, they are making a cute movie out of a horrible problem called addiction, and are going to sum up rehab in a darling, romanticized way.""  I refused to watch it for a long time because of this presumption.  Relax, and give the film a try.  Although cute in places and using some subtle but great humor, '28 Days' does not romanticize the problem of addiction."

The two are married and Louis takes his bride, as well as her sister Nora, back to his home in England. A few years pass in which the young couple have a son and their happiness as a family seems well assured. That happiness proves to be short lived, however, when Emily begins receiving regular visits from Colonel Osbourne, a close friend of her father. Even though he is a highly respected member of Parliament, Colonel Osbourne has the reputation of being a ladies man and Louis becomes uncomfortable with his frequent visits to Emily. Louis confronts Emily with his fears and suspicions and asks her to stop receiving the Colonel. Emily is shocked and hurt that Louis does not trust her. The issue becomes a bone of contention between the couple   and they begin to quarrel and eventually separate over the matter. As the story progresses, Louis's unfounded jealously will slowly begin to poison him and to destroy his once happy marriage."
dvd,7 of 8,4.0,Keith Urban videos,"What more do you need to know? He's a fantastic musician, he's easy on the eyes, and you can see how his style and direction has matured through the chronology of these videos. The disc itself is pretty bare bones, so be aware of that. I was disappointed that his newer videos weren't on this disc, but that just means that there should be another one coming out sometime soon. "
dvd,6 of 53,1.0,Fabricating History. ,"Few leftist icons are looked upon more favorably than professor and activist Howard Zinn. Like many radical ideologues, he is the darling of students, the professorate, and the glitterati. Indeed, Hollywood star Matt Damon provided the narration for a hagiographic documentary about his life entitled, Howard Zinn -You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train."
dvd,,4.0,"Ah, Romance!","My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of ""healthy"" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story."
dvd,2 of 11,5.0,Best Movie Ever,"With Beutiful lines including the ever famous ""what do u do around here for fun?"" ""i run around with rita"" how could u resist!?! it's a movie about Sabrina's lust for mort and her utter need to destory his and rita's life after a burtal rejection"
dvd,,5.0,My 3 year old loves it!,"She watches this show as much as possible!  Wenlock was a little scary the first time.  But every viewing thereafter has been okay for her.  Shiver offers great comic relief and is adorable.  The DVD comes with four 3D glasses and is only for certain scenes of the movie.  My daughter likes the movie so much that she has asked for a ""Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus"" birthday party for her 4th birthday! "

dvd,,4.0,Not nearly as bad as critics make it out to be...,3.5 Stars
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Western,"My second favourite John Wayne Movie, the first being ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"".  A great cast and very entertaining as the westerns from this era are far superior to those of today.  The movie shows just because you are superior in rank doesn't mean you know everything.  The battle of wills between two of the greats John Wayne and Henry Fonda was handled beautifully by these two veteran actors.  Throw in a great supporting cast of Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Shirley Temple, John Agar and you can't miss.  I highly recommend this movie to add to your collection.  Glad to see it finally came out on DVD. "
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,The Pool is Deep,"Incredible weaving of four stories that all tie together. Gaghan brilliantly executed the telling of a deep story with masterey. The cinematography, score, storyline, and characters are well-thought out and well chosen. It's a deep pool that requires close attention. I've seen it four times and just now feel as if I'm truly beginning to understand all of it. Can't wait for the next Gaghan film"

dvd,4 of 5,5.0,When Love Withers in Brilliant Comedy...,"A flower's life span is nothing compared to humans, yet flowers go through similar developmental stages.  The most memorable part of a flower's growth is the blossoming progress where it goes from being a small bud until it dwindles to the ground in a rapid withering phase.  Occasionally, love uses the life span of a flower as a symbol for the affectionate spell under which two individuals bond.  When the flower withers, the relationship turns numb, which is the case with Ferdinando ""Fef"" Cefal (Marcello Mastroianni).  Fef merely stays with his wife Rosalia (Daniela Rocca), as societal restrictions are enforced by the Catholic Church, family, and public, which forces people to remain married until death do they part.  In the light of this notion, the audience will truly experience a socially important comedy, which plays with the ideas of divorce through more hideous plots such as murder, deceit, and other troublemaking."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Great Adventure Film For The Kid's: Adults Too!,"It seems surprising how long ago ""The Goonies"" came out: Over 20-years-ago. And it is still an entertaining film. Both of my daughters have seen this film countless times, and still enjoy watching it now and again. The commentary on the DVD is pretty good too, with some members of the cast reuniting [some for the first time since the film] with their own commmentary on what they remembered about the making of the film. This was a very good film for its time, and the cast of characters all complimented each other tremendously in this film. The film is not dated, and if anything it still retains the same charm it did in 1985. It is a timeless children's adventure film that will entertain many children for years to come: Plus, it boasts an incredible young cast of stars who would go on to their own acting fame.    "
dvd,4 of 4,4.0, RFK on DVD,"Next to ""RFK in His Own Words"" (not yet on DVD, sadly), this is the best documentary on RFK that is out there at the present time.  Covers most of the major issues (although the Cuban Missle Crisis segment is a tad too short and it doesn't include his classic South African Speech of 1966 which challenged young people around the world). Hopefully in the future, the latter could be included as a special feature."
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,IT'S A CARTOON PEOPLE!!!,"Sheesh!  My 4 yr old LOVED this movie.  I thought it was cute, sure it wasn't perfect Disney style, but you know what?  It entertained my daughter and frankly that's all that matters to me"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Great DVD,"Peter Cincotti is a great pianist and singer; his voice is full of emotion and very sexy.  I am so amazed at his arrangements, especially the upbeat ""I Love Paris""; I can never sit still and always feel like dancing.  From fast songs to slow songs, he draws me in.  It doesn't hurt that he's charismatic and quite dashing as well.  His band is also superb and beyond awesome.  I wish there were more interviews on the DVD, but I would recommend it absolutely. "

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Some Of Lugosi's Best...,This collection is a must for ALL Lugosi fans.
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,This is an artful piece of direction.,"I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round. "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The Best Movie in the World,"I saw this cinematic masterpiece with my French class, and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of French teenaged despair. We felt close to Vic, as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on Mattieu. Vic's parents seemed similar to my French class' parents, and so did Vic's school, with its social hierarchy and innocent parties. I feel that ""La Boum"" truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between American teenagers and their French peers. This effort is successful in my opinion, as our class found that we were laughing with Vic, crying with her, and screaming with her at her frustrating parents. We lived through ""La Boum"" in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl, and found that we weren't that much different, after all. ""La Boum"" made an impact on us more than ""Goodburger"" or ""Totoro"" ever could."
dvd,1 of 6,2.0,Spinal Tap goes folk...,"   'A Mighty Wind' seems to be 'This is Spinal Tap' done in a folk medium. Unfortunately, the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted, as another reviewer stated, from most of Christopher Guest's previous efforts. To put it mildly, halfway through the film I was half-asleep and wishing a dwarf would crush Stonehenge"
dvd,,5.0,Lest We Forget......,"Those of us who remember the closeted years before 1969, where the ""love that dare not speak its name"" remained silent, recognize the importance of documenting the hardships of gays and lesbians who lived in an era shrouded in secrecy and paranoia. This documentary does an adequate job of providing its viewers a brief glimpse into that era where there were no gay rights. I especially recommend this work to younger viewers who have little knowledge of what gay life was like before the Stonewall riots. In fact, dear reader, if you have never heard of the Stonewall riots, I implore you to purchase and view this documentary immediately!"
dvd,3 of 16,2.0,Long and Boring,"Long on loathing. Boring, I fear. This trip was at somewhere I've never been, and I don't want to go there. A place beyond the event horizon. Who could care less about these people? Great title for a book, or a film, though. For some reason I've given it an extra star. I don't know why. Perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody's collection of bizarre movies"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,All Hail Helen Mirren,"After seeing ""The Queen"" in theatres and being completely blown away by Helen Mirren's acting ability, I purchased the Elizabeth I DVD without having seen it, and I have to say that I have rarely been so impressed with any miniseries (or movie, or television show for that matter) and that is entirely due to Helen Mirren. This is a beautiful story, extremely well written and directed, and spectacularly acted. As Queen Elizabeth I, the notoriously hot-tempered, passionate, and arrogant woman who ruled England for 45 years, Helen Mirren makes us laugh with her, cry with her, and cower when she is provoked or challenged by someone questioning her authority. According to historical experts on Elizabeth I, this movie, and Helen's performance, come closer to getting at what the Queen was really like as a person than any other film has ever done."
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,Highly Recommended Set-When Can We Get the 6 Episodes of PS?,"I highly recommend this set. You get three funny films that will have you laughing each time you view them. The first is the best and they go in order from there but all three are good, fun entertainment. With such a low price, you can't go wrong buying this set. You get the theatrical trailers and three great commentaries as well. I hope to see a new set one day with more ""making of"" featurettes, deleted scenes, biographies, etc."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Clifford Odetts=Barton Fink,"This is a great movie which has as its theme the subversion of purpose by the Hollywood grist-mill and the trouble of screen adaptation from the writer's point of view. The character Barton Fink is based loosely upon the real-life difficulties of playwright Clifford Odets in the world of Hollywood. Jack Lipnick is Louis B. Mayer. W.P. ""Bill"" Mayhew is William Faulkner. The character of Audrey is most probably a melange of Howard Hawks's real-life script girl Meta Carpenter, with whom Faulkner carried on an intimate relationship, and Leigh Brackett who worked with Jules Furthman to adapt Faulkner's work/dialog for Hawks's movies. Great imagery (the sink drain leading to the drain pipe reminiscient of the flash-back transitions in Edgar Ulmer's ""Detour""), damned fine acting and smart dialog as well. Definitely the best of the Coen's"
dvd,,5.0,Befire Night Falls,"This story is so fascinating that I couldn't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer, Arenas, to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in Cuba under Castro.  Johnny Depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting Drag Queen"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Inspirational - Love this movie,"I love this movie, I love the actors, the setting, the story, the time period, the costuming, the humor.  A classic and so inspiring. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,More than crime,"This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great View of the CIA!,"This film seems very well researched, seeing as a former Directorate of Operations operative now public relations employee Chase Brandon, whom usually consults on authentic CIA portrals in hollywood movies such as Bad Company, Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, etc.  Although Chase has said in a DVD feature about certain aspects of the CIA not being acknowledged or not true, I would bet the techniques of combat that are brief in the film are authentic as well as disguising NOC agents through deceptive methods and the plot is mostly made up since I would suspect that the senior and / or higher ranking officers of the CIA would know of conflicting missions, even though to lower employees, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  This is the suspense in the movie that I will not spoil."
dvd,0 of 15,1.0,Melvin should have another serving of paste,"Directors, actors, and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral.  It's understandable, as it's a worthy goal.  99.5% of them fail - perhaps it's a lack of education, maybe it's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption, and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in Hollywood directly leads to this end.  The only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles (and this is not a new concept - it's typically an element of every movie).  It seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes: telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing, or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy.  This falls into the latter category.  I want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun."
dvd,,4.0,This movie was creative and enjoyable. An amazing movie!!!,"I like the idea of them bringing dinosaurs back to life. If I could bring dinosaurs back to life, I would not let them eat anybody!!!"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Forrest Gump,"In my mind, I had the bare bones of a scathing review that would showcase my slyness and writing skill. I was ready to hate this movie. Dumb guy juxtapositioned into great moments in history? Life is like a box of chocolates? Tom Hanks? Much to hate. However, I enjoyed it. If you ever see a guy in a white suit waiting for a bus, don't sit with him or he'll tell you his life story. I jest. It's a fine movie. "

These are not his nine best, but several are, and most  rank near the top of his legendary career.  Here are the reviews for the each movie:"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,An Excellent Summation of the Escaflowne series,"After watching the series, I found this movie to be an excellent summation of everything in its entirity. However, those who haven't seen the series may find it a little hard to follow, as some characters have little or no introduction. If you have seen the series though, its the perfect addition to your collection, as it is very entertaining and has a wonderful sound score"
dvd,5 of 28,1.0,How can you compare this to seinfeld? i can't give this a one,"I hated this show! Don't get me wrong, I am in love with shows like arrested development and seinfeld. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,'King of Hearts' is King in My Heart,"I have been going to the movies for a long, long time...starting in the late 1930's.  'King of Hearts' is very near the top of my list of favorites and I was delighted to be able to obtain my very own copy.  The premise asks the question, 'Who is Really Crazy? The gentle souls confined to an insane asylum or the warmongers on the battlefield?'  Though the actions of the actors is comedic and amusing, this can hardly be defined as a comedy.  It causes one to think a great deal about a very serious subject"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,"Shingen tactic of defending the domain, almost worked.","A thief is caught stealing a few coins, but fastinates the Lord because he resembles Lord Takeda Shingen.  The thief faces death by cruxification.  The double pleads for his life calling Shingen wicked.   Shingen admits he is wicked banishing his father and punishing his son.   Nobukado, Shingen brother saves the double because of his resemblance to Shingen.  The thief will act as a Kagemusha warrior confusing Shigen enemies: Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Definitely Hilarious,"This show is definitaly one of the funniest anime series made in a while, yet one of the least known. It was only four episodes, yet each one had it's quarks to them, from an anemic vampire, to a group of greedy monks working to shut out the Corporation. The only thing to dislike is that it was only four 30 minutes episodes long. One can only hope that perhaps with the flood of TV series remake of older OAV series, the Phantom Quest Corporation could get some more of their oldball cases."
dvd,,5.0,Great Intertainment!,"Great Plot!  A crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs; a good hearted man named Dave who thinks about others, and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance. Dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while.  Two of the presidents regular staff try to get Dave to do things that is contrary to Dave's character.  So the story goes on from there.  Who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the White House. This dvd  picture was good and clear, the sound was great, and the case was in excellent condition.  If you like warm hearted type movies, then this is the one for you.  I know I have enjoyed it over and over.  To me, Dave is about character, good or bad, and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Quality Movie That Adults Will Enjoy,*****
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Priceless!,"This is so funny, that everytime i watch it, it feels like the first time. Adam Sandler is by far doing his best in this part of SNL. I love the whole thing. This is something you better watch"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Ladies And Gents,This is a genre I and my daughter really admire.  She thought this one was a little too slow moving and overly postured but I liked it alot.  It possesses a certain sweet gentility while aptly expressing the mores and social boundaries of the era.  Not as lavish in scope as Pride & Prejudice nor as entrancing but this will keep you in your seat and enjoying the moments spent there

dvd,0 of 2,5.0,DA Funniest S***!!!!!,"Man dis has got to be da funniest movie I have seen by da Wayan Bros. It kinda goes a lil to far somtimes but dats da funny part. Da movie is basically about a guy named Ashtre who goes back to da hood to live wit his dad who is only about 1 year or 2 years older and from there da crudeness begins. Da movie is extremely hilarious it mostly makes fun of movies such as ""Menace II Society"", ""South Central"" etc. u know gang banger movies. U will have a lot of laughs wen u watch so watch it right away!!!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,If only the Beatles would have been able to reunite!,"The boys go way out of their way to recognize one another throughout this show, particularly Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce in their undisguised attempt to shower praise on bandmate, Eric Clapton, and all with great justification.  These three gents defined the power trio and their ability to fill the Hall with some of the best rock and roll/blues for their brief reunion shouldn't be missed by anyone who truly loves the genre."
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,This one is a keeper,"This is a good movie for relaxing.  Except for the incredible escape from the path of the train, the excitement is light hearted fun without an adrenalin rush.  The humor is based on wit and timing.  It works because it is real.  How different the story would be if Peter's family would stop talking and listen.  But it is a quirk of humanity that we can all identify with when the Callahans jump to conclusions rather than hearing all Lucy is trying to tell them.  The plot is complicated by the well-meaning Saul who assures Lucy he will take care of the confusion.  He has his own agenda.  The audience may know how the conflict has to be resolved, but the suspense is maintained well enough to keep the audience watching to the parting shot"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Almost as fine as the books,Longtime fans of Harvey Pekar (I was turned on to the American Splendor books as a college student in 1987) will absolutely love this! Very faithful to the original and to Harvey Pekar and what he stands for.
dvd,3 of 3,1.0,"I Agree with ""Unwatchable.""","Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.  "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,A PASSIONATE VALUER!,"Kevin Sullivan's TV movie ""Anne Of Green Gables"" is as unusual in theme as it is beautiful.  On the surface, this 4-hour adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel deals largely with everyday events (everyday, at least, for Canada's rural Prince Edward Island, in the early 1900's).  But in terms of fundamentals it is a richly romantic story about values and their role in human life."
dvd,,5.0,One of my favorite John Ford Films,"Great movie nice DVD extras.  Stewart, Wayne and Marvin all fantastic"
dvd,,4.0,"A better film than the first, however...","Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,A preemie twins grandma is thrilled,"Finally an answer for the mom's and grandma's of preemie multiples.  It was impossible to workout - being quarantined with preemie twins was intolerable during RSV season.  This video and guided audio for my strollertime power walk is my answer to prayer!  I am in shape again and the alone, isolated feelings and depression have been replaced with tons of energy-I so look forward to our daily walk/workout with my video friends!  Thank you Strollertime"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Refusing to say ""ninja action"" makes for a creative essay...","This movie is pretty much described well enough by everyone who writes about it, indeed.  It is about a transient man who breaks into people's houses and lives there for a few hours or a night, paying them back with repairs and housework.  When he meets the woman and they go off and live the same life together, it seems a rather tragic story as they keep running into trouble here and there, even getting caught a few times (admittedly, a couple of times they were just being stupid about it)."
dvd,,5.0,Fantastic animation with flaws,"I must admit I was really impressed with the CG in this movie. It seems great computer animation is steadily progressing. From Toy Story to War Planets then to Roughnecks:Chronicles of Starship Troopers, Final Fantasy takes the next evolutionary step. The lighting and level of detail in the animation is flawless. The humans are the most convincing you will find in a CG movie. There were 'actors' in some scenes were completely indiscernable from a real human being. I bet that if someone 20 years ago saw this movie they would wonder why the actors look so strange. It's that good. "
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Laugh  A Minute,"For all those Matthew Broderick lovers out there, this is the film for you. I am not a big Matthew Broderick fan myself but i do like Meg Ryan. However, together, in this film, they are a match made in heaven. Both are extremely funny. Even the character who is supposed to be hated while watching the film is also very funny. This isn't a very deep film if that is what you are looking for, tissues will only be needed to wipe away tears of laughter"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,One Of The Best Movies,"i loved this movie it was awsome i compare to it to the lost boys and fright night i like the way this one is made because they are not refered to as ""Vampires"" and they never show fangs i highly recomend this to anyone who is a fan of the lost boys or fright night"
dvd,49 of 49,5.0,Outstanding.,"When I first heard of NCIS, my immediate reaction was, ""Oh no, not another investigative show!"" Programs such as CSI, Cold Case, and Without a Trace have never impressed me; I find many of the characters bland, and though the cases themselves may be good, it's a show's cast that sells it for me. "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Hi, Bomb!","The most overlooked movie of the 1970's. Probably one of DePalma's best efforts. Also, a great example of DeNiro's early acting range. Funny, terrifying, brilliant. A great dissection of race issues, voyeurism, war, random violence, the family, and gender relations as well as a terrific homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window.."
dvd,,1.0,"It sucks, badly","Really, the whole movie sucks.  Let's start from the top, the plot.  Now, as you probably know, the plot has nothing to do with the game, at all.  In fact, the only thing remotely close they have is the name, and the BFG.  The plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day, you know the drill.  Nothing horribly bad, except for it doesn't follow the game at all."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Face----Off!,"Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson)has it all: he's a research scientist pioneering cutting edge treatments in skin graft technology, using his well-stocked science lab and dedicated science interns to develop synthetic skin. "
dvd,,4.0,Inspiration For Our Young People,"Beautifully done. Should inspire inner-city children across America to rise above their surroundings.

dvd,5 of 5,5.0,An Excellent Film: And A Very Unpredictable Ending!,"There are countless reviews here, so I will make this one short. First, I am always amazed when I meet people who say they figured ""The Usual Suspects"" out by the middle of the movie. I for one was totally floored. I did not see it coming, and was very surprised [no spoilers]. The film has been analyzed, dissected, discussed, and with over 500 reviews, written about quite extensively. However, one of the things I don't understand is why someone would give the film one or two stars. There are many 'good' films that have really never appealed to me, however, I can see that although I might not like the film, it is a good film. Therefore, I would not think of giving such low marks to film for this reason; but would give my analysis of what I thought was weak about a film: Yet, I would still give the film its earned accolades. This film was great however."
dvd,,4.0,Firefox,"There are no defects in the workmanship of this product.  Many of the older films made prior to DVD and enhanced sound systems, do not generate the quality sound that newer DVD's produce.  I would gather that this is because the older films did not introduce the higher quality sound capabilities when they were made.  Firefox is such an older movie.  I have rated this movie as a 4 star only because of sound quality"
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Flawless!!!,"This 4-disc set is loaded with extras including the 1925 silent version, but the real bonus is the flawless new transfer of what is definitely one of the best motion pictures ever made.  By going back to original 65mm materials, the picture quality is simply stunning revealing color depth and a contrast range never before seen in any of the previous tape, laser disc or DVD versions.  The subtlety and mastery that earned Robert Surtees ASC the academy award for best cinematography is clearly revealed in every frame of this bench mark film.  If you ever have the opportunity of seeing a 70mm print of this film on a huge screen; jump at the chance!  Until then, this new DVD version is a terrific alternative.  There are movies and there are motion pictures; William Wyler's production of Ben-Hur defines the term ""motion picture."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Before this movie was released, noone bothered to talk about it","Hotel Rwanda is a very important movie about a genocide which just happened a decade ago. Interestingly, until this movie was released noone in the Western world really bothered much about the topic. It seemed like this genocide, including the story of the U.N. as its bystander, was disappearing in the black hole of history. But thanks to courageous film makers, the story survived and shall remind us to seriously not let crimes like this happen again. The story Hotel Rwanda is not revengeful, yet it portrays the horrors of a time when all hope seems lost."
dvd,0 of 8,1.0,Bax Experience,"I ordered this movie on or around July 6, 2006 and have yet to receive it"
dvd,,5.0,AWESOME!!!," I thought this movie was very good. I love the Middle Ages time era, and the things that made this movie good was the fact that it had some history in it. Plus, I liked the way they showed that there were certain problems with traveling back and forth through time. And how at a certain point you won't be able to get back home:( Then, too the end of the movie with Maverick and Lady Claire buried in the tomb stone HE was actually digging up himself. It makes you wonder who would've been there in his place if he kept digging"
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,An Entertainingly Uncomfortable Film,"Even though you know what's going to happen to Tom Selleck's character, and you know that the ending will be happy, watching the process is enjoyably discomfiting.  This is a plot film -- stuff keeps happening to the main character, things he appears utterly incapable of controlling, and everything spirals right into disaster.  Great Friday night fare.  Make a lot of popcorn and savor it"
dvd,,5.0,Fun and educational,"My 21 month old daughter LOVES Elmo and the S.S. gang. She doesn't watch them on TV, so it was fun to get a story she'd enjoy that we could choose the scene (because of her short attention span and we don't want her watching too much TV). It's great when you can get it on sale"
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Cool Packaging - Same Releases,"First off, these are the same editions as found in THE HIGH SCHOOL REUNION COLLECTION set of DVDs.  If you own those - no need to double dip.  The transfers are the same, no extras, and yes... these are only the Universal owned ""Brat Pack"" movies.  Nothing has been changed to the three movies proper.  Original soundtracks are here for SIXTEEN CANDLES and WEIRD SCIENCE (tv versions often replace many of the songs, as did the VHS copies).  All of them are in enhanced widescreen with 5.1 sound mixes.  "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"It's not the A&E version, but it's pretty darn good","I am a fan of Pride and Prejudice and have been since high school.  I got a copy of the A&E version of the movie for my birthday and loved it.  This one is really amazing, concidering it had to condense everything down from 5 hours.  It's got excellent tension and you love the characters.  I love it and it is a quick alternative to the longer version"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Fun to watch, get ready to dance","A very well made documentary on a city wide public school dance contest that matches many several buroughs in NYC. The kids here are the ""movie"" and don't let down just being themselves. Funny early scenes include when dance partners are instructed to look at each other while dancing. This of course can be difficult as a grown up, but for kids it is almost unbearable. Another great wrinkle to this documentary are the interviews with the kids in regards to their dreams, visions, and their day-to-day lives. At times a little sad, but over all a delight to watch given their youthful ambitions and postive thinking."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Dave Barry... so it's gotta be good.,"I discovered Dave Barry in a Reader's Digest article titled ""The Martian Death Flu"". That short story inaugurated a fascination for all things Barry and ""Big Trouble"" is a faithful depiction of the mind of this Miami madman. This Pulitzer-prize winning columnist meets the director of ""Men In Black"" and TV's The Tick."

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"""Shall We Dance?""","When I'm fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should, the temperature is near 100, and the U. S. casualties from the War In Iraq now have reached over 2,500-- the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else--STRICTLY BALLROOM is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile. Set in Australia and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's all about winning the Pan Pacific Grand Prix ballroom dancing competition. Besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice, the story is one that most of us want to believe: that in the end-- after all that's what happens in romantic comedies-- boy gets girl, ugly duckling becomes suave swan, the older generation get a chance to try things again, or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children, and good triumphs over the cynical, bad guys."

When the series aired over here in Denmark, we sadlly enough had to put up with the teriblly edited versions of the episodes - the same version which were also shown in the UK! "

Nursing a crush on the younger son David, her frumpy and plump looks fail to attract his interest. When mother Maud sends Sabrina to Paris to intern with Vogue for several months she is transformed  into quite the French belle. Upon her return, Sabrina is met by David who has no idea who she is. Once back in New York, David is smitten, Linus is too, and the love Sabrina has wanted all along turns out to be the person who has been right in front of her and she hadn't noticed - workaholic Linus"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Very impressed,Dear Sir or Madam:
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Beautifully Disturbing,"Hard Candy is extremely disturbing on many levels; the premise, the dialogue, the violence, very awkward situations.  The acting is brilliant, Ellen Page is perfect at not showing any emotion.  The movie is also shot well with extreme close ups, and fantastic use of vivid color.  Essentially there are only two actors and mostly dialogue but the movie goes by quickly"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Gotta love Diego!,"We were very excited to see that Diego was finally on DVD!  My almost-two-year-old loves the TV show and all the animals.  He always asks for ""Deggo GO!"".  Dora and Diego are two of the few shows he watches and interacts with.  He has actually learned a lot of new words from the show and I like that he answers back when they ask him questions.  We've even made ""scavenger"" hunts around our home using Dora-style maps and hiding stuffed toys for our little Diego to find.  Dora and Diego are great!  I just wish there were more Diego episodes on the DVD"
dvd,,5.0,Monk,"Harassingly funny and just plain out right good clean comedy.  You can't help yourself, you just have to laugh out loud. Monk can put sunshine in a rainey day.  Sometimes I watch it more than once and still laugh just as hard."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,The Sentinel; a review of,"Frankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President's wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding).  If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV's 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in  this flick too.  I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing.  I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side.  I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Something You Can Sink Your Teeth Into Mulitple Times,"I always found this to be an outstanding based-on a true story adventure film which holds your interest throughout. It features some great suspense and the story is fascinating. . A good surround system doesn't hurt here, either, as DVD provides some great sound."
dvd,,5.0,A True Classic!,"Its pretty much a cliche to label an enjoyable movie a ""classic"". In my opinion, very few actually deserve to be called that, and this is one that does."
dvd,1 of 1,1.0,I am disappointed...,"Well...is this movie supposed to be funny, make you laugh, then make you scream too ? It said: COMEDY / HORROR....well...I wonder why I was laughing only in ONE scene where the Butcher Baker was eating the Gingerdead Man, then said ""Got Milk ?""...."
dvd,,4.0,Still wonderful,"While those who did NOT read book 4 might be puzzled, the film still holds great magic for the rest of us.  The telling of the tale, complex and dark, is handled well.  The special effects were excellent, the character growth wonderful and true.  How this will play out in future editions and movies is part of the magic of this series"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,A  few good dads?,"This is not a review of A Few Good Men, as such, but rather a review of its excellent director, Rob Reiner.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched this movie...it's that good...and there's little point to my echoing the excellent reviews already posted here.  But the other day I decided to watch the movie with the director's commentary on--something I rarely do because too often the directors/stars who do such commentaries yak on endlessly and wind up detracting from the movie rather than adding insight to it."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Tremendous Acting,"Dafoe's portrayal of techie, John Carpenter, steals the show in this film which effectivly captures the downfall of a downright perverted creep. "
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,"Wonderful, but sad","As sad as it is to any Believer, this was a wonderful movie.  I saw it in the theater and pre-ordered it here just so I would have it for all time.  The producers really delved into the minds and lives of Red Sox fans, showing the joy, hope and devastation that we all feel"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Entertaining Holiday Fun!,"This is one of the 10 best family holiday movies of all time! Not brilliantly written, but wonderfully entertaining. Dudley Moore plays an ambitious, but naive Elf who is easily manipulated and taken advantage of. Moore has the uncanny ability to be both heartwarming, and pathetic, to a level few other actors can attain. John Lithgow is at his maniacal best as the evil-hearted New York industrialist-toymaker who exploits Moore's Elfin character to near disaster. David Huddleston is genuine and loveable as ""The Big Guy"", Santa himself!"
dvd,,5.0,Insecurity at its Best,"Mr. Jealousy stands out to me as being a well developed and intelligently plotted film.  Sadly, as a 90's ""wanna-be Indie"" movie, it did not go very far.  Perhaps its biggest flaw is that the ""hero"" is really no hero at all.  He is your everyday guy that struggles with deep psychological issues that are richly translated into humor and sometimes romance."
dvd,14 of 17,5.0,&quot;My Name is __. And I'm an Alcoholic.&quot;,Truest Portral of Alcoholic Recovery I've Ever seen (outside of the actual rooms of AA)
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,should have been the third film,"I enjoyed Ice Cube in this movie, but I think Day-day and uncle Elroy could have been funnier, Debo was the best part along with the new character sticky fingaz but wtf happened to Debo"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Kathy's Power Step Workout,"I really enjoy this workout, it's a great all round lower body workout.  The powerstep aspect of this workout really increases the heart rate and adds variety to the workout. You choose whether to incorporate the powersteps so you can make the workout easier or harder and the fitter you become the more powerstep moves you can include in your workout, a great motivator to increasing your fitness level.  You can really feel your legs, especially your quads, burn in this workout. Enjoy!"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,one of the best,"Simon and Simon had it all--still does! A great pairing of brothers. A great bunch of ""friends"" who come to their aid.  And a great mom!  But what added to this series was one of the greatest locations in weekly tv drama, and great theme and music."
dvd,,4.0,Forget the nightmarish stories - it's an enjoyable fantasy romp,"It's tempting to imagine that the overwhelmingly negative reaction to Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm was down to Harvey Scissorhands' reputation. After all, hadn't the film sat on the shelf for a year because Gilliam and the Weinsteins were arguing over the ending? Hadn't Harvey fired the cinematographer and (quite rightly in my opinion) insisted that Samantha Morton not be cast over Gilliam's wishes? And wasn't the film suddenly rushed out on the market as part of the mass dumping of other troubled Miramax/Dimension titles when the real-life Grim Brothers were making their lucrative slash-and-burn exit from Disney? How could it possibly be any good?"
dvd,,4.0,If u think this is good u should watch Jones' 911 Road to Tyranny Film,Huge Alex Jones fan. All his docus are very informative. He can come off as a bit extra at times. Highly recommend this also watch his 911 Road to tyranny one of his best works ye
dvd,,5.0,Smooth as Silk,WHAT GREAT FUN to watch some of our best contemporary entertainers pay tribute to a great talent and a class act - and all for a good cause.
dvd,11 of 11,4.0,Focused on healthy habits rather than body image and technique,"PROS: This DVD is appropriate for younger children. It encourages movement and works major muscle groups. The movements are pretty simple, but technique is not the emphasis anyway. The instructor is kid-friendly, not overly made-up or emphasizing body image. Rather, she could be the babysitter or the kindergarten teacher. Emphasis is on health, not appearance, which is great. She teaches the names of some major muscles (biceps, quads, hamstrings, etc.) and talks a little bit about healthy food and energy. (Healthy snacks give you better energy to play!) It is great for my 4 & 6 yr. old girls. They are not frustrated with complex moves or too fast a pace. They are not thinking about how they look or whether they are doing the movements ""correctly."" It is fun, holds their attention, and keeps them moving. If you are wanting a DVD that promotes health, good snack habits, and exercise without stressing specific exercise techniques or how your body ""should"" look, this meets that criteria."
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,As good as the original and that's high praise,"See my review of the original &quot;Cocoon.&quot;  Much the same can be said for this sequel.  As another reviewer commented, the hospital scene between Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy is very touching.  There is good belly laugh material too, for example when the oldsters take on some arrogant young basketball hotshots.  I want to say a word for the soundtrack, too, the music.  Lovely themes, well done and well integrated.  This film and the original are good jobs all around and leave one (at least me) with a warm glow"
dvd,,4.0,So This is What OCD Is...,I'd not seen this celebrated movie until very recently.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,My 3 y.o. LOVES this series...and has for over a year! ,"We started with ""There Goes a Dump Truck"" which actually features a different ""Dave.""  This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both. "
dvd,,5.0,"Excellent!  Almost as good as ""Firefly!""","First, for the record, Tricia Helfer is one of God's gifts to man.  Her interaction with the good doctor/vice-president ranks as some of TV's best recent comedy.  Overall, in addition to Olmos, who is excellent as always, the most engaging characters are the women, including Grace Park as the Cylon who may have a soul, and Mary McDonnell, as the troubled accidental president.  I've not normally a sci-fi fan, but like ""Firefly,"" this series has something for just about everyone.  Even the political episodes, though a little silly, are intriguing.  Highly recommended. "
dvd,11 of 11,4.0,"UNIQUE AND UNCONVENTIONAL, BUT IT WORKS!","     Aida is an opera which has always been presented on the grand scale,  and here we have a completely different approach to this massive work.  It's been made very intimate and very immediate.  This has a positive effect on the drama itself, and it certainly gives a better opportunity to concentrate on the actual drama of Aida, Rhadames and Amneris.  The camera close-ups of the singers are especially helpful in this respect, and since all the lead singers are young and beautiful, this is really nice to watch.  The sets are beautiful, though they too are scaled for the smaller stage utilized here.  Overall, this is a wonderful way to experience ""Aida"", one that many will watch again and again."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Superb,"I learn something new everytime I watch it with my 2 years old son. It covers interesting information about each animal, like cows having 4 stomachs or penguins being birds that cannot fly.. etc And besides the traditional groupings of house animals, animals in the water, etc.. it covers more interesting groupings, like "" animals with furry faces, animals with stripes and dots, unusual animals, the animal alphabet..etc"" It is simply the best and caters to all ages"
dvd,,4.0,Frightening insight into a human beings obsession,"I heve not read the book but I liked the film because of the intense single minded quality that Gene Tierney was able to get through to us, the onlookers. She was magnificent, very stylish and showed once again how weak a man can be when in love with a woman. Even though the film is quite old, it has depth and interesting characters. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"""I just want to give you your lighter back""","Another movie that I liked and critics were hard on. The film is great until you get closer to the ending. I thought the ending was a bit lame and that the ""mutant"" son was not all that believable. Scary but not totally believable."
dvd,3 of 11,4.0,great video,I used this video to learn basic samba steps.  It was also useful to share Brazilian culture
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent!,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. Hard to label this one...comedy..drama...and a big-time suprise ending that any great thriller would be proud of...wow..I just didn't expect THAT! This is a really cool movie. A little heavier than Costner's usual light romantic comedy, but he's still at his best in these type of roles...Interesting and unusual movie."
dvd,8 of 9,5.0,Bitterly funny indy film about love and lust.,"This is a terrific little overlooked film,  worth watching with your mate especially if you're having problems!  Themes of jealousy and lust and friendship are mined by a top rate ensemble cast-  Tilly and Stolz  especially have a great believable chemistry-  and features standout cameos  by Parker Posey and Joey Lauren Adams. Obviously made on a shoestring  budget,  this film dares to go to those uncomfortable places in  relationships that we all experience,  but rarely see in films because of  the big budget studio whitewashing. Worth a look or two"
dvd,,5.0,"Complete History of Superman, 1939 - 2006","I was enthralled with the this DVD and learned many things I did not know, especially the history of Superman on film...at the movies as well as on television.  My Uncle had the original comic books, and I was lucky enough to have read all the original Superman episodes up to around 1962 when I started high school.  I remember paying 10 cents a copy and the triple sized copy which came out in June just when school was over for the summer and rushing out to get my copy so I could see what adventures Superman was involved in this time and what and how he would save the world from this time!  I remember George Reeves, Phyllis Coates, Noel Neill, Perry White's ""Great Caesar's Ghost"", Inspector Henderson....the whole shot.  This DVD brings all that out, plus more.  I highly recommend it for ""Dyed in the Wool"" Superman fans of all ages as well as just interested movie goers....it is interesting, fast-moving, entertaining as well as educational....it's good to see and hear what others have to say about what triggered their interest in Superman and what Superman is all about"
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,DVD All in the Family,I ordered two DVD's the third and fourth seasons of All in the Family after I had received season's one and two as Christmas gifts.  The DVD's came within three days after I ordered them. 
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,All in one place (mostly)..... finally,"So Friday the 13th is no Citizen Kane. Did you expect it to be? It is what it is. And it is highly entertaining. I will admit that I have a soft spot for the cheesy 70s and 80s horror genre, but I would have to say the Friday series is my favorite. And I am thrilled with this box set. I like the compact, slim case design of the box itself, the 2 movies per DVD also helps to slim down the whole package. Parts 3, 6, 7, & 8  have commentaries along with the film. I think the real gem, though, is the bonus disc with the DVD features on it. The Friday the 13th chronicles featurettes are very interesting. You can choose any of the eight movies in the set and get behind the scenes info, stories, etc. Some of the parts have more in depth featurettes than others (part 5 is downright skimpy and I was surprised part 7 wasn't longer). I know this is a silly point to make, but the Crystal Lake Victims Tell All featurette is not aptly named, seeing as how most of the persons in the interviews were not victims at all, but the girls who survived! I expected to hear more from characters who were actually KILLED by one or the other of the murderous Voorhees! Overall, I am thrilled with this box set though, and for any fan of the series it is a must have. Of course there are three other films (Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason - put out by New Line instead of Paramount) that are not included in the set. So if you are a TRUE Friday fan, you'll have to take it upon yourself to complete the entire series"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Compare and contrast,"The 'spotlight' reviews of The Maltese Falcon (1941) are on the money.  It remains a remarkably modern, cynical film that holds up very well today.  I remember my father talking about seeing it when it first came out, and talking of how, unlike so many other films, it moved like lightning.  Mysteries in particular were typically slow moving films with too much comedy thrown in for light relief.  The Huston version of The Maltese Falcon changed everything."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,"This video changed my life, and my diapers","This is an awesome amazing concert video. The band is tight, the sound is superb, the video footage is masterful. I felt like I was there in Central Park, smiling from ear to ear. When guitarist Warren Hayes joins for ""Cortez The Killer"" and ""Jimi Thang"" the show goes to a whole other level, I get chills listening to his solos."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Superstar Waiting to Happen,"Chris Cagle has recently stormed upon the music scene and this collection of videos of his singles shows the world why he is the next SUPERSTAR!  The passion, energy and amazing vocals are specatular.  Buy this dvd and see for yourself"
dvd,,5.0,Why can't they make more movies like this,"Excellent movie. Seriously, why can't they make more movies like this? Smart, well-acted, very dramatic, exciting. I could go on and on. Just a very satisfying movie....each of the thousand times I have watched it. If I accidently come across it on TNT or HBO or wherever, I have to sit and watch it until the end even though I have it on DVD right there on my bookshelf! I can't walk away!"
dvd,,4.0,A Different Travolta movie.,This is a little different that what some may expect from Travolta.  Enough action and twists to keep it interesting. 
dvd,2 of 7,4.0,Vlad sucked,"I would give this movie 5 stars if it wasn't for Vlad being a total jerk. I wanted to like him because he SEEMS like a good guy and the hero of the movie. But he flirts with everybody and cheats on everybody. By the end of the movie I wanted to see him get pounded. Other than that, the comedy was great and so was a lot of the drama. I loved the music"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Don't hesitate to buy RENT,"I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs! "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Total body workout,"I was a bit disappointed at first because I was expecting more cardio, but I really like it because it's different.  I specifically chose a Karen Vioght DVD because I liked her in Elle McPherson's Personal Best.  All parts of your body get a good workout.  This DVD introduced me (briefly) to yoga and I didn't know how hard it can be to hold those poses!  Some of the exercises are hard to do without the weight balls that Karen uses in the DVD.  I gave it four stars instead of five only because if you do the p.m. section on it's own (without doing a.m. first) there is no warm up.  I have found that I get a better workout now after doing it for a couple months because I am more familiar with the moves and probably perform them with more accuracy (using better form)"
dvd,,5.0,Excellent Civil Rights Film,The story of Malcolm X (El Hajj Malik El Shabazz) was dramtically and fantastically brought to life by Denzel Washington and director Spike Lee. This is a must see for any Afro-American (Black Muslim) as well as anyone else interested in early Islamic-American History. His struggles and achievements are displayed in the most truthful of fashions
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Will Leave You Howling for More,"Wolf's Rain is the best anime series I have seen since The Vision of Escaflowne.  The story, animation, and production values are far superior to any anime series or movie to come down the pike in recent years.  Wolf's Rain is deep and meaningful.  Anything else pales in comparison."

dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Yoo hoo!,"This is out of print, and the only way you can get it is to pay a lot of money for it.  Is it worth it?  Well, I certainly think so.  You get 34 black and white Mickey Mouse cartoons.  Some of the early ones are rather primitive, but they are still amusing, and it gets even better as it goes along.  If you buy this along with ""Mickey Mouse in Black and White Volume 2"", you'll have all the black and white Mickey Mouse cartoons.  What more can an animation fan ask for"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,In search of the populism as new! ,"The search for the forgotten average man as a publicity stunt require by a newspaper, and how backfired. "
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,Good Body Sculpting Workout with the Stability Ball,"This DVD has a 5 min. warm-up, three 15 min. sections: core/upper body, core/buns and core/legs, and an 18 min. total body segment consisting of exercises taken from the other 3 sections.  You can select each workout individually or customize your workout and have the segments play in any order you choose.  If you do core/buns and core/legs, you'll get a great workout for the lower body and abs.  Those sections offer a wide variety of effective exercises.  In core/buns you'll alternate between lunges and squats with dumbells and stability ball exercises.  In core/legs you'll use your own body weight and work the outer and inner thighs and abs.  For most of the ab routines Denise shows different levels of intensity. I wasn't crazy about the core/upper body section because it only has about 4 min. of upper body work.  I think the workout would have been better with a separate core section.  I also wish there was a stretch section. It didn't bother me to alternate between body parts.  Denise's cuing is fine and she doesn't move too fast.   Overall I was pleased with my purchase.    If you liked Shrink Your Female Fat Zones you'll like this workout.  This video has some of the same exercises; but I think this video is better."

dvd,7 of 10,5.0,A Native American Deerwoman In Seattle,"I have always loved John Landis.  His contributions to the horror genre have been minimal, but just from those few films(American Werewolf specifically, though Innocent Blood was very cool and very underrated), Landis definitely earns the ""Master Of Horror"" title.  Hell, he's pretty much a household name for horror fans based on the strength of Werewolf alone.  It makes you wish he had made more horror films.  Well, the Masters Of Horror series wisely chose him for one of their episodes, and we finally get another Landis horror offering.  While most of the series' episodes tone down humor and go for the throat, Landis lightens things up a bit, and who could expect anything else from him?  As for story, it's another human/beast theme, but this time digging into Native American mythology for it's monster.  This is an odd, yet very cool concept.  Basically it's a ghostlike woman from Native American folklore that's drop dead gorgeous, half deer, seductive and deadly.  This mythical figure is put into the modern and logical thinking world where, realistically, her killings are investigated by police and forensic science.  Landis has comedy is his veins, so the film is full of clever quips and oddball characters.  It also manages some moments of suspense and has a bit of graphic gore thrown in to remind us that this is indeed a horror series.  The featurettes are a real treat.  Landis has always been an entertaining interviewee.  Very energetic, funny, truthful and not afraid to swear.  He seems like a helluva fun guy to hang out with.  He's serious about what he does, yet never takes himself too seriously.  His philosophy on horror and comedy and the mixing of the two is dead on.  He truly knows how to make a ridiculous concept(he admits himself that the Deer Woman thing is downright silly) work by being serious when it's called for and schlocking it up when necessary.  He also makes a very valid point about how supernatural themes don't always need an explanation for why they're happening-that when dealing with fantastic ideas, there isn't a need to do so much explaining(I wish Hollywood directors would take note of that).  This applies in Deer Woman, coz she just is what she is, and never once do we figure out why she kills guys.  And anyway, who cares why?  We may never see another full length horror film from Landis, but this short film is a real treat for those of us who want a little taste again of what it was like the first time you saw American Werewolf and became a John Landis fan.  Great stuff"
dvd,0 of 2,2.0,Soo primitive,"The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the ""comics"" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring. "

dvd,4 of 5,1.0,Someone Involved With the Movie,"Some people have far too much time on their hands. Lots of bitterness here. We made this movie in 3 days for $900. It was a fun experiemnt for a bunch of friends to get together and have a good time. Someone at Dead Alive Productions saw it and made an offer. Would you turn down money? No, that would be stupid. Too bad these reviewers got NONE of the jokes. Zilcho. If you wanted to watch something good, you should have watched something else. Oh, thanks for the sale... I love royalty payments."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Men stopped wearing undershirts,"Yes, this film is the one with the famous hitchhiking scene! Also, the men of America stopped wearing undershirts when they realized how sexy Gable looked when he disrobed from shirt to bare chest. This is the prototype for screwball comedies and Gable's only Oscar. Highly recommended. A classic"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,An emotional rollercoaster,"This movie touches on all senses.  The story is about more than just three people.  In touches on circumstances, friendship, and life.  What are we here for and how should we approach life.  It's simple to think we are just on some ride that will eventually end.  The message is simple enjoy what you have...and be satisfied with what your given"
dvd,3 of 21,4.0,My rating is based on Eric Schaeffer's other movies!!,"Though I've not seen this one - I know it will be incredible.  For those of you who've not ""experienced"" his movie - FALL - please do so.  It is a truly wonderful movie.  As the other reviewer stated about the music in Mind the Gap, the music from Fall is, too - simply wonderful.  The singer is Amanda Kravat formerly of the group Marry Me Jane.  Also - check out Schaeffer's movie, ""Never Again"" w/Jeffrey Tambor, Jill Clayburne and Bill Duke.  You will scream with laughter. "
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,'I am big. It's the pictures that got small.',"Loved and hated initially for it's biting view of the business of movies, this is a dark movie about people using people and Hollywood using everyone. Gloria Swanson's last words on how much she loves everyone, "" . . . especially all the little people in the dark"" really seems to be Billy Wilder's comment about us and Hollywood, that is to say, we're all in the dark. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Rivetting stuff still,"I remember seeing this film on TV many times when I was a youngster and it always impressed me.  Now, in the context of all the films that have come and gone since, it's even more impressive.  It's the never-ending story of the struggle for your dreams, greed, retribution and redemption, all expertly played out by a perfect cast.  The film restoration is first class and the accompanying documentaries, insights, etc. are really fascinating.  Watch all those first and your viewing experience will be all the better"
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,An Arnie classic,"This is my favorite Governor Terminator flick. Great story and action. Predator boast some of the best action scenes and special effects of that time. The gore factor is incredibly high and so detailed, even now some of the scenes make me cringe. This is what a lot of so called action movies is lacking today. The raid in the beginning sets the tone for all the bloodshed soon to come. This movie is without a doubt a classic and belongs in anyones collection, if your into action. If you never seen this I dont know where the hell you been all this time. You'll be lucky as hell to find a flick a that can stand up to this, coming out now"
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,A Russian Classic Comedy.,"I have read one negative review about this film and I would like to clarify the statements made in it. I am Russian so, obviously, I like this film. It has typical Russian humor, it is a farce, so do not look for higher meanings in the jokes, it makes fun of the social standards of the Soviet regime as well as the people who served it so well. It features some of the best Russian actors that we love seeing and acting; they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well. If you are a tough judge of movies, then please make sure you know Soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in American movies before you call it crap. "

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,All the Right Company,"Dennis Quaid ranks high in our family video night; both the Parent Trap and the Rookie are among our young children's favorites.  For my wife and I, I rented In Good Company due to Quaid, and because the film intrigued me: its trailer and synopsis do not rely on quick action or screwball comedy.... it was different from most of what I see."
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Could've been better,"So what have y'all been smoking?  Sure, Jessica Simpson can sing (especially in her beginnings with 1999's lukewarm smash Sweet Kisses), but not particularly on this DVD.  She has some serious vocal affections that hinder her natural sound and distort her pop croonings (she comes off as a Britney wannabe).  Interestingly her most timid and boring tunes from In This Skin sound the best (including ""My Way Home"").  Her rendition of ""Take My Breath Away"" is decent, but her awful performance of ""Angels"" falls very short of expectations (she sounded much better on VH1's Divas Live).  In the end, her Reality Tour 2004 is a decent but much less stellar concert given by a girl who does have talent.  Throw out that Britney-trademarked growl, Jessica, and all the unnatural vocal affections and you can soar.  Decent, but not great"
dvd,3 of 42,2.0,"Clever, stylish, empty...","I saw the Korean DVD version of this film. Those who enjoy Quentin Tarantino's more commercially successful films (the deeply cynical and nihilist ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"") as opposed to his more subtle and interesting films (well, I have to say ""film"" rather than ""films"" -- QT made one decent film, ""Jackie Brown"" and when it failed at the box office he returned to his old style) will perhaps enjoy this. But even Tarantino fans may balk (or just feel bored) at the way in the last 1/2 hour the film diverges sharply from its main character and turns into simply a revenge horror film."

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,not my favorite seasons but still a must own....,"I had never watched Mr. Show up  until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on TBS slightly edited.  I was hooked and began recording every episode on Tivo, until I realized they seemed to be edited so I picked up the 4th season and loved it, there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing, my favorite being the story of Everest.  I finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times, and while I found myself laughing out loud often, I didn't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season, aside from one or 2 sketches, not too much really stick out like the majority of season four.  A must own if you're a true fan of the show, for the commentary alone"
dvd,,5.0,Laurence Fishburne Catapults to Stardom,"Although he was featured as the moral father in the landmark film ""Boyz n the Hood"" the year before and had been acting for ten years, ""Deep Cover"" was the film that made me sit up and take notice of Laurence Fishburne, then stand up and applaud.  ""Deep Cover"" was directed by Bill Duke and he fashions a film that allows Mr. Fishburne a tour de force performance."
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,How do you think Julia Roberts really feels?,"Watching Julia Roberts play a jobless, skillness single mother whose greatest glory in life was winning a local beauty pageant, might make you wonder what she really thinks. Though Erin Brockovich achieved success far beyond what most in her position would, Roberts is consistently playing down to a station far beneath her own. While not unique in this film or for this actress, its particular noticeable in the contrasts here. Roberts is the only true ""welfare queen"" that ever lived, the Queen of Hollywood playing a destitute single mother, giving a chance for the ""common American"" (or at least the lower middle class single mothers out there) to live vicariously through her. Does she actually empathize with her subject or feel only a professional patronizing cynicism, as if we, the peons of life, must watch a film like this to lift us up from our ""hum-drum little lives"" (to borrow a quote from Jean Hagen)? "
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,"A little embarrassed to admit, but...",I bought this DVD. 
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Magnum Opus,"This is a perfect western and also one of the last of that genre for a long time. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" has cinematography that is brilliant. The environmental shots add to the plot and there is a slow build up until the unnervingly ultraviolent climax. Each scene fits in a post modern apocolyptic take on law and justice in the western genre. Auteurs had always had a fascination with westerns (such as Jean Luc Godard with Johnny Guitar) but ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" obviously was mined for great effect by Quentin Tarantino (consider both Kill Bill movies) and other aficenados. Without elaborate special effects or hip irony, a story about corruption and murder is revealed scene by scene in this cinematic masterpiece. And with Dario Argento credited for the ""screen story"" you could tell great minds were at work in putting this together"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Mock On!,"More than 20 years old now and a little dated, Spinal Tap is still loads of fun with the ""mockumentary"" gang including Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (who did the delightful ""Best in Show"" in 2000).  Every aspect of `60s and `70s rock music is lampooned.  Surprisingly, director/interviewer Rob Reiner comes off a little flat--but maybe that's just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters.  ""Big Bottom"" (a sendup of ""Fat Bottomed Girls""--one of my politically incorrect favorites), the ""sophisticated"" ""Sex Farm"", and the controversial ""Smell the Glove"" (ultimately released as Tap's ""Black Album"") are among ""Tap's"" big hits.

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Faithful to the Literary Spirit ,"This is a well-produced and written sequel. It is faithful to the original production and to its literary roots in a concise form. I extremely enjoyed it and found it to be a good follow-up to the lives of the central characters from the original ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. The cast was very good and gave very credible and memorable performances. I was very impressed with Frank Converse, an actor I always liked and it was good to see him in a substantial role once again. Megan Follows is once again brilliant and very charismatic as Anne Shirley. The print is very good making the details of the sets and beautiful outdoor photography emerge quite stunning. I highly recommend this one. "

Compared to a lot of other animated films that are appealing to adults (i.e. Shrek, Shark Tale), this is still a children's film and doesn't contain a lot of humor that's over the heads of its audience.  All three generations of our family have enjoyed this film together"

dvd,2 of 2,1.0,Basic concept missed,"The music and dance moves are fun BUT a basic concept in exercise was missed here. All of the shots are taken from the front. Unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the OPPOSITE side of the body that you are viewing, you will be awfully confused. It is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from BEHIND, so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body."

dvd,6 of 7,2.0,The quality of this movie is bad,"If you are expecting a dvd high quality transfer, you will be disappointed. The entire 4 and 1/2 hour dvd is just like watching a poor vhs quality tape. It's very grainy and faded. It even flickers occasionally just like a vhs tape. The movie itself moves along too slowly and has the feel of the type of movie you could fall alseep to late at night. Get the 2004 Jackie Chan version. It is highly entertaining"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Great capsule of the entire Osmond family's career,"This video, produced for the Arts & Entertainment Network's ""Biography"" series, is a nice overview of the entire Osmond family's musical career.  Narrated in the traditional style of other ""Biography"" broadcasts, the video features many photographs, interviews and rare film and video clips of the entire Osmond family growing up in show business from 1960 to 1999.  Aside from interviews from all family members, the show is interspersed with viewpoints from Andy Williams, Mike Curb (who produced much of their recorded material) and an editor from Rolling Stone (who admitted he purchased a 45 of ""One Bad Apple"" when it was released, much to the possible consternation of his fellow editors!).  Although all of the video clips are enjoyable, there aren't as many as an avid Osmond fan might want.  I would have liked to have seen more segments from the Andy Williams Show and a clip from their great performance of ""Yo-Yo"" from Flip Wilson's variety show.  Understandably, it IS tough to highlight forty years of entertaining in a one hour program.  The major theme of the entire program for the viewer is that of the remarkable binds that the Osmond family possess.  Each Osmond brother (and Marie) relate the support that they received from each other.  Even though their popularity has ridden the standard show business wave, every member of the family was involved in each other's undertakings and incredibly supportive.  The family has held to their strong moral beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints within an industry that, obviously, is skeptical of Christian thought and practice.  They all believe that their faith and family unity kept them away from the temptations that show business offers.  Aside from some great music and undeniable talents exhibited over a long period of time, I came away with a greater appreciation and repect for the entire family because of this video"

Conan and his writers make for a very entertaing show, and it's just tough to draw fans away from it.  But I think Craig is actually quite funny himself!  The few times I have actually watched his show, I have been well entertained!  He has a unique perspective and brand of comedy, and it works!  Besides, it's not like he can be Mr. Wick anywhere outside ""The Drew Carey Show!""  Once Conan takes over ""The Tonight Show,"" I will gladly flip over to Craig at 12:35."

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"Enjoyable, and worth watching for more than Bardot.","I saw this recently on a lark just to see what all the Brigitte Bardot fuss was about -- and wasn't expecting much since sex comedy farces (particularly French ones) aren't high on my film watch lists -- but was surprised at how good (and good-natured) it was.  Besides the vivacious charms of Ms. Bardot, this film had a solid script and good acting and dialogs. (One of my favorite lines had Bardot replying to a query why a family won't sell its puny shipyard to the effect that they want to at least still *own* something to not to feel poor.)  The story is not highbrow, but is far from being lowbrow and tawdry and exploitative as some newcomers (like me) might perceive from its notorious reputation. Bardot plays Juliette, the ""town tramp"" of St. Tropez  who is pursued by a rich, elderly playboy while carrying the torch for Antonio, an impecunious shipwright who treats her just as a convenient one-night-stand.  In comes Antonio's younger brother, Michele, who truly loves her and offers to marry her to save her from being sent back to the orphanage. Juliette marries Michele and comes to love him despite herself, while fighting against her reckless, impetuous nature as Antonio comes back into the scene and presents a constant temptation.  Will love or lust wins out?  Call me old-fashioned, but I liked how the movie ends, and I agree with another Amazon reviewer's analysis (Robert Cartland), which hits it square on the head. (BTW, the video transfer for this Criterion DVD edition is excellent, eliminating all the old flaws while preserving the warm, vibrant colors of the St. Tropez location to great effect.) "
dvd,,5.0,A Masterpiece,"With one of the greatest directors of all time at the helm of the picture, as well as one of the screens greatest actors and his wife...""The Big Sleep"" should be a surefire hit. And it is. In fact, it's one of the strongest moments in Humphrey Bogart's career and we all know he had quite a few strong moments under his belt. In this film (directed by Howard Hawks), Bogart plays Philip Marlowe; A Private Detective created by writer Raymond Chandler. The film itself has a kind of confusing plot, but that doesn't matter. This is one of those films where the plot takes the backseat; The film is completely fueled by the performances and especially the dialogue. This is the first film I've seen with Bogart and Bacall together and it's not hard to see why they ended up falling in love in real life. Their chemistry onscreen is so great. I'm not going to both explaining the plot, instead I'll quote Roger Ebert on it. ""The process follows private eye Philip Marlowe as he finds his way through the jungle of gamblers, pornographers, killers, and blackmailers who have attached themselves to [a] rich old general (Charles Waldron) and his two randy daughters (Bacall and Martha Vickers). Some bad guys get killed and others get arrested, and we don't much care-because the real result is that Bogart and Bacall end up in each other's arms. The Big Sleep is a lust story with a plot about a lot of other things."" Whenever I'm asked ""what movie contains my favorite pieces of dialogue?"" I immediately cite Pulp Fiction."

But some others may find its a waste of time because the 3rd vol wasn't as good the the previous few.  But the story continues with this volume and then onto the Justice League as well.  For those of you who aren't avid fans of Superman, I'd suggest skipping this one"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Masterpiece from Robert Altman,"""Short Cuts"" is a film by Robert Altman, but it's not a film that you hear mentioned a lot when his work is brought up. Even though it's in The Criterion Collection, you don't hear a lot of people talking about it. Sad, since it's a really good movie. I didn't know anything about the film before seeing it, except I knew that it was an ensemble film that was more than 3 hours long (the credits start a 184 minutes). To me, that sounded overly long...So when I began watching the film I was a little skeptical. Having finished it, I want to tell you that I've seen movies that were 90 minutes long that went by slower than this did. This is not a perfect film, but it has characteristics that could make it one. For example; In 184 minutes, there is never a wasted scene. There is no scenes that could be cut completely from the film without affecting the outcome. It's made in a way where every scene is pivotal. The movie is broken into several different stories (cuts), which are based on the writings of Raymond Carver. One of the storys is about Ann Finigan (Andie MacDowell) and her husband Howard (Bruce Davison), who's son has just been hit by a car. Although he quickly got up and walked home after the accident, he is quickly hospitalized for internal injuries. As they're at the hospital, Howard is reunited with is father Paul (the late, great Jack Lemmon); Who makes some shocking revelations. The next involves Marian Wyman (Julianne Moore) and her husband Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine, far away from ""Full Metal Jacket"" territory here), and Ralph's insecurities about Marian's past infidelities. Then there's Lois Kaiser (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Jerry Kaiser (the later and underrated Chris Penn). Lois is a home-phone sex operator and Jerry is a pool cleaner, who's going frustration with his wife's job will end in tragic (yet, non-cliched) results. Honey (Lili Taylor) and Bill Bush (Robert Downey Jr.), who are house-sitting an apartment for a couple for free. Sherrie Shepard (Madeleine Stowe) and her husband Gene (Tim Robbins), a cop who's having an affair with Betty Weathers (Frances McDormand). Betty's husband Stormy Weathers (Peter Gallagher) senses his wife is having an affair, which will end in hilarious results. There's a whole array of other characters as well. Some of the stories are intertwined, some are not...One film that popped into my head throughout my viewing of this movie was ""Magnolia."" I want to say right now, if you didn't like Magnolia. You probably will not like Short Cuts. If you didn't like Magnolia solely because of the frog thing, then you might like this movie. They're both simalar no doubt. They even end in a simalar way. Magnolia ended with frogs, Short Cuts ends with an earthquake. The movie perfectly blends it's subtle comedy and drama and give it's huge cast of actors opportunities to show off. None of the actors are weak in their roles...In fact, actors I've considered weak in the past come off quite strong in this movie. I've seen a lot of ensemble movies in my time and there's been times where I've wanted to see one side of the story more than the other (the Philip Seymour Hoffman aspect in ""Happiness"" for example). In this film, each storyline is just as interesting and entertaining as the previous one (especially the one involving a dead body that I forgot to mention). The movie won't appeal to everyone for a number of reasons; It's running time, it's subject matter, it's style. I thought it was a terrific film. This is the first movie I've seen by Robert Altman and I gotta say. If any more of his movies are like this, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more."
dvd,,4.0,...But I Was,"Michele and Fillippo, the two little boys who are rescuer and victim respectively, may not have been scared as they each demonstrate unique courage and rapidly growing friendship when confronted with an ongoing terrible situation, but as a parent, I sure was.  The obvious reason is for the kidnapped child, pale and almost savage from his captivity beneath ground, while his mother pleads for his life on national television in Italy.  But the more subtle cause is for what happens to Michele, ten years old in one sun-drenched summer in southern Italy, as he gradually comes to realize that none of the adults in his small remote village are to be trusted.  This loss of innocence is as painful to watch as his own humanity and courage are stirring.  His solitary stand against adult perfidy leads the film to its tense finale as the two boys inspire each other to separate acts of bravery at great personal peril.  Taut from start to finish, I'm Not Scared is a masterful work throughout."

dvd,6 of 11,1.0,Might as well jump on the bandwagon.,"Though OzzyApu and Squash & Squeak wrote very good reviews for this horrid show, I'll put in my two cents.  "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"Fun, fun, fun! Low impact but fun DVD","The way you move your hip and legs for this dance is similar to that of belly dance, I think. It's VERY tiring if you are not used to it. It's different from any other dance styles. I take various styles of dance lessons regularly and I consider myself fit, but I was exhausted after trying this DVD. I wouldn't call it a high-impact aerobics, though. I didn't sweat or anything, it's just you'll feel it in your legs till you gain more strength in the area.  "

dvd,0 of 6,1.0,I am not putting any part of that dog in my mouth!,"If Disney ever wanted to make the argument that they have not lost touch with their childhood roots, I would strongly suggest not mentioning Snow Dogs in that argument.  Sure, the numbers showed that this film was a success (i.e. the budget was $35 million and it took in $81 million in the US alone), but the final product that was released to the screen was nothing but sheer drivel.  From the unoriginal story, to the inconsistent characters, to the painful acting of Cuba Gooding, Jr., Snow Dogs proved two truths.  The first is that Disney can successfully make and mass-produce B-level cinema.  The second is that they can make Oscar-winning actors give the worst performances of their careers.  Snow Dogs demonstrates fully that some people in Hollywood choose money over scripts, they choose flimsy over developed, and recycled over original.  What upset me the most about this film was the use of CGI to exaggerate the dog's expressions.  To me, that is a huge slap in Cuba Gooding, Jr's face.  If the studio didn't think that Cuba could successfully make the audiences laugh, then they needed to get stronger talent, do not muddle the genre with CGI created eyes, mouths, and expressions on the dogs.  With this CGI, I felt as if I was watching a quick fix to an already unfixable problem."
dvd,25 of 26,5.0,One of Altman's Finest Films,"Barely released in 1984, director Robert Altman's ""Secret Honor"" is an unheralded masterpiece -- and this Criterion Collection DVD has been long overdue. Fueled by Philip Baker Hall's bravura performance as Richard Nixon, Altman's cinematic translation of the Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone play remains among his finest films. Ironically, this fictional portrait of Tricky Dick is more revealing and authentic than director Oliver Stone's overwrought ""Nixon.""  Highly recommended."
dvd,1 of 8,5.0,Stagecoach,"I was extremely pleased to receive the Stagecoach film dvd from you.  I was especially pleased with the arrival time of this product.  It was here in just a few days, just as you promised!!!  The film is excellent and I wish more of the old films would be released in dvd form.  Most of them are better scripts than the movies of today!!!"
dvd,6 of 10,1.0,An Abomination,"With great anticipation and relish i awaited this accumulation of the works of probably one of the greatest playwrites of the 20th century. Having seen a short promotional film of the project, my eagerness was picqued.But, alas, flash, star-worship and diminished expectations rule once again in this travesty. Having actually not even been able to sit through the Endgame of this set, and having also seen the foolish, punk-flash version of Breath, and the unsympathetic and misunderstood, braindead interpretation of Not I, i am so appalled i nearly whipped this weighty and overly expensive set, frisbee-like,out the window."
dvd,,4.0,Generally Speaking,"One of the better performances I've seen from Travola.  With that said I liked the story line and the plots twists and turns.  I would have liked to have seen more stories with this character made, as I am an avid fan for detective stories and what not"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Yet another brilliant show cancelled far too soon,"As I write this, 28 others have already reviewed this box set and 27 of them have given it 5 stars with the lone dissenter giving it a respectable 4 stars.  I think that probably speaks for itself."
dvd,,5.0,Better Than Citzen Kane,"Now considered the greatest American Film, yes, greater than Citizen Kane, The Searchers was always a John Wayne-John Ford favorite, but lately the critics have chimed in. Ford records once again and for all time his actors in the backdrop of an unreal place, Monument Valley. The jutting rocks placed before the camera as if an Ansel Adams photograph excites the eye.  There's much to be said for a good shoot site.  This one is the best of all time.  The framed shots from within The Edwards cabin, a photo of Wayne coming and going as the lonely American without connection to his family, a beautiful allegory in cinema."
dvd,,4.0,A Long though Wonderful Film,"Meet Joe Black is a re-make of Death Takes a Holiday, a 1934 film directed by Mitchell Leisen. This classic differs from the re-make in many respects, however, Joe Black, despite its length, (three hours) maintains its own particular magic. Though many critics praised Sir Anthony's performance, Brad Pitt as Joe Black carried the film."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Amazing Program,"I got this DVD after reading dozens of glowing reviews. Now that I've used it, I am thrilled to have this DVD in my collection. The tests set up in such an intuitive manner, with helpful instructions on how to use each one. A complete walk-through takes you through the basic adjustments in detail. I was amazed at how out-of-line the picture on my television really was! The difference now is amazing! 5 stars for this amazing program"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent Courtroom Drama,"Gene Hackman and Mary Mastrantonio are great in this class action case involving Argo, a automobile manufacturer. In this case a car manufacturer tries to hide a defective wiring circuit that can cause a car to explode. Interesting that here Hackman is fighting for the little guy, while in ""Runaway Jury"" he was the corporate lawyer. I am glad they are finally releasing Class Action on DVD February 1, 2005. Why they didn't before that is beyond all of us familiar with the movie."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Wonderful movie!,Wonderful movie!!  I love the way Mr. Holland got the message across to his students whenever they had a problem learning about music
dvd,2 of 16,1.0,Here's my two cents about Three Coins...,"I must go easier on this film than I would like seeing as it was made in the 50s. Being 19, I'm sure I can't appreciate the calm and painfully cheesy medea of that era. Still, I AM a fan of old movies and enjoy the laid back plots of the older days. O brother. This plot was certainly laid back - in fact, I think it laid all the way back and went to sleep! Three girls fall for three guys. The end! Each girl ended up with the first guy they liked, no surprises or intrigues. There was a gliche to each relationship, but it was ironed out smoothly before you could actually figure out what the big deal was. Two of the men were goony dreamboats, madly in love with their American beauties. The other was a cranky boss who tried terribly hard to be endearing but missed the mark by a mile. Quite predicatable, extremely boring... stick with the good oldies such as Born Yesterday, On The Town, Roman Holiday and the like. "
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,Nothing Like Home Movies,"This show's completely original and always thoroughly enjoyable. to sound pretentious it's kind of like comedy jazz, a lot of improvisation and it puts you in just one of those ""takin it easy"" kinds of moods. even the smallest details can be hilarious, especially for film buffs. anyway what compells me to recommend this season especially is the bonus CD with all the great songs from the show, amazing!!! i've been waiting for something like that since it was the first show ever to be shown on Adult Swim back in, well, I guess it must have been 2000! if you've got a funny bone and a brain you can't go wrong with this.."
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,A work of art.,"I just finished watching 9 Souls just minutes ago and I must say this is an amazing movie, anybody who even remotely enjoyed Blue Spring's NEEDS to see this movie."
dvd,,5.0,Worth every penny,"This is a very enjoyable documentary. Ordinarily, I don't watch movies a second time. But this one is so good, I purchased it. This film follows two surfers from 1960s America as they travel around the world in search of the perfect wave. They are gentlemen. It is interesting to see the world welcome them -- Americans from a kinder, much less-vulgar era. Even though it is now forty years old, the production value is high. The soundtrack, commentary, and beautiful scenery all contribute to a very well-made film. Forty years later, people continue to buy this movie"
dvd,2 of 5,4.0,This Is A Great Film Starring A Great Actor,I caught this movie on TV one Saturday afternoon while flipping through the Channels.  Seeing Harvey Keitel got my attention but the movie itself kept it.  It's a really good movie.  I was suprised that I hadn't heard of  it before.  Check it out.  Its a great deal especially at the price Amazon  offers it for
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,A real barn burner,"Niles and Holland Perry are seemingly about as different as night and day, but they are also inseparable. They play together all the time, get into mischief together and share secrets. It appears the two have some pretty dark secrets. Based on a novel by Tom Tryon, this film takes its time setting the mood and introducing its horrific themes. In ways it plays like a nostalgic trip down childhood memory lane, with buying fresh vegetables from a traveling farm market, stealing cookies from the oven and spending lazy afternoons fishing in the local pond. Director Robert Mulligan brings much of the natural, rural feel to ""The Other"" that he brought to some of his other movies, such as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Man In the Moon."" With it, he lulls into a sense of comfort and complacency that belies the evil that lurks nearby. This really is a masterfully crafted movie and, although I have not read the novel, I can say the story unfolds much the way a book does. My only gripe would be the performance of the boy who plays Niles, Chris Udvarnoky. I realize he is supposed to be a nice, polite kid, but he is so over the top I could barely stand to watch. Not only is he saccharine sweet, but he occasionally gets his intonation all wrong, as though reading from a book. He was only about ten when he made the movie, so I must cut him some slack. I just thought Mr. Mulligan might coax a really good performance from his child actors the way he did in the two aforementioned films. Despite this, ""The Other"" is a very good film and the DVD, though lacking any bonus material, does have a very clean picture."
dvd,,5.0,Great Movie !,This is my favorite Paul Newman movie; a great movie all around.
dvd,,5.0,What a great buy!!,"I bought this DVD because I liked the idea of flexibility with regard to length of workout, target muscle groups and variability in exercises.  I LOVE this DVD.  The instructor gives great cues after demonstrating the exercise.  I am not looking to lose weight, but to tone my body, and this is the way for me.  I feel like I have a personal trainer without the expense and bother of travelling from my home!"
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,Wonderfully developed critique of 70s culture,"Although this movie is definitely an acquired taste, it does an excellent job of keeping up with over one dozen main characters by tying them together with the major role: Nashville, itself."
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,Raging Bull is one of those superb films at its finest.,"Raging Bull"" has been called the  greatest film of the 80s. After seeing this film last night I would say it is one of the most powerful films of all time. De Niro, was also at the top of his game here, as Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced that she is cheating on him, and that is more or less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper, harbored anger. "
dvd,,4.0,Important subject.  Allow yourself to be the judge.,The DVD's principal point is that our current voting system has disturbing barriers and a shocking lack of safeguards.  I'm not sure how exposing this danger can be considered unpatriotic or worthless by other reviewers? 
dvd,,5.0,"Cute, fun, Hilariously crazy!"," This movie, I have seen back when it came out, and I loved it! I watched in alomost everyday, and vnever got tired of it! I saw it again and loved it like the first time I watched it. Light, and cute! Keeps my mind happy, and entertained! I definetly suggest anyone to watch this movie. Especially if you feel misunderstood or out of place, this movie will pick you up, and show you that you are not alone."
dvd,1 of 1,1.0,I want a refund!,I wouldn't recommended this workout DVD to anyone! There was way too much chit-chat and it was very difficult to follow the three instructors. I've had this DVD for less than two weeks and sold it in a local pawn shop for $2
dvd,,5.0,Love this Crunch dvd,"Another great Crunch DVD. I love all of Ellen's workouts.  Great cues, great workout, and the music is even ok.  A pilates workout"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Overall a good view of the story of David,"While most movies take artistic license to the extreme, I felt this movie for the most part stayed the course of being accurate.  I could go over the obvious mistakes but I don't think it strayed that much.  At first I was more enthralled at Gere's performance as David the boy rising to be king.  But, the more I watched it, I honed in on the fall of Saul.  How a man's envy lead to his total ruin."
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Chaplin's satire on tyranny,"This was Chaplin's first all-talky picture, and the results are mixed. The movie is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people in high places squirm. "
dvd,13 of 21,1.0,Superficial,"Whatever happened to the glory days of French cinema like Truffaut, Godard etc, now replaced by unimaginative ""realists"" of the type represented in this movie. From the cardboard cutout characters to the inane ""plot"" this is a film that only teenage girls of 17 and a half could empathize with. This film doesn't tell you anything you haven't seen before in the ""coming of age"" category...oh, the confusion, the tears, the lousy sex, the intolerant parents etc etc. The only redeeming feature is the actresses who do a brave job with the atrocious screenplay"
dvd,154 of 158,4.0,Basil meets George,"I like this show, I recommend the DVD, but can we please be honest about what it is, and why it is good when it is good?  The show is marketed as ""flinchingly realistic.""  It says that on the box, and that seems to be the perception, uncritically repeated in everything written about the show.  We are supposed to believe that it is a realistical show because people play themselves and the scenes are adlibbed.  But the subplots of the shows are actually very contrived, woven together very formulaically, and all require an astronomical series of coincidences to make them all pull together in each shows finale.  The shows remind me more of Fawlty Towers than of Seinfeld, in that each show consists of Larry David reacting to things the way we'd all like to react if we had no frontal lobes, and by the end of the show everyone is angry at the protagonist whether he is trying to do good or harm.  There are moments that feel very realistic, and are very entertaining, like Larry David and Richard Lewis adlibbing with each, which Richard Lewis in one of the DVD extras reports is a very authentic and surreal experience.  Most of the scenes though, in the service of the plot machinations, require the characters to quickly get infuriated with each other.  If it is ""flinchingly realistic"" at all, it is realistic in the sense of portraying honest human interactions minus the superego.  And that is when it's funny.  For example, when Larry David's manager's wife asks him if he would like a tour of their new house, and he says no.   And Larry David's reaction to having his in-laws decorate a Christmas tree in his house."

You won't regret hanging out with the Doctor, Rose, her crazy mother, and her ex-boyfriend/best friend Mickey.  Take a load off with this crew...you won't forget it"
dvd,,5.0,This is a wonderful movie,"This has to be one of my all time favorites, along with ""An Affair to Remember"" and ""The Notebook.""  Richard Gere is fantastic in this role and as you listen to the commentary on the making of the movie you realize how seriously he took the role.  He practiced many hours in order for things to look professional and that translates into superb dancing technique. Stanley Tucci is a hoot in this movie and he as well did a great job dancing. Jennifer Lopez was so interesting to watch and as her character evolved she too transformed in front of our eyes.  Susan Sarandon did an excellent job playing the wife of Richard Gere.   All in all this was entertaining from beginning to end.  The music was inspiring and the ballroom scenes with the quick step and the waltz were my favorites. If you enjoyed watching ""Dancing With the Stars"", you'll love this movie!"

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,TBS Superstation.,"I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS. It's now 11:30PM, and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago. Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot. There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life. I was touched by the movie. Thank you. I should go to bed now"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,great price. a good buy,"back to the future is a piece of my youth.  it was great to revisit these movies - corny as they may be at times.  the first one is the real ""film,"" with the clocks in the beginning and the running theme of time.  the second one is pure fun; the magic of the future-world and the self-referential, interweaving plot line.  the third is also entertaining, especially if you like the old west genre (or maybe not if you take the old west genre too seriously).  i ate these movies up and enjoyed myself. "
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Movie Was Very Good,This was a very good movie. In the other reviews people have never seen it until it came to Lifetime tv. But I can say that yes I see it the first time it was ever on tv which was about 1995 on NBC Monday Night Movie of the week. It doesnt really matter where or when you seen it most people will agree that it is a good movie. I think it detailed out some of the abuse that many young teenage girls take from jocks or boys peirod while in high school.
dvd,,5.0,GREAT!  I watched it twice in a row!,"After I borrowed this movie from my mom's house I dreaded putting it in. I thought it was going to be a long, drawn out & boring old-time flick about snobby people gossiping about each other. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. It caught my attention from beginning to end. The characters were SO likable. Yes, even the two-faced snobby rich sister, annoying mother & giddy younger sisters! They bugged me but made the movie that much more enjoyable. It was very nice how the script was able to portray the way of life back then. Although the Bennets lived in what we consider a huge house they were considered penniless. 5,000 pounds a year was considered rich. Trying to marry off your daughters to the wealthiest man possible was a goal a mother must bear (at least THIS one)."
dvd,,5.0,Great movie for whole family,"If you saw the original promos for this movie when it came out, you'd think it was a cornball movie about talking dogs - it is not.  It is a clean, light-hearted comedy (with one mirage scene where the dogs talk to Dr. Brooks just before Michael Bolton talks to him from the cover of one of his CD's).  It places a black dentist from Miami in an isolated, almost completly white Alaska town (Tolketna) where some people don't seem to own a toothbrush.  Dr. Brooks tries to find out about his heritage as he explores the world of his deceased birth mother and looks for information on his bio father.  "

Hellraiser blew my mind."
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,"A marvelous blend of the ""old"" and the ""new""","Besides painting a satisfying portrait of ""upwardly mobile profesional black Americans,"" ""Boomerang"" is an appealing look at the oft-times amusing and tumultuous struggle between the sexes.

dvd,1 of 7,1.0,Boring ,Well if this movie had a story then I must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it. they don't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking (as one of the reviewer declared) about 2 people having sex.

dvd,5 of 5,4.0,A fascinating period piece,"This bleak, B&W film from 1950 was revolutionary in its time, but I have a bit of sympathy for those who might find it stylized and even a little pretentious today. What is truth?--surely a hard theme to tackle. Seems to me that whether the samurai was killed with a dagger or a sword could be easily determined--at least today. There would be fingerprints, etc. On the other hand, consider how much of the story depends on interpretation. Does the samurai really look at his wife with disgust after she is raped? After all, only she would really know--he doesn't say anything. Is she really fierce, as the bandit says, or weeping and weak as she appears in court? Was Kurosawa really poking fun at the genre with the clumsy fighting, or was he depicting stark reality for an audience that still romanticized ancient times? And is the ending really redemptive--I found myself wondering if the woodcutter would go off and sell the child if it was a girl. Even though Kurosawa intended it to be uplifting--note the shining sun--couldn't we wonder otherwise?"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Memorable,"I have no idea how many movies I've watched over the course of my life, but I do know that the vast majority of them have been totally forgettable. Not this one. When I watched this movie I had no idea who David Lynch was, and I had never seen any of his other films, so needless to say I was unprepared for his disjointed stream-of-consciousness style. I expected Mulholland Dr. to race along like countless other slick Hollywood movies, and instead it drifted along like a dream with occasional from-out-of-nowhere scares and some unexpected lesbian action. I became somewhat bored with this film when I realized that it had no  story, but it was a kind of disturbing boredom, like that experienced by anyone who closely follows American politics. The characters seemed engaging, but who were they, really? And what did they want, and why? No meaningful answers seemed forthcoming. Regardless, I wouldn't attempt to dissuade anyone from watching this movie. It's probably less insulting to your intelligence than the usual escapist fare, and if nothing else it will make you think about what makes a given series of events satisfying or unsatisfying; i.e., were the events themselves satisfying, or did we just come up with a nice story that made them seem coherent in retrospect? If memory alters reality, what is reality? What is the difference between individual reality and wikiality? and etc. Too much of that sort of thinking will give you a headache, though, so don't follow up your viewing of Mulholland Dr. with a novel by David Foster Wallace or anything like that"

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Basking in the Moonlight,"Part of the surprise for me in this series is how easy it was for me to write it off as yet another bishonen fantasy anime based on the previews.  Even if you do class it as an example of anime's cult of the beautiful, it stretches the definition of that genre just as Saiyuki does.  Stretching it to the point where defining it by the good looks of its main characters is folly.  Now that I've seen ten episodes I'm not sure if this is a 'genre' series at all, but it's certainly one of the best I've looked at in a while."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Jam Handy Was A Weird Guy,It's funny given what Jam Handy did with his life that he is not more famous than he is. He got olympic gold for the united states twice and was teh guy who perfected movie advertisements and later went on to help create television advertising. This documentary puts his life in perspective and makes the argument that marketing geniuses are the true backbone of the american way of life. I simply enjoyed seeing a biography of a person I knew little about beforehand.

dvd,4 of 11,1.0,"Read the original, see how terrible the movie is.","Who cares about the quality of the DVD with such a piece of mindless drivel.  I went out of my way to see this movie in the theatre, knowing it was based on Cornell Woolrich's noir masterpiece ""I Married a Dead Man""   This movie is the very antithesis of the work it was based on...a vile corruption of the dark, hopeless spiral into despair and miserable life-sucking unhappiness that was the original...(Imagine an Edgar Allen Poe tale recast with the Care Bears) Avoid this movie like the plague, yeccch! yeccch! yecch!  -- And besides the acting is terrible"

dvd,17 of 25,5.0,A classic example of reactive vs. proactive.,"As a youth I used to run home after school as well as awaken early Saturday mornings to enjoy this show about a ruthless villain hell-bent on terrorizing the world and the only organization strong enough to foil his plans daily.  To me it was the ultimate example of good vs. evil and no other program could top it.  It was the 80s, life was good and the G.I. Joes were the epitome of a young American boy's dream."
dvd,6 of 9,5.0,Poor maligned space bugs,"Roddy Piper, a top pro wrestler, happens to star in a movie classic.  I'd place this movie on my all time list of the 100 greatest movies ever made.  And it's carried by Roddy Piper.  He's not just the star.  He's the movie.  He, and the director, and the writer, and the costume designer.  He carries every single scene on his shoulders."

Well, you probably do, and well, if you're looking at this DVD in the first place, and you probably remember feeling angst one way or another about those days post-2000 election night.  Well, Greenwald doesn't attempt to spurn those feelings; instead, he shows why decisively on both sides of the aisle (but with an admittedly more anti-Republican focus), the 2000 election was a farcical debacle."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,"All I can say is ""WOW.""","I have been watching a variety of Anime over the last year or so since I finally got around to trying it out and deciding I like much of it-- ones that I've found to be truly great are RahXephon, BoogiePop Phantom, Gungrave, Cowboy Bebop, Ranma 1/2, FLCL and Evangelion.  Others that kept me entertained but were not  as mind-bending good that I've seen are Argento Soma, Betterman, Crest of the Stars, Inuyasha, El Hazard and 12 Kindoms.  I tend to prefer episodes to movies because I don't have to spend quite as much time focused on the TV-- I'm usually on the computer or doing other things at the same time.  But I've seen the movies Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke both of which were really great."
dvd,0 of 10,5.0,Re-Vamped Bond actor in one of the BEST Bond movies!,"For all the annoyance Roger Moore caused many Bond fans, he was still the face of Bond for 15 years, and became our comfortable successor to the role originally helmed by Connery.  Now that he FINALLY bowed out (after nearly decomposing in OCTOPUSSY and VIEW TO A KILL), the challenge was on to find the NEW James Bond.  Many hoped Pierce Brosnan would step into the role at this point, but alas he was still obligated to being Remington Steele on TV.  Somehow or other, Timothy Dalton got the role - a very odd choice indeed in that he never seemed to really even WANT the part!  Indeed, I would have to grudgingly argue that Dalton is my least favorite James Bond - he just never seemed to own the role the way his other peers did (even Lazenby in his ONE outing).  "
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,one of the best mob flicks,"This movie is chock full of stars. The one who is amazing is Tony Musante, Paulie's uncle. Take a look at a 1967 flick called the incident and he will show you what method acting is all about. His character in that flick is better than any in &quot;the POPE&quot; not to put down &quot;the POPE&quot; of course.  Too bad they gave him this small role, cauz he was the original bad boy. Anyway, the pope is awesome, Roberts and Rourke are incedible and the flick is a classic. DONT FORGET MUSANTE IN THE INCIDENT"
dvd,7 of 11,4.0,"Wal-Mart, The new slave owners!","Americans are ignorant, selectively blind, and in as much denial as a drug addict when it comes to cheaper prices at Wal-Mart.  After listening to the numerous negative news reports, I watched this DVD wondering what all the negativity was really about.  What an eye opener!!  I was addicted to Wal-Mart and spent more than a few thousand dollars there.  NO MORE!  I am shocked, but not surprised that Wal-Mart is a modern-day slave plantation...and of course, only in America is slavery still approved of under the guise of corporate profits and benefits to the consumer. Congress needs to do something about breaking up this company for its monopoly, soaking the welfare system, and for human rights violations.  Sure terrorism is important, but what about terroristic tactics of Wal-Mart?  Wake up Congress!"

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,One of the best ever,"Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it first in 1995 on video, I believe.  Never saw it or heard of it on the big screen.  Anyway, it's proof positive that a great directorial job, with actors (human and animal) who believe in a story about real human failings, lightheartedness and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life.  I had to see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as good as I thought. It deals with real suffering (including death, revenge, and anger) and then redemption.  Don't look for the classic happy ending, but an ending which is consistent with the themes in the movie and is very satisfying, after a little thought. The movie completely pulls you in (without your realizing it) and works its magic on your mind.  But, don't expect it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently throughout the movie, often unexplained at first.  ""Fluke"" also seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and compassionate toward my family, especially. I sort of got it the next day! And, you will love ""Fluke"", the dog! The movie is about a dog, but it's really about so much more. Even though the dog scenes are great, the subject matter at times is rather charged and there is violence and death (human and animal), so please be prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with you"
dvd,2 of 4,1.0,Explosions & Animal Crackers,"If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it's explosions.... big 'ol explosions. There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers. "
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,"""What is wrong with you, boy!""","The fifteen-year-old Duncan (Emile Hirsch) and his laconic father Edgar Mudge (Richard Jenkins) are reeling after the death of the most important person in their life. Duncan's mother and Edgar's wife died suddenly, whilst biking some farm eggs to her neighbor.  An alcoholic, she was the glue that tethered this family together, and her death has left Duncan and Edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss.  "
dvd,1 of 5,1.0,Would've given it nil stars if I could've...,"Dated, derivative, self-indulgent & unintelligent.  This is truly bottom of the range stuff.  The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire.  None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully.  I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).  Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Riddick is one bad mutha... SHUT YO MOUTH!,"This is a great sci-fi popcorn flick.  If you go in expecting Shakespeare, then you may be disappointed, but if you're looking for action and AWESOME special effects, with an interesting science fiction premise, then you'll be in heaven.  The HD-DVD looks great, and this movie is an awesome showcase for the fidelity of HD-DVDs"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,trip down memory lane,"I remember seeing kozmo logos all over the place a few years ago in a trip to NY, so when I saw this film it was a fantastic reminder of what one can do with a bit of luck and tons of hard work..or is it the other way around? "
dvd,,4.0,"Ah, Romance!","My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of ""healthy"" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story."
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,New Orleans is a Marvellous Environment for Coincidence,"As many reviewers note, New Orleans police drama ""The Big Easy"" exudes Cajun charm and Big Easy atmosphere enough to make you taste the Oyster Po'Boys and Chicory Coffee!  But the fabulous capture of local ambience is not in and of itself what makes this opus a tip-top choice for every DVD library."
dvd,,4.0,You don't throw away a whole life just 'cause he's banged up a little. ,"This is a very delightful film that is suitable for the whole family. True story of course, and very well told. Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper give shining performances. The story covers a lot of ground and therefore can get a little hard to understand at times, especially the beginning of the film. Once the groundwork has been laid, it gets pretty easy and will hold your attention all the way through. I personally had a little difficulty with the beginning. Once ""Seabiscuit"" comes into the movie, everything begins to click. Extroidinary acting by Maguire and even more so the young man who plays a very young Red Pollard before Maguire takes over the role. Very good cinematography, lush landscape, great sound technology. The DVD offers some good extras as well. A great film about second chances. I highly recommend it"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,On my top 5 list!,"Super funny, I could watch it over and over. It will be a classic."
dvd,,4.0,Not for little eyes...," This is another beautiful animated adventure by Hayao Miyazaki. Cons: I gave it four stars because it if definitely not for little eyes-heed the PG13 rating.   Princess Mononoke has a lot of bad language, violence, gore, and many adult themes-like the fact that the fighting girls come from a brothel.  When my 10 year old asked what that was, I realized this movie is for grown-ups.  It was not Hayao's usual adventure that brings a child far away into his or her imagination, and brings a grown person like me back to my childhood.  This film is dark and tortures the soul with a theme of humans once again killing what is innocent and beautiful for selfish reasons. Now for the Pros:  Hayao Miyazaki is a genius once again with his characters, animation, and theme.  Princess Mononoke is going to pull you in and make you fight for whichever side you choose, and not let you go until the very end.  Excellent for grown-ups who want to 'escape' the real world for a while, join forces with Hayao's good Asitaka & Mononoke or the evil Lady Eboshi characters, and fight for what they believe in.  A definite must for Anime lovers."

dvd,3 of 4,5.0,"A mature, intelligent love story....","This is why I love this film.  It's mature, intelligent, thoughtful, real, and in the end, sad and heartbreaking, but not despairing.  Some have expressed surprise that Eastwood directed this film so well, but I'm not.  Eastwood is a great handler of actors and has always displayed great sensitivity to them.  He never makes an actor read for a role, and he never says ""action"", because it makes actors nervous.  Despite a little too much sentimentality at the end, this film holds up very well, and is entirely believable.  Streep and Eastwood give phenomenal performances here, and you really believe that they are 2 souls that need each other.  The line ""certainty like this comes along once in a lifetime"" really haunts the film.  Rarely do you fall in love at first sight.  You may become infatuated at first sight, but love is a much deeper feeling.  Even though Streep and Eastwood's characters know each other for only 4 days, the rapport they have here is geniune and very honest.  It's a story for adults, and considering it was made in 1995 (when idiotic teen comedies were everywhere polluting the multiplexes), it's even more of a treasure.  Hollywood should do more adult romances, and not silly, vapid ""chick flicks"".  I don't like chick flicks, I prefer my romances to be more grounded in reality and intelligence, and this film is one of them..."
dvd,20 of 20,5.0,Very good workout :-),"This is the first 'for dummies' workout that I have bought and I really like it.  It's a good dvd if you haven't done a ball workout before.  You focus on stability and balance and building up your core strength.  But because you use weights too, you also get good toning for the whole body.  They use your regular overhead presses and ab work too.  She gives you optional moves if you want to make it harder or easier and tells you what not to do wrong.  "
dvd,2 of 14,1.0,Dead dolls don't play ,"Man I hate to get negative when it comes to bands as great as the dolls, who in there day were every bit as cool and influental as the press has reported.  This is really not the dolls though.  3 dead members and many years might make one skeptical and it should as this performance is uninspired, tired, and lifeless and a really bad idea and performance. If your an old fan you already know, and new fans looking for a glimpse of what made the dolls great had better keep looking. Crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy stuff!"

dvd,4 of 17,2.0,Great acting wasted on a poor script...,"I've dared to challenge my cinema-going art student friends and uni-mates, amid heated discussions about David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa and such, by confessing that I really didn't like Magnolia at all.  I feel that PT Anderson does indeed create well-rounded characters, compelling dialogue and stuff like that.  The actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances - but in the end, I really felt Magnolia fell short of something more substantial.  It dragged on way too long, the extensive scenes never really seemed to go anywhere and I felt that some serious revisions and editing would have been most beneficial.  There were twists and diversions that didn't really add anything and overall I felt like it was a waste of time which is a shame because some of the scenes featured some great and inspiring acting but maybe they were misplaced.  It didn't really have the sort of message that I couldn't have gotten from a song or another movie in less time and all the symbollic, arty stuff came across as pretentious film-student stuff.  I think PT Anderson is highly overrated as a director and his films are way too self-indulgent.  I don't think he's very good at telling a story without going overboard and sending the viewer astray.  With the exception of the performances by Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise, I thought this film was terrible"
dvd,,5.0,beware amazon credits for classic crime DVD,"Five stars to typically wondrous production values, though THE HOLLOW pales in comparison to the non-crime-novel intricacy of FIVE LITTLE PIGS."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Ol'  Rock-Fish' Returns in Style ,"Last year TV Guide called The Rockford Files the greatest detective series ever.  Tall order that, considering all the detective shows in the history of American television.  I, for one, think such praise is truly deserved.  What sets this series apart, I believe, is the tone set by its leading man, James Garner.  You can just sit back and relax in knowing that Jim Rockford will solve the case in his own personal self-deprecating style.  You can count on at least one car chase, a fist fight or two, and a healthy dose of 'tongue in cheek' humor.  The show never takes itself too seriously, and that's a plus.  Great characters abound, from Rocky to Beth, Angel to Dennis, all built around the only actor that could've pulled off the lead role with charisma to spare.  Like Jack Klugman with 'Quincy' or Peter Falk's Lt Columbo, only Mister Garner could pull off Jim Rockford and make it work.  "
dvd,,5.0,A Fine Piece of Filmmaking,"Most film critics (from reviews I've read) name one of three films as their favorite Woody Allen movie. Those titles are (usually) Annie Hall, The Purple Rose of Cairo, or Manhattan. While ""Annie Hall"" is the only one of those films to make The American Film Institute's Top 100 (the regular 100 and the comedies), Manhattan does hold a spot on A.F.I's Top 100 Comedies (#46). Allen directs, co-writes, and stars in ""Manhattan"" as Isaac;A 42-year old man who's wife (Meryl Streep) has left him for another woman, is writing a book about their troubled marriage. And he happens to be in a relationship with a 17 year old girl named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway, who recieved an Oscar nomination). While her age very much surrounds the subject of the film, it's never made into a moral issue. Tracy and Isaac seem a bit mismatched, not just because of the age difference...Also, Tracy is genuinely in love with Isaac. Isaac sees it as a fling. Meanwhile, Isaac's friend Yale (Michael Murphy) is having an affair with Mary (Diane Keaton)...Who Isaac has found himself falling in love with. Allen takes a big risk in this film, because in one aspect...The film doesn't really know what it wants to be. For most films, that would mean failure. Allen lets it fall between the cracks. Go to a few different videostores. You'll sometimes find this in the ""Comedy"" section and other times in the ""Drama"" section. The film is a romantic comedy, but it's deeper than that as well. Allen's dialogue (which is always good) is particularly good in the conversations between Isaac and Mary; The final scene between Isaac and Tracy is also very meaningful and very good. The movie is filmed in black & white, which seems perfect for this material. After watching the film, I read Roger Ebert's critique of it in his book ""The Great Movies"" (it's the only Allen film listed in that book, Annie Hall is in his The Great Movies II). At the end he mention, I'm paraphrasing, that people say Allen always plays the same character in his movies. He goes onto say (and I quote) that in the final scene, ""[Allen finds] the precise tone of a man who desires and regreats and yet actually does like this young woman enough to know she's doing the right thing."" Watching the movie again, I realize that he was absolutely right. In any film Woody Allen stars in, he plays an overly neurotic guy...He usually uses the same mannerisms and speaks the same way, but in each film he's in there's something different. Look at it as he's playing his previous character's twin brother. This is a marvelous film, great on so many levels."
dvd,2 of 6,5.0,Hilarious!!!,"This is my all time favorite funny movie. I must have seen it about 50 times, and it hasn't gotten a bit old.  I laugh so hard I cry.  This isn't slapstick humor, it is suddle and that's what makes it so great"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Russian Comedy at its best,"This movie is hilarious. A ""modern"" Soviet scientist builds a time machine and mistakenly ends up in Ivan the Terrible's palace...  and he is transported to the USSR! The premise itself is enough to make you laugh...  but the hilarity that follows is indescribable! "
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,A Different Kind Of What's Happening!!!!,"     As on 'Good Times',this show went through a major transition in it's final season.Mother Mabel King left the show as Raj and Rerun moved in as roommates,with the occational (and all too often irritating) presence of Dwayne.If one can criticize this season for anything it was that it tried a little too hard for laughs.ReRun gets a job at CBS in one and the characters are put into other sitcom situations.But I could have done without seeing Dwayne dolled up as Chrissy from 'Three's Company'.As usual most of the best comic situations come from Shirley and ReRun,although in retrospect ReRun sometimes comes off as idiotic and more then a little coniving.Dee is the big change over-her basic television personality hasn't changed but her energy and smart aleck ways were toned down alot this season AND her hairstyle changed too much.And her nose for figures are played up alot more.Still the laughs come.My favorite is the final episode revolving a benifit concert held by the cast-ReRun promises he can get Sammy Davis Jr. to appear but when he fails he has to eat crow.What's funny is when Raj and Dee sing,Dwyane plays drums and Shirley COMMANDS attention with a single shake of a finger.Maybe it wasn't an ending per se since the show did return six years later as ""What's Happening Now!!"" but I think this first series lasted exactly as long as it should have"

So since he was the director of this anime everything about this anime relates to him. Some people look too much into this anime and expect it to be religious and have insight to their own lives. However FLCL has nothing at all to do with religion. When you see the hand (which is Mr.Tsurumaki's hand, just animated) it signifies nothing but one of Tsurumaki's ideas. So put simply he wanted a giant hand with an old fashioned iron, and that's exactly what he got. "

dvd,8 of 10,2.0,"poor quality piece, but...","i was extremely disappointed with this dvd, in both content and quality. "
dvd,,1.0,Waste of time and money,"Considering the director's track-record, the high quality of the original movie (The Poseidon Adventure) and the budget available for making this remake, I found Poseidon to be an absolutely awful and uninteresting movie and a complete waste of time and money. I give it 1 star because I cannot go any lower than that. I read the reviews before watching it, so I was prepared for the worst, but it was even worse than I expected. Let's keep in mind we're talking about a film that is supposed to be a blockbuster movie here, not a mere TV-film. The only positive thing I have to say about it, is that it is mercifully short. While watching it on DVD, I barely overcame the urge to fast-forward certain scenes. The plot has holes so big an oceanliner the size of Titanic could sail through them and still have room to maneuver. There is no introduction, no explanation whatsoever as to where the ship is going, who the people are, what caused the monster-wave, etc. Calling the main characters two- instead of three-dimensional is giving them too much credit. You don't care at all whether they survive or die, the only exception perhaps being the little boy. The CGI effects aren't all that great either. I never knew so much things could explode on a partially submerged ocean-liner (a typical and, to me, illogical and extremely irritating Hollywood trademark). The movie really is no more than a boring and repetitious series of clims and crawls through poorly lit and generally burning areas. The water is supposed to be cold and salt, but that doesn't show, even for a second. Although they are just (first-time) passengers, the people involved know their way around the vessel remarkably well (even though it is turned upside down)and have an uncanny knowledge about its inner workings and where to go for escape. They know exactly which hatch or stairwell to take and which button to push, even scared and exhausted in the dark and underwater. Ever been inside a large ship or ferry boat yourself ? You don't know which end is which or where to go if your life depends on it. At the end of the movie, the survivors reach daylight and: lo and behold: there's just one piece of wreckage afloat and it is an inflated life-raft, conveniently located near the bow-thrusters. In typical Hollywood tradition, the ship sinks bare seconds after the survivors have climbed inside the raft. Mr Petersen's Poseidon project should have sunk well before he got started. A seriously uncool movie that is insulting even to people who are looking for 1,5 hours of brainless entertainment."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Passion Exists,"This DVD is not for anyone expecting muscial performances.  It is a history class about someone who contributed to the blues revolution.  Antone's shows clips on virtually every important blues act of the day.  It is informative and educational. While music was going thru its transition of disco, glam, and metal Antone was creating a foundation of the blues movement.  It is an informal documentary that is pleasing.  Now that we know tapes of and young Stevie Ray exists, please release them!!!!!!!!!!!!!. "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A Movie Worth Buying,"I will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot. The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this. If you like it the first time you see it, then proceed to buy it, because you always will. If you're not keen on it, then don't bother"

dvd,,4.0,Cry for the missing song,"The series kind of changed direction near the end of the first season. Season 2 continues that change by concentrating a little more on sci-fi elements. Overall this is still a strong season, but I think the move worked to the shoe's detriment. And there are a couple of really weak episodes here, especially ""Meet the Dupes"" and ""Max in the City"". Yikes! On the other hand, there are some great ones, too, particularly ""The End of the World,"" ""A Roswell Christmas Carol,"" and ""Cry Your Name."""
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Fun Christmas Movie for the Family! ,"Although there is a few crude moments in the movie, which may be questionable for chidren, overall it is a fairly fun and enjoyable Christmas movie for the family.

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,In her hair she wore a yellow ribbon/ she wore it for her lover/ who was in the cavalry ,"Often a review for me is an opportunity to learn about a book, a movie, a piece of music that I had experience of in the past and have fragmented , incomplete memories of and certain questions about. For instance what I most remember about this film is the song, 'She wore a yellow ribbon' and with it a strange kind of mysterious feeling.

So I spent my money and here is my opinion of GOOD ADVICE."
dvd,0 of 9,1.0,Buy the Original Cast (1953) Instead,"IMHO, none of the cast could hold a candle to the original with Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, etc.  These shows are all about the music - if the music doesn't make it, the whole production isn't worth two cents. "

It sounded like it was from a child. No way would an older woman's voice sounds like that. I like it how Devon's character has to understand his new and emerging feelings, and realize that he's not the only one that feels that way. It's nice to know that his soon to be ex-girlfriend is the understanding type. She's even involved in the end when it comes to uncovering the truth about Devon's step-dad. That's a true friend. "

dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Boring and Stupid,"OK. This is the Tobe Hooper movie following ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The script was co-written by TCM writer Kim Henkel. The movie features a good cover and a good synopsis on the back. So, where does this film go wrong? Where doesn't it? I want to start off that it's obvious that Quentin Tarantino has seen this movie because the opening scene's dialouge was used in ""Kill Bill Vo.1"". My name is Buck and I'm here to f**k. In the beginning we're introduced to a hooker who refuses to have sex with Buck (a very young pre-Freddy Krueger, Robert Englund) and is kicked out of the whorehouse in which she resides. She ends up at the Starlight Motel, a dark motel hidden in the depths of the Bayou. In a horror movie made in today's times, this would be the part where you would turn the film off. Anyone who has seen a horror mvoie should know that this is not the kind of motel you walk into. The Starlight is kept by Judd (a very creepy Neville Brand) who acts sane and then suddenly the exact opposite and ends up killing the hooker. Oddly enough, living right next to the motel is Judd's alligator, hence the title ""Eaten Alive"". The movie continues with a few other people who pass through, including a family of 3. The father is killed, the mother is tied to the bed, and the young daughter hides from Judd beneath the house. Then the family of the hooker show. Oh and Buck shows up and Judd shows an odd distaste in him immediately. This movie should've been good and it definitley had the makings for a good horror movies. The 70's was arguably the decade for horror films. Looking at horror movies nowadays there is clear inspiration from 70's horror movies. This movie has a grainy look to it, there's blood galore, and it's pretty disturbing. Brand is one of the best horror film heavies ever, but he's not anywhere near as creepy as the infamous Leatherface. ""Eaten Alive"" was inspired and a lot of hardcore horror fans will enjoy it. I love horror films and the more graphic they are, the better. This movie just lagged though. In between the scenes when Judd was killing people, it was just really boring. It was cool seeing Robert Englund, who as a kid looked nothing like Freddy Krueger. And the film also stars Marilyn Burns, the actress who escaped in TCM and made a cameo appearance as the Anonymous Woman at the end of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"". I'd recommend another horror film, but if it sounds good to you. Go for it."
dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Waste of Popcorn,"I saw this movie at the cinema. Having enjoyed other Hugh Grant flicks, I didn't expect this movie to be the total stinker it turned out to be. I thought Grant and Jeanne Triplehorn were a mis-matched couple. The acting was so-so, the plot very thin, and the humour strained. Overall, this movie wasn't worth the price we paid to see it, and I have no desire to ever watch it again"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,AMAZON,"Actually, I would like to express my disappointment in your communications.  When I first inquired about this DVD, you told me that it was not yet published but if I desired, I would be put on a list to be contacted when it was published.  I was not contacted and read in a magazine that this movie was available on DVD.  Why did you ask me if you weren't planning on contacting me????  I had been waiting for this and as you can see, I purchased several copies for gifts.  From now on, if you don't plan on following through on things, don't ask your customers if they want things"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Heartwarming Love story,"If I could make one change to this movie, it would be near the end when Angel (Isaac Hayes) tells what happened to each of the characters...I would have added a brief cameo of Muriel (played brilliantly by Rosie Perez) getting her just desserts...I would show Muriel, working in a nail salon, with a bitter look on her face, slamming things around, with a rude customer barking orders at her.  Other than that, great movie!"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,The Eye 2,"This was a good horror movie.  It was much better than the first.  The first movie was slow paced and boring.  The shocking moment of the first movie was silly and i was able to predict it.  In this movie i dont think the plot was the best horror plot ive ever seen but it was interesting.  Shu Qi was a great choice in this movie.  Unlike the actress in the first movie, Shu Qi was not so wooden.  I was shocked that the actress in the first won a award because it made me laugh how fake her crying was in the first eye.  But i did feel Shu Qi's characters pain in this movie and that is the entire reason im giving this movie a 5 star: because of character development.  also this movie is much more scary than the first.  In the first 'eye' i was not scared one time.  It was all perdictable scares.  In this movie i actually got scared because there were times that what i thought was going to happen didnt happen, something else happened instead and that added a fun factor to this movie.  I would say that although not the best horror movie, this one is much better than the first"
dvd,1 of 4,2.0,"Pretty, pretty, pretty, lame.","You know, I used to like Renny Harlin's films when I was younger, but they really don't hold up, I've realized with my coming of age. I think he's a talented director capable of some genuinely biting action scenes ('Cliffhanger', 'Die Hard 2'), but overall his films are messy, and, if I'm to be scholarly in articulating the matter, stupid. "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Surprise!,"I had no idea what this film was going to be about.  It turned out to be quite thought provoking and a stupendous love story.  I wont retell the plot because everyone else has done that.  The characters and the acting were superb.  In the beginning, the small town lawyer wife thinks she's quite a  tough-guy.  That's her personna so when the carpet is pulled out from beneath her she is totally destroyed and has to re-think her concept of herself.  So does the son.   They all must.. except the angelic small daughter who welcomes dad back without a blink of an eyelash.  This film is quite a love story despite the incredible amount of violence. Did the son inherit a fight-to-kill gene from his dad I wonder?  William Hurt gives an  distractingly accurate impersonation of someone from northeast Philadelphia but in my opinion, Ed Harris sounded like he was from the Bronx. "

dvd,7 of 7,5.0,"""Ambition makes the man...""","In this 1957 film directed by Akira Kurosawa, Lord Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Lord Miki (Akira Kubo) encounter a spirit in a maze-like forest that prophesies great things for the two comrades: the former will someday rule the imposing Spider's Web Castle and the latter will take his friend's position as commander of the First Fortress. Even beyond that, the spirit predicts that Miki's son will one day succeed Washizu as the master of Spider's Web Castle. Although the two men are initially reluctant to trust the spirit's words, preliminary parts of the prophecy come to pass, thus setting into motion a bloody chain of events that explores the differences between active and passive destiny. Lady Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), Washizu's scheming wife, prods her husband to seize the reigns of power at any cost. She insists that Washizu's only restraint is his own ambition and that heaven itself had preordained his rise."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great Tribute For A Great Athlete ,"I think it's a great film for all basketball fans -- novice and Thompson/ABA fans alike. It is one of the few sports documentaries that maintains focus on an athlete's achievements and contributions on the court, instead of accentuating an athletes off-court personal struggles, tribulations, and in Thompson's case; redemption.

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Unexpected Gem,"This turned out to have been written by the author who wrote The Graduate.  It is a funny movie and Colin Firth is great as always, Heather Graham was at times annoying and I kept thinking she's too young.  Minnie Driver was ok and in an unexpected comic turn.  However, Frank Collison and Mary Steenburgen absolutely  steal the movie - they are so funny and their comic timing is impeccable.  Even the man in my life laughed at some of the antics Firth & Graham got up to especially the driving scene.  It's clever and very witty"

Julia Roberts plays a women named Maggie Carpenter who gets engaged to four men and runs away before she says ""I do"".

If you don't have this movie you should get it now"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Strikingly Original,"While the ""package"" advertised appears to simply be a set of already released dvds with no added material the uninitiated would be well advised to just buy them all now (besides, the dvds already contain episode commentaries for every show plus other fun bits).  This is one of the most adventurous and original sketch comedy programs every produced and, while not every show is a success, you have to appreciate the risks they were willing to take.  When things did work, few shows could compare.  If you do chose to purchase one season at a time, my suggestion would be to buy 3 first.  This seemed like the most consistent to me although others are sure to disagree"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Great horror classics preserved in hard digital media,"Although I had about half of these movies from collections I bought from DVD bargain bins, the price was very reasonable to justify getting about 25 new horror classics added to my collection."
dvd,,5.0,The General's Daughter,"A taut, well made thriller with a lot of nuance and details that make seeing it a second or third time equally enjoyable. Strong acting keeps one's attention to the flow of the story. The glimpse into military politics is also illuminating. And it's one of the best movie scores I've heard in a long time. It's nice to hear that blend of music anywhere these days"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Black comedy that shines,"	We hadn't seen Charlie Chaplin in the shoes of the Little Tramp since 1940's The Great Dictator, nor would we again. With the advent of talkies in the late twenties, he went through some difficult changes as modes of production and expectations among audiences grew more and more sophisticated; he said that movies needed sound as much as Beethoven's symphonies needed words, and not surprisingly, his output diminished. But when he did decide to make a movie every other three or four years, such as City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), or his masterpiece, The Great Dictator, they garnered for him terrific financial and critical rewards. Monsieur Verdoux was a flop. By the time it had come out in 1947, Chaplin had been accused in a paternity suit, suspected of being a Communist sympathizer, and in about six years he would leave the country almost for good. It is against this background of increasing paranoia and the beginnings of the Cold War that he shot his darkest comedy. "
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Excellent representation of the times,"I've now seen both the Kultur and Mosfilm versions of this film, and the wide-screen Mosfilm version is clearly better. The scenes of battle give one the impression of the sheer scale of the Napoleonic battles. As a representation of the book Bondarchuk's version gives me a better understanding of Tolstoy's work than the Hollywood version. The reason why I deducted 1 star was the habit of the director to show loads of riderless horses to represent the chaos of battle, he did a similar thing in ""Waterloo"". But apart from that, his depiction of the Napoleonic tactics was very good. The uniforms were excellent, no evidence of cardboard and staples as can be seen in ""Waterloo"". The relationship between Kutusov and Czar Alexander was brilliantly portrayed, particularly in their discussion at Austerlitz (they disliked each other). It also depicts the intrigues that went on behind and between the Russian generals, who were very good at exaggerating their battles. In this though I feel that Tolstoy himself is a little guilty: the battle of Borodino, while a very important battle, was depicted as more than it really was. A relation: Count Ostermann-Tolstoi commanded the centre-right wing of the army"

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,James Cagney makes publicity for J: Edgar  Hoover...,"...And enjoys every minute. The film begins when Brick Davis (James Cagney) an idealistic but unsuccessful lawyer bows out a mother-beating crook. He refuses to become a shyster but respectable clients rarely show up in his Eastside-office. When one of his friends, a new-fledged G-man is killed during an arrest he decides to join the FBI. Cagney's patron McKay, a basically good racketeer who invested $20.000 in his college-education, agrees with his decision. He too plans to leave the mob (""It does not pay. It brings just money""). His decision infuriates his two underlings : Leggett (a posh gangster with bowler & gardenia) and Collins ( Barton McLane, who never read  Emily Post - but his co-stars liked him a lot). Leggett and Collins warn Cagney not to poke his nose into their affairs - it goes without  saying that he spends the rest of the film hunting these Dillinger-clones down. They rob banks in passing, stage a railway massacre and butcher officers with their machine-guns."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A Good Old-fashioned Bellylaugh,"I just loved this movie.  It was fun watching the usually suave Cary Grant become befuddled and half crazed when he discovers his two dear sweet old aunts have been very, very naughty. Between ""Teddy Roosevelt"" charging up the stairs blowing his bugle and digging the Panama Canal in the basement....his evil cousin (Raymond Massey) and his evil cousin's sidekick, Dr. Einstein (played by Peter Lorre) you almost overlook the elderberry wine - but take my word for it...you shouldn't. ;-) "

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Thank God for a  movie about Thanksgiving.,"Pieces of April is such a sweet, lovely, and heartfelt movie. Katie Holmes is pitch-perfect as the title character April. This is her best film, she is flawless and unforgettable. She is the dark horse of her family, she has never had a solid relationship with her mother who is now dying of breast cancer. Her mother is played by Patricia Clarkson (oscar-nominated role),her character is cruel, moody, and trying her hardest to make amends with her rebellious daughter. April invites her family to her apartment for a ""nice"" Thanksgiving dinner, things go array when April discovers her oven is not working. This film is only an 1 hour and 12 minutes long and I think this movie is perfectly fine in length. Pieces of April is a very intelligent indie film, forget about her work on Dawson's Creek, Holmes is a true and talented actress here"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,You will be hooked!,"As stated by another reviewer, don't get this series unless you are willing to spend plenty of time watching it.  You will be ""addicted"" to it.  And you will continue watching the next show because each episode leaves you hanging!  My wife and I rented season one from Blockbuster and returned every night to get the next disk, and the next as soon as we finished one set.  We had an ""Aliasthon"" and finished all three seasons in 2 weeks.  My boys purchased seasons 1, 2, and 3 for my birthday and now they are watching the series themselves.  It is a great sci-fi show that my wife and I look forward to watching weekly.  Having all 3 seasons enables us to go over the shows again slowly.  We covered so much in 2 weeks that we can now take our time watching each episode and catch the minor details and nuances.  Of course, having the series also enables each of us to watch our favorite episodes again and again.  I will purchase season 4 when it comes out."

I thought it was hilarios in the beginning when Frank, Norbert, and Ed got in a gunfight with those gangsters on the staircase and out of nowhwere, a lawnmower comes down the stairs.  It's those kind of random sight gags that i love seeing and i can never get enough of that.  David and Jerry Zucker are really successful comedy producers and hope they make more movies with people such as Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges"

For instance, I think Nemesis, is horrible.  But then I hear people saying this is a horrible movie.  I have to disagree, this movie is great."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Feel-Good Movie,"This is one of the best movies out there, and in my opinion one of the most unheard of and under-rated movies. The characters are very well developed and outlandish from the eccentricly outgoing berry(Jack Black) to the quiet weird geek type Dick. John Cusack plays his sort of loserish, bad ass, role model and tell his journey with women ever since he could remeber having interest in the opposite sex. This is an amazing story of one man's struggle to overcome the opposite sex."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A brilliant script gives a romantic story resonance.,"I have always loved Daphne DuMaurier's story and remembered the beauty of the original film's art direction which won an Oscar. However, I could never get through the book and found Joan Fontaine's arched acting a little hard to take. So, when I discovered this Masterpiece Theatre version, I ordered it immediately and have grown to really admire the writing which places the romantic story into its historical period and fashions Dona St. Colombe and her pirate captain into real in-depth, flesh and blood characters. Bravo to Masterpiece Theatre"
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Film-Noir at It's Best,"Film-noir is hard to do. Film-noir isn't about plot; It's about mood, tone, and look. When it was originated in the 40s, it was all very well done by directors who didn't know they were making ""noir."" Now that directors actually set out to do that, it usually doesn't succeed. In ""Body Heat,"" the directorial debut of Lawrence Kasdan and the screen debut of Kathleen Turner, he crafts noir in a 40s-ish way but never fails to remind you in almost every scene that the film takes place in the 1980s. William Hurt, in his second film (just a year or two before he'd win an Oscar for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"") plays a lawyer named Ned Racine. Ned lives in Florida (where a heat wave seems to be occuring), is lazy and cocky and has a way with women. Then he meets Matty (Turner), a married woman that manages to exert sexiness with her clothes on rarely seen since Marilyn Monroe died. Ned and Matty being a passionate love affair, but soon Matty explains that her husband needs to die."

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Good Product...,"Rating something like this is a rather difficult assignment since a lot depends on what is expected of it. I successfully used this package to make a marked improvement in the picture quality of my 1985 model Quasar console TV. I will have a high-def set in the very near future and will use this package to adjust it as well. It is because of the improvement in my Quasar that I have given four stars...yet there are some things to consider. When using the filters, the display may not exactly match what the instructions say it should be. Admittedly, this could have been due to the older set I was working with; but it may also be a fact of life for all sets. Expect to make some subjective decisions. This is really the point all the way through the process....most everything you do will be the result of your own perception of what you see and think you see.

Jillian specifically has someone doing a modified easier version so whenever I was getting really tired I followed what that person was doing instead.
dvd,0 of 5,5.0,Twentieth Century,"One of the great early screwball comedies, and an opportunity to see Barrymore in his funniest performance as the desperate, histrionic Jaffe.  As Lily, Lombard is leading lady gorgeous, but also possesses unmatched comic flair.  The screenplay, by partners Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht, moves as fast as that train.  Get on-board"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,An essential tool for any home theater,"This Disc has a pretty steep learning curve but if the explanation is  followed carefully it is very useful, the explanation of video and audio terminolgies is clear and precise and most importantly the test tones included on this disc are very valuable for those who the best out of their HT system."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Enter The Legend,"Movies are of course best viewed uncut and preferably in a movie theatre. The next best thing is seeing it at home on a really good home theatre system.  And that goes double for an action film.  In any case, Enter The Dragon is the ultimate marital arts film and remains the ultimate showcase for the legend that is Bruce Lee."
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,a tub of liquid satan,"The set-up could be ludicrous: a tub of liquid Satan is discovered in an old church in LA and a group of college students, led by their physics prof, attempt to stop it from escaping into the world and bringing about the Apocalypse. "
dvd,1 of 5,4.0,Four Weddings & A Funeral updated,"This is a delightful little film that owes more than a passing nod to Richard Curtis' films like Four Weddings and Love Actually. There's even Matthew Goode doing his best faux-Hugh Grant impersonation, which some may find just a little irritating because it suggests the real thing but lacks Grant's range as an actor.  This lack of depth means we never sympathise quite as much as we should with his predicament, namely that the woman he loves is in love with another woman. "
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"Fun, light comedy Movie ",Jennifer Love Hewitt will probably never look hotter than she is in this movie. Wow!! Her character katya is an ad exec for a major advertising firm. She basically exhibits behavior reflective of a sociopath through the movie. It's fun to watch her demean people and step on or walk over people to get to the top. The movie centers around katya trying to get an invitation to a big party at the same time trying to find the man of her dreams.

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Good movie but get out the kleenex.,"In the old days this movie would have been called a ""chick flick"".  Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC.

Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother.  One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years"
dvd,0 of 8,5.0,I WAS excited....but now I'm just angry,"I made a big mistake in purchasing this dvd.  I thought it would be good to commemorate such a famous broadway musical by buying the commemorative edition dvd.  Well, unbeknownst to me, this musical was a big flying turd.  A big old airborne meatsicle of poopy turds.  Granted I don't like musicals, animals OR broadway, but I thought this would be worth a shot.  Well, the only thing getting a shot NOW is me....cause I need 30 CC's of Uncrapulator to get this crapfest out of my brain.  There is so much poop in my brain now that it's hard to know the difference between when I'm thinking and when the poo is just shifting around.  I have to keep my head completely still, or else my ears fart and it's totally embarassing.  Thanks SO MUCH, Cats the Musical (Commemorative Edition)...you have ruined my life."

Get a dose of Robin Williams' outstanding comic yet brilliant acting for this Barry Levinson film about the era when war torn out Vietnam. I have seen this fil for four times already and I could say that this movie truly capitulates the importance of humor in the middle of tense and severe situation. Yeah, we all know that we shouldn't take this situation as funny but hey, life isn't all about struggle...humor lightens it"

Unfortunately I can't stand wrestling after the late 80's. Unknown fact until now: I was sitting in the front row of Wrestlemania 3. You can actually see me a few times (mostly the back of my head). Anyway, I was there and I actually got a momento from the event. It was a lock of hair from the adorable Adrian Adonis. When Brutus Beefcake cut his hair, Piper threw some of Adrian's hair into the stands. There was this big lock of his hair and I outwrestled some pimple faced 12 year old for it. I still have it. With all the money I spend on my daily medications, I'm thinking of selling on some auction site"

dvd,13 of 18,5.0,A highly talented pianist who will continue to develop and impress!,"Of the two extant DVDs that feature Yundi Li, this one is the best. Li's playing of the four Chopin Scherzi was enjoyable. He really impressed me as a young up and coming pianist. One can see that Li has grown incredibly as a pianist in only four years if one compares Li's playing on this DVD to his already noteworthy playing at the 14th International Chopin Competition when Li was only 18.  I look forward to seeing Li, and a number of other talented young pianists (e.g. Arcadi Volodos, who is perhaps the most extraordinary new pianist out there today) develop their talents and continue to please.  The extras on this DVD were fun. There are video promotions similar to MTV videos featuring Yundi Li as a heart throb. More importantly, the DVD comes with a bonus of Li playing a movement of the Chopin Concerto No. 1 in Warsaw at the International Competition -- a real bonus!"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,I saw this twice.,"I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice.  It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock  a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out.  The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie.  Everyone else does a great job of acting here.  To me though, Tom is miscasted.  He seems to be out of place.  His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do.  Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned.  Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well.  A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here"

dvd,2 of 2,4.0,You don't know how good you have it until it's gone,"This was a chick flick in many respects, but not so sappy and irrational that it annoys you like other chick flicks do.  All three leads are legitimately angry and the audience feels for them, because we've all been scorned (whether you're a man or a woman, but it will obviously speak to you moreso if you are a woman).  I wouldn't give this 4 stars because the song and dance routines were lame and kind of annoying. "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Hilarious,"Two people made this moving hilarious:  Zaboo and Vince Vaughn.  Although I'm a huge Travolta fan, these two supporting characters kept me in stitches.  Cedric the Entertainer also added to the success of this movie."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A classic,"If you loved this movie, try 50 First Dates.  The surprising chemisty from Drew and Adam continues in that movie.  I love the humor and the 80s clothes!! :-"
dvd,16 of 31,4.0,Better than season 1...still not as good as the orginal CSI,The thing that strikes me the most about the CSI series' is that each one has a distinctly different feel to it.  CSI is more technical and intellectual.  CSI Miami is sexy and fast.  CSI NYC is gritty and methodical.  The differences keep them all fresh.  They also set themselves up for different tastes.
dvd,11 of 14,4.0,Review for 3 Disc Extended Edition,"The biggest problem most people had with King Kong was its length, so there's no surprise that reaction by the general public to the release of an extended edition of another 3 hour-plus Peter Jackson film was almost the equivalent of a collective groan."
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Leave your mind at the door.....this is funny stuff!,"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.....do wa do wa do wa do wa do wa! This film has got swing! It's funny! Not because of Robin Williams. In fact it's funny in spite of him! He comes off as annoying and abraisive. Likewise the same can be said of Peter O'Toole who is forgettable as the English patron who tries to act as the local lush who Williams seems to want to place on a Royal pedastil for some unexplained reason. The result is nausiating. The real laughs are left to the Second City Remnants of Rick Morranis and Eugene Levy who are perfect as the undertanned, unhip, nerdy meat packers who try and try to score with chicks and the results are exactly what you'd expect.....zero! But the real heap of praise has to go to Andrea Martin who steals the show as the house wife who throws her years of repression into the wind and lets out the inner freebird that she has held in check all her life. She is brilliant in the role and the entire movie is saved by her scene chewing performance. Get this movie just to see her. It's one you'll want to watch over and over again. Buy it!"
dvd,14 of 14,5.0,"Pasty Midwesterners are people, too.","""And so my course is clear: to go through life pretending to have done and seen things that have hardened me -- made me aloof and unreachable.  Which works, until I need to ask a stock boy where they keep their corn meal.  Then the facade crumbles, and it's clear that I'm not a weathered loner who's seen too much; just a pasty Midwesterner who can't find the flour aisle.""  "

dvd,0 of 3,2.0,Meh,"The meta-story of this film was potentially interesting, but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable. "
dvd,4 of 7,4.0,What to do with that ten bucks,"Obviously, the person that suggested saving your ten bucks was reviewing the film according to the Sophranos.  This isn't the Sophranos.  This is an independent film that doesn't even have a quarter of the production money the Showtime series has -- and it turned out great!  The actors and actresses in this film brought the characters to life, gave them a demension that people that literally live near Hellgate Bridge can relate to.  They were real, not the flashy hollywood glamour characters that would have ruined this film.  I say buy this film and some popcorn with that ten bucks and watch it just for it's entertainment value, not comparing it to another show :"
dvd,,4.0,Exploitation Movie,"One reason Wild Things works so well is that director John McNaughton sustains a darkly comic tone throughout the film without letting it degenerate into farce.He also drenches Wild Things with sex as moist and steamy as the town's surrounding marshes.Wild Things is far too smart to be called sexist, and all the skin on display heightens the sultry, festering atmosphere. Sure it's an exploitation movie, but this twisted Technicolororgy is also a thriller in the original sense of that word.It's like a three-way collision between a softcore sex film, a soap opera and a B-grade noir. I liked it"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,The Best Drama Series - Hands Down,"'Once and Again' represented to me the highest point in television drama. This more-than-memorable series was no doubt one of the best to ever grace the airwaves.  Fine acting, brilliant writing, exceptional direction and noteworthy plotlines were the consistent standard for this series.  Not only did it excel in the heretofore mentioned categories, but it also broke some barriers for what television could do with a drama series.  Intimacy, nudity, sexuality, and other sometimes taboo subjects were handled with truth and honesty.  Deep character development was the standard not the exception...even for characters that had more peripheral roles.  The series was genuine.  I never felt a false moment.  I was heartbroken to see it end after 3 brief years.  Apparently mainstream Americans found this degree of depth in a television series too much to handle after a long day at work (or perhaps after 9/11)...or perhaps ABC did not promote it in a proper timeslot.  Regardless, My only solace remains that I can now revisit it from time to time thanks to the release of the series via DVD. "
dvd,,5.0,Finally- a Documentary about White Collar Crime,"This is an excellent portrayal of the Enron fiasco. It utilizes footage and sound bites, and interviews, it's absolutely amazing what happened! This film is a must see for everyone"
dvd,,5.0,Post Modern post College Comedy,"There's been a lot of talk recently about Noah Baumbach given the praise he received for The Squid and the Whale. I was searching for his second feature, Mr. Jealousy (incidently on order), when I saw that Criterion had released a new edition of his cult favorite Kicking and Screaming. It's a film I saw when it was originally released and immediately identified with. I think it is a common rite of passage for liberal arts majors to spend sometime after graduation spinning their wheels as they try to decide what to do with their lives, which is basically what this film is about. The details of these four characters who are in arrested development mirrors that of my post graduate roommates and myself. I think it is the start of a process in which your naive illusions of life are lost or shattered."
dvd,,5.0,THE PERFECT RELEASE FOR A PERFECT MOVIE,"The extras, the transference, the sound everything on this dvd is awesome a must have for any David Lynch fan"
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,Another Great Giallo From Dario Argento!,"The second film of the animal trilogy (Bird With The Crystal Plumage(1970), Cat O' Nine Tails(1971) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet(1972)] from legendary director Dario Argento brings us a mystery about Franco Arno a blind puzzle maker who overhears a strange conversation between two men sitting in a parked car in front of a medical institute. That same night someone breaks into the institute and attacks a guard. Franco decides to investigate with newspaper reporter Carlo Giordoni. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Modern masterpiece!,Karl (Billy Bob Thorton) is a mentally challenged former killer that done a serious crime 25 years ago has been released back home. While he's there he meets and befriends a young boy (Lucas Black) and his widowed mother (Natalie Canerday) whom has trouble with the abusive boyfriend Doyle (Dwight Yokem) as it suddenly remindes Karl of his horrific past.
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,"Before Gladiator, there was...Ben-Hur","Ben-Hur set the bar for period films of today, and although the graphics in this film fail in comparision there is yet to be a film of this magnitude that can hold a candle to it.  Ben-Hur is truly one of a kind and one that will never be repeated.  Telling the story of wealthy Jewish Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) as his political ideas clash with his old friend and now Roman official Messala (Stephen Boyd) and cost him his friendship and almost his life.  After their outing Messala uses anything he can to put Judah away, and when an accident almost costs the governer his life Messala finally has his excuse to send Judah to the gallows and throw his mother and sister in prison.  Judah vows to get his revenge, and much like Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator, Ben-Hur is given his chance in the most unique of circumstances.  This epic is the best of the best, and while others have come close (Gladiator coming the closest) there is still yet to come another Ben-Hur.  At 4 hours in length this may not be a one seating type film, but it's well worth the time is takes to watch it through.  With brilliant performances on all fronts, Ben-Hur stands alone as one of the most worthy films to ever grace the oscars and one of the best films to ever take top honors.  A worthy addition to your DVD collection.  You won't be dissapointed"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,what do you mean you LOST THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i can still remember sitting down in front of the t.v. and watching the pilot movie as a kid and loving the idea of a superhero who was as lost about his powers as i felt about my 12 year old body at the time. funny and action packed this was a great show and i am glad to see that it has made it's way onto dvd. william katt,connie selleca,and the great robert culp star as the ""team"" of teacher ralph hinkley,bill maxwell,and pam davidson and they were a great team!"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,AN ADDICTION,"I bought it and watched the first episode and thought, ""What is this?""  I watched the second episode and then the third and couldn't stop until both seasons were done.  I've never gotten so wrapped up in the characters of a show before and am excitedly awaiting the release of the specials."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Good Vintage Video,"The audio/video quality of the original movie is not quite up to modern picture and sound standards, and the original play and movie we indelibly tied to the 50's scene (""Cool, man""), but the transition to DVD has not hurt it a bit. The songs and dancing are very stylized, definitely reflecting Donen's handicraft. Seeing the actors when they were almost kids is very interesting. I definitely enjoyed it"
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,A TRULY AUTHENTIC YOGA PRACTICE - - ,"Flow & Yin is truly a refreshing and balanced practice. As an avid practitioner (owning 80+ yoga practices with studio practice 2x week), this DVD is one of my favorites. Filmed in a beautiful studio environment, students of all shapes, sizes and levels practice along with you. The DVD begins with a 50 minute flow sequence (mainly standing postures), challenging enough for advanced practitioners (as Donna provides variations throughout) and encouraging enough for the advanced beginner (you will not want to give up). The Yin practice loosens connective tissue, as the floor poses are held for a longer period of time than traditional classes. The practice is light on Sanskrit terminology -- and easy to follow for those unfamiliar with yoga terminology. "
dvd,17 of 20,5.0,The best anti-nuclear war film ever made.,"The Day After Trinity, the story of the making and firing of the first atomic bomb, tells in stark, factual interviews the story of the Faustian bargain we made with atomic energy. Tracing the steps taken by our  government and leading scientists and focusing on J. Robert Oppenheimer, it  is a compelling, riveting story of personal ambition, scientific  curiousity, and tragic regret. The martyrdom of Oppenheimer is particularly  well-told. Combining the American &quot;can-do&quot; spirit, the  philosopher/scientist elite, World War II militarism, and Mc-Carthyism, it  is a compelling guide to understanding for anyone interested in the 1950s"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Complex and riveting drama,"The perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal (Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Ko Nishimura) are pursued by the illegitamate son (Toshiro Mifune) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes.  This film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic, but the masterful director Akira Kurosawa is not content to let it rest there.  He draws out all the moral complexities of the situation, then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title.  The bad may not always go to prison for their crimes, but do they really ""sleep well?"

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Should be mandatory viewing for all Modern American History classes,"You know how every single American English class in ever single school in America has to read at least one Mark Twain book?  Well, the same circumstance should be set for this film in relation to modern American history courses."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Superb movie treatment of the Dark Knight,"At last, there is a film worthy of DC Comics' second great superhero.  When Tim Burton's 1989 film came out, I was very impressed, and enjoyed the film immensely (even if I never was completely sold on Michael Keaton as Batman).  I remember leaving the theater thinking it was a really good film, but disappointed that it didn't prove to be as stirring as ""Superman: the Movie"" had been in 1978.  It's interesting how the passage of the years, and the appearance of numerous other superhero pictures, has affected my perception of both films.  Even if the special effects are a little dated, Richard Donner's Superman film remains a powerful, thrilling, entertaining movie, and is still the definitive movie treatment of the character.  Burton's Batman, however, has not aged so well.  In fact, after recently watching my old VHS copy of Burton's movie, I wonder what I ever really saw in it.  The gothic/art deco Gotham seen in the film is a visual feast, but comes off seeming a bit too much.  Keaton is physically just all wrong for the part, and while he acts the part of Batman well enough, his Bruce Wayne seems like a clueless, socially inept geek, not a billionaire playboy.  Most of the supporting characters (Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, et al.) are unmemorable.  And finally, the focus seems to be more on the villian (the Joker) than on the title character (indeed, this was a problem with all the four films in this series).  When I recently re-watched Burton's take on the character, I found the Batman looking inexcusably hokey in his first onscreen appearance, a rooftop fight with a couple of muggers.  He doesn't look scary at all, and when he walks toward the muggers ""flapping"" his cape downward once like wings, it looks so ridiculous that you just can't buy the reaction of one of the crooks a few moments later when he wails: ""what are you?""  You just can't believe a hardened thug would be so frightened of what is obviously just a guy in a weird-looking rubber suit."
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,good one,This is perhaps my favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. He plays the title character who must protect history against time-traveling crooks attempting to change history for their own good. The most dangerous is a senator (played by Ron Silver) trying to buy his way into the presidency. Any fan of action and science fiction will like this movie

dvd,10 of 10,5.0,King of the Wild Frontier,Walt Disney made five television shows about Davy Crockett with Fess Parker in the title role and Buddy Ebsen as his sidekick George Russel.  You can now own all five of these television shows in two versions.  This version presents all five television shows as they were first presented on ABC in the mid-1950s.  There is also a two-movie version that combines these five television shows into two movies.  I personally prefer the Disney Treasures version.  This version also includes additional material that may be interesting to a fan of the series.  The gem of the additional material is the interview with Fess Parker.
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Verhoeven's exercise in suspense thriller and excess ,Paul Verhoeven remains an interesting director who treads between art and commercialism with a European style of excess without alienating the audiences (unlike Godard!) His early Dutch films remain a fascinating watch.

John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Terrific Commentary - a keeper,"This is a terrific movie with a terrific director's commentary on DVD.  Excellent cast, including John Houseman's first acting gig.  "
dvd,20 of 20,4.0,"John Landis injects ""The Masters of Horror"" with a shot of comedy and the absurd","It is hard to categorize John Landis' contribution to the Showtime horror anthology series, ""The Masters of Horror"". Landis made a name for himself in the horror genre as the director of the classic early 80's werewolf film, An American Werewolf In London, and the clut classic vampire-noir film, Innocent Blood. With his ""Deer Woman"" episode, John Landis reaches back to his past work and comes up with an episode that mixes horror, absurd situations and a healthy dose of black comedy."
dvd,4 of 17,4.0,A charming tale of forbidden love,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger (in that order) give a great performance in this Hollywood epic tale of forbidden love. With this movie you get all the best of Hollywood technology, scenery, audio, video, casting and acting. The story in my opinion gets a little long and drawn out, losing some of it's appeal potential. It consists of a 20 year relationship of two cowboys who fall in love in 1963 while herding sheep together in Wyoming. These two break the rules wherever necessary to share their romance known only to them and their clueless wives who eventually figure it out but don't know how to bring up the subject. As their marriages become strained over the years, their love for each other continues to grow, but can never become the full time relationship they crave. The story could have in my opinion been written much better for a screenplay. I think most anyone could have written a better ending for this saga, but that is nothing new for Hollywood. No matter how many millions of dollars they spend to make the perfect movie, none of them seem to know how to end one. If the subject matter of this film offends you, you WILL NOT want to see this one. Although it never gets explicitly graphic with the sex scenes, there's enough there to offend opponents of such film subject matter. All in all, I enjoyed the movie on DVD. I do not have a widescreen television, but didn't notice anything out of the ordinary on this widescreen version. Perhaps someone with a widescreen could better review this version. Beautiful scenery from Wyoming and mostly Canada. Great nostalgic representation. I recommend watching Brokeback Mountain if you are into gay romance. It is thought provoking and realistic for the era it represents"
dvd,8 of 8,4.0,"IT'S A BIGGER, BADDER, AND MUCH HUNGRIER BLOB: BUT PROBABLY NOT THE LAST","The first ""BLOB"" starring Steve McQueen is a ""reel"" cult classic, but this remake, 30 years its junior, has to survive on its own merit. With Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon matched as the unlikely hero couple pitted against an updated, more extravagant, and much more menacing blob, only the plot can hold them back. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,"Dated, but still good","If you're like me, the ""older guy"" in the neighborhood that has all the really good old movies, you'll want this in your collection.  The scene where Szell, the Nazi War Criminal, is spotted walking down the street in New York's Diamond District is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.  And, of course, no Hoffman collection would be complete without this one.  "
dvd,26 of 29,4.0,Lolida and the Sex Patrol,"Oh my goodness, they've outlawed sex! That is the premise for this hokey so called Sci-Fi Semi-Porn film. At some future, unspecified, (probably 2000 since Lolida 2000 is the title, course it's 2005 and it didn't happen) date the sex act and anything connected to sex has been outlawed. (and you thought prohibition was extreme) So what we have here is a sex film, where sex is banned but hark, never worry, Lolida or is it Lolita, this is so... confusing, is here to save the day. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"""Rockin' from the Delta to the DMZ!""","Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,More Than Just a Comedy Series,"If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's.  The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,A children's classic,This film is a like a breath of fresh air compared to the animated computer nonsense that rules movie theaters these days.  I remember true children's movies that touched our imaginations and made us have pleasant dreams.  Parents would be smart to show their children the movies they grew up watching rather than this new trash. This is a must have for children of all ages (even 28 year olds). 
dvd,,5.0,A voice from above!,There is an Angel walking this great earth and her name is ALISON KRAUSS!
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,I had forgotten how good this season was,"Not only was I surprised at how well written and acted the first season was, but I was also blown away at how vivid and sharp the image looks. TOS was actually filmed and then transferred to video tape, so when they remastered the series, they were able to go back to the film source. As a result, the picture looks nearly as good as any dvd movie. Much better in fact than any of the more recent star trek series which were video taped. One draw back to this is that you can see how cheesy the control panels on the ship are"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Film noir rides again!,"After Tarantino's selfindulgent Jackie Brown, I feared the film noir genre was kaput. Out comes A History of Violence and my faith is renewed."
dvd,13 of 17,5.0,Fantastic Work,"It`s amazing to see the whole Bible on DVD. This is my dream, to have it all. The 6 DVD Bible Collection are the most important story from the Bible, and the production is more than excelent. I can say that accuracy is 80 % from the Bible. Don't forget, if you buy this frm US and you are in EU, you have to pay 17-20 euro more at every package received from AMAZON. So, it`s not very nice.."
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Good Times,"Watching this show as a kid I thought it was great; but now rewatching it as an adult I can clearly see the messages they were trying to portray each week.  Despite the fact that James and FLorida were quite poor and sometimes didn't know where the next meal was coming from they wanted to instill good values into their children to help them make the right choices in life.  Even with all the yelling and bickering there was a lot of love along with some ""Dyn-O-Mite"" comedy.  "
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,"reaction to ""chain""","the first time i saw this movie i really didn't think to much about it, but after a 2nd viewing i have to admit that i did like it more. it's silly and unbeliveable but it is fun and thats the point!! they all try so hard to make the story work and in spite of the holes in the script it works. a good family action movie. for the price it's worth a look"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,ABBA as antidepressant,"This collection of music videos just makes me smile and feel warm. The video concepts are low tech (Agnetha and Anni-Frida sing at each other, facing 90 degrees away from each other or into mirrors) but they are so earnest and the music so upbeat (even when they are singing about the break up of their repectives marriages) that I couldn't resist singing along.  The DVD is worth the purchase alone just to see the progression of the women's hairstyles from poodle perm to sleek flat ironed to cranberry colored mullet with a headband"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,This Movie Is Fricken Hilarious!,"This is the first movie in The Austin Powers series and I think it is absolutely hilarious. Mike Myers is a riot as swinging 60's British spy Austin Powers brought out from a cryogenic chamber in 1997 where he has been since about 1967 or 1968. He has been thawed out because he has to foil the sinister plans of his extremely eccentric archenemy Dr. Evil also played by Mike Myers. There is an excellent cast in this movie, not just Mike Myers but also Seth Green as Dr. Evil's son Scott, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kenzington, and also Robert Wagner as Number Two. There are a lot of funny jokes and gags in this movie that just may have you rolling on the floor with laughter and I highly recommend this DVD to people who love to have a good laugh and don't mind that there are a couple of raunchy jokes and gags. The DVD has some great extra features including deleted scenes"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,HILARIOUS!!!!,The one-liners 7 sight gags in this film really keep it fresh and fast paced. My favorite has to be Ray Charles driving the city bus. &quot;Next stop Melrose...I think!&quot
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,M.D.,Really great results. The work-outs get to the point. You feel the burn and know that you are doing the exercises properly.  Very happy with the DVDs. 
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Mansur's Chappelle Show Season 2 Review,"This season was off the hook!  I couldn't believe how hilarious it was.  I was laughing like crazy on almost every sketch.  The bonus disc with unedited interviews with Charley Murphy and Rick James were by far, to me, the funniest!  Definately worth your while"
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Excellent quality Circus DVD,The quality of this DVD is excellent- it WAS an Oscar winning movie.  The story is slow with some campy acting by Betty Hutton but it is an excellent observation of the circus as it was in its glory years.  Between the cheesy drama and slow story there is excellent documentary-type footage of the Ringling Brother Show
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Amazing!!!,"This is simply one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It is visually stunning, and well-researched.  This should be required viewing for any introductory art history class, as well as for any person who intends to travel and wants to understand some of the art they will be seeing"
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Stylish 70's ultra-chic European Detective Drama,"Being a fan of Robert Vaughn from his Man From UNCLE days, I purchased this set on a whim at Tower Records over three months ago (why does Amazon say it will not be available until November?) and was pleasantly surprised.  These half-hour episodes are cleverly written and entertaining.  The European locales also add an extra bit of flair to these shows. The acting is good--especially Space 1999 alumnus Tony Anholt.  When will the Second season be released?"
dvd,1 of 9,5.0,A+ Vendor,Item was as described and delivered promptly.  I don't see how it could have been a better shopping experience
dvd,,5.0,A Great Fairytale Movie!!!,The movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money. They are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest. This is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale
dvd,3 of 10,4.0,The Great Battle of 1965,"This film is about the battle in the Ia Drang valley in 1965 Vietnam. It begins in 1954 when a French patrol is attacked and defeated in a surprise ambush. A prophecy for the future? In one scene a wounded French soldier is killed. [Was this truth or drama?] Then in 1964 we see children in a car singing a tune based on ""Sambre et Meuse"", which dates to the Napoleonic Wars. Next we see a training camp where helicopters will be used in ground battles. [Wasn't this an adaption of a civilian model?] One scene shows officer's wives discussing local conditions and the laundromat. [Are the defective washing machines at the camp a symbol of failure?] One scene recalls Custer's last battle. Custer did not know the size of the enemy; he assumed about 2,500 and not three times as many. Later we hear the Intelligence officer admit they did not know the size of the enemy forces. Ominous?"

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,So much fun I contemplated trying it!!,"John and Jeremy party hearty crashing weddings, until, of course, the inevitable happens: They fall in love themselves.  "
dvd,5 of 20,2.0,Prime Dumb!!!,"I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like ""Prime Cut"".  You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters.  This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's ""Lew Wasserman"" type production deals"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,"Great entertainment, a lot of fun",I have this movie on DVD and watch it periodically.
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,The simplest things," I generally hate rom-coms.  Occasionally though, watching two people falling in love and expressing it in a very simple way just gets through and wins my heart. For me, The Edukators works on the same level. It is a film which allows important ideas about the politics in our lives to be conveyed in a very simple way. And I see this as a great strength. Too often, complexity and overanalysis can dull us to a concept we fundamentally believe in and give us the excuse to deny its power. I'd be interested to ask those who complain that the politics here are too stripped down and ""text-book"" when they actually last heard sypathetic characters with such pure ideology given a voice and the chance to chase down their beliefs in a big screen drama, in front of the world, as opposed to in the campus bar.  We don't resist the simplicity of ""I love you"".  Yet what could be more complex than love?  I enjoyed the rush of spending time with characters who say ""I believe I can change things"" and are allowed to have a go at doing just that. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Good follow up to The Santa Clause,"While The Santa Clause 2 may not pack the same punch as the original Santa Clause starring Tim Allen, this sequel is a fun addition for your Christmas viewing collection.  Taking up the story of Scott Calvin (Allen) eight years after he became Santa Claus, this hilarious sequel presents the problems Scott faces when he finds out that his son Charlie's name appears on the ""naughty"" list.  Scott faces the dilemma of either finding a wife by Christmas eve or giving up his much-loved position as Santa Claus forever.  You'll love watching how the story unfolds with the help of his loyal elves and much warmth and holiday fun."
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Treasures is a perfect title for this DVD!,"As a musical theatre lover I've seen a lot of footage from various tony's & concerts, but this was delightful!  The wide range of preformances and preformers are just great!  I'd get this based only on the fact that it has Patti LuPone doing Anthing Goes on it!  :)  Also, the selections from Jelly's Last Jam & Chicago are just great!  Enjoy!  (and if you haven't seen the first Lost treasures DVD, treat yourself to that!)"
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,its a bond between the beatles,"if you remember the 60s and the james bond era,then this movie needs no introduction to you..its simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes."
dvd,2 of 4,1.0,A Horrible Movie,The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Hysterical!,"Loved it!  Great songs, lots of talented actors, hysterical.  The theme and story are a little cheesy, but the way it is put together will have you rolling on the floor with laughter.  Great performances by all.  I couldn't stop laughing.  It is one of my favorites.  If you want a fun, light hearted good time movie with lots of laughs and some good tunes.... get this movie.  You won't regret it.  I've watched it over and over and love it.  Really really recommend!  Enjoy"
dvd,28 of 29,4.0,Keaton's Remarkable Apprenticeship,"Without the generosity and support of comedian Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, the cinematic art of Buster Keaton may never have blossomed. The 12 existing shorts in ""The Best Arbuckle/Keaton Collection"" display Arbuckle's comedic skill while revealing the astonishing speed in which co-star Keaton mastered the medium. After 15 two-reelers from 1917 to 1920, Buster was ready to fly solo with a remarkable string of masterpieces. Sadly, Arbuckle's subsequent career in features was unjustly destroyed by the 1921 scandal, yet he persevered and made an all-too-brief comeback before his untimely death in 1933. Admittedly, not all the Arbuckle-Keaton shorts are gems, but ""The Butcher Boy"" (1917), ""Back Stage"" (1919) and ""The Garage"" (1920) remain memorable comedies that showcase Fatty and Buster's effortless rapport. Despite some unfortunate racial humor, ""Out West"" (1918) is a wild, fast-paced romp that satirizes the Westerns of William S. Hart. Though the prints vary in quality, one must be grateful that they exist at all. ""The Best Arbuckle/Keaton Collection"" represents a valuable chapter in the history of film comedy"
dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Another brilliant season of the legendary series,"The second season of HBO's Tales From the Crypt piled on the gore and gallows humor, not to mention the guest stars and those behind the camera as well.  John Kassir is once again the voice of the Cryptkeeper as he provides 18 bloody tales of murder, mayhem, the supernatural, and other things you'll have to see to believe.  Standout episodes here are ""Dead Right"", in which Demi Moore stars as a gold digger who gets everything she wishes for and then some; ""The Switch"", a tale of an old millionaire looking for a new lease on life (which was directed by none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger!); ""Korman's Kalamity"", which stars Harry Anderson as a cartoonist whose horriffic drawings are coming to life; and ""The Secret"" which features a young orphan given a life of luxury, but both his foster parents and he have some deadly secrets.  The aforementioned episodes are some of the best the series ever offered, but it's ""Cutting Cards"", ""Fitting Punishment"", and the brilliant ""Lower Berth"" that are landmarks of the series, as well as ""Television Terror"" starring Morton Downey as a trash TV host who gets much, much more than he bargained for when he investigates a haunted house.  For fans of the series, this entire DVD set is a must own, but it's a shame that there weren't many extras thrown in.  Nevertheless, for those of us who have been waiting for complete season sets, you already know that this is a must have"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Great Flick,"I dont need to explain the plot of ""Trainspotting"", as pretty much ever other review has already done that.  The film is half serious, half comical view of an extremely destructive, depressing lifestyle.  I dont know if this won any awards, but it really should have because for the most part it doesnt follow any hollywood clich'es.  Peac"
dvd,,5.0,Awesome Show! Awesome Series!,"I guard the 24 series with my life, I don't loan it to friends, if they want to watch they get to come over and watch it.  George Mason (Xander Berkeley) plays an awesome role in this series. And Jack is as hardcore as ever"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A fun way to kickbox across the years,"I never get tired of THIS Jean Claude Van Damme flick. He plays an agent for a secret government agency that is charged with maintaining the integrity of the timestream.  When he steps into a conspiracy led by a corrupt senator who squinty eyes (Ron Silver plays a great jerk) are on the Whitehouse, things really get exciting."
dvd,9 of 11,5.0,Perfect for the right sort of fan,"This is a perfect release for someone like me--I saw the films in my teens and never paid the slightest bit of attention to them thereafter. I haven't ever bought a tape or dvd of any of the Star Wars stuff, but was intrigued by the idea of finally being able to see the orginals. The theatrical release on the bonus disc doesn't look too bad--especially at night in a dark room.   I have a 26 -inch LCD: it looks fine if I leave it with bars on all four sides, and loses something when I zoom in."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Son can't get enough,"My son absolutely LOVES this DVD. I now have to ""sneak"" his other abc and 123 educational DVD's in when I can but if he had his way, he'd simply watch I Dig Dirt over and over and over. It is educational, but only about the earth moving equimpent in the show (which is pretty impressive). I wish there were more like it"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Best Anime Feature of All time,"This one still can't be beat for its quality story, anime, sound, action. The story might be a bit complicated for simpletons but what can you do. If your an Adult looking for a Full length Action oriented Anime Feature with a Great story with no kiddy factor you found the best"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,La Ciudad,"I found La Ciudad a very different movie from any other movies I have wathched. This movie is split into four narratives of Latino immigrants living in the city of New York. Immigrants come to the US with many dreams in their minds. These dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education, getting rich, and living a happy and high standard life. This movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government. This movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations. For example, Luis's daughter Dulce cannot get addmission to school, and Ana cannot do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with Ana. I like it how the movie is shown in black and white; it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie. It also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the US, they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations. Overall, I really liked the movie and I would encourage anyone to see it"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Put this one in your rotation!,"This is a very good workout; for the most part it's easy to follow, thanks to Karen's perfect cueing, and it's not your run-of-the-mill toning video. She's solo throughout the entire workout, making it easy to follow her and concentrate on proper form. She does use a body bar (for balance) and weighted balls, but you can just as easily hold onto a chair or wall and use dumbells. The set is weird; I find it a bit distracting with huge drapes, and there are a few bad camera angles (nothing major). The first two segments are toning routines and the last segment, my favorite, is a stretching/yoga routine. Although this isn't my favorite Karen Voight video (I like some of her earlier weight training videos better), she seems like she's really enjoying herself in this video. Sometimes she has a tendency not to look very enthusiastic in her workouts, although I'm glad she's not one of these way too perky instructors who whoops and hollars all the time. My aunt has been to several of her classes and she says Karen is a very pleasant person, and her classes are always packed (when she's actually there). I'm glad she's just as professional in her videos, and this one should be in your rotation"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Turn it up,All in all a respectable movie. Obviously no urban movies are gunna be winning awards but if given the proper amount of showing to audiences this movie could rate up there with the best urban movies. Ja rule's acting is amazing for a freshman appearence and pras hits the sympathetic actor alrite. I give it about 7.5/10 on my scale and would highly suggest watching it to any fan of hip hop. The soundtrack to go with it/songs preformed within the movie by ja rule and pras are also very good
dvd,,5.0,Pleased To Have Found This Movie Still Available ,"This foreign (French)film had a short run on cable some thirty years ago and was later remade with an American cast and a  rather lame, and Hollywood type ending. Recently I saw the American version on satellite cable and was reminded of the original. This version is not readily available and thus I was extremely pleased to have found its availability on Amazon."
dvd,,5.0,Good Stuff," I think this arrived the next day:pretty damn quick! Brand-new merchandise, works perfectly. Great stuff"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,An unusual sci-fi allegory,"This film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way.  The plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally.  Instead, what Logan's Run offers is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state.  Some of the scenes are riveting, such as the early depiction of sanitized mass murder carried out in a spectacular ceremony.  There are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death.  The world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic.  The environment is a kind of shallow, Disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape.  The implicit subtext of the movie, that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap, is well taken.          "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Highly recommended,"Be my guest and watch this emotional film. The old man is the directors father, who is a director of famous films, too.  Be prepared for the scene when the little boy phones his grandmother. That one scene is still strong in my memory. I rented the film first, then bought it. This is not one you would find at the local rental store.  You have to use Netflix.com and the like. Again, do not let the sub titles scare you away. The film is so well acted that you may not need to read them."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A TREASURE TROVE OF VINTAGE HORROR CLASSICS!,"""The Val Lewton Horror Collection"" is the quintessential prize to any serious classic horror collector's DVD library.  With the atmospheric classics ""Cat People"" and it's sequel ""Curse of the Cat People,"" as two of the most familiar of the nine films presented here.  Both films deal with the lovely Simone Simon, as an ill-fated woman who has the ability to turn herself into a black panther!  ""The Cat People"" makes the most sense of the two, however, ""Curse of the Cat People"" has an atmospheric beauty to it, almost like a dream in its presentation.  Both are very enjoyable. ""I Walked With a Zombie"" is probably the most coveted of the collection, for it's subject matter dealing with voodoo, a love triangle, and the hauntingly beautiful woman who is drawn to the voodoo cult by their jungle drums, is highly entertaining throughout.  ""The Body Snatcher"" featuring the diabolical Boris Karloff as a grave robbing ghoul is also of high merit in this collection.  ""Isle of the Dead"" also features the great Karloff, leading a small band of people who quarantine themselves on a small island due to the plague.  A superstition by one of the women arises fear in Karloff that the beautiful girl among them may be a vampire!  Karloff returns once more as the head master of an English asylum in ""Bedlam.""  A young woman wants to help the poor people of the asylum, but is wrongfully committed by Karloff.  ""Bedlam"" contains an ending that is both suspenseful and humorous; (one of the patients keeps suggesting Wise Solomon's solution of ""cut him into."")  ""The Leopard Man"" is also a nice addition, with a change of scenery.  Instead of the usual English settings consisting of fog and thunderstorms, we are given a Mexican village that is plagued with a possible ""leopard man"" which is supported by the local superstitious of the village.  ""The Ghost Ship"" is somewhat entertaining, but not as rich in it's story as the before mentioned.  And last, but not least is the cult driven ""The Seventh Victim"" with a young woman trying to locate her missing sister who she discovers had dealings with a satanic cult.  The documentary of ""Shadows in the Dark"" gives great insight to the making of these classic films and is a nice added addition to the set.  "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"""You're just like them!""","With a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit...I found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me...this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers.  The story is a brutally honest one about racism in Mississippi in the year 1995.  A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held.  The film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly, Jake (McConaughey) as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed KKK as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty.  The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined.  Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through.  Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Keifer & Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd and Chris Cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,The only Hollywood romance you need,"This is one of those classic romantic dramas that manages to get you in the old-fashioned, Hollywood way. Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly, a playgirl and escort trying to marry into money. George Peppard is Paul Varjak, a struggling writer being ""supported"" by an older woman. The film follows the pair as they get to know each other, accept their feelings, and deal with their lot in life."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,One of the biggest surprises in films,"I wasn't expecting this film to be much of anything, but upon viewing I was blown away! Right up til' the end with the twist... WOW! I'd definitely give it 5 stars and see it again. Well acted, timed and scripted.... A great thriller in every sense of the word"
dvd,,5.0,Funny Movie for the Whole Family ,"If you saw the first one, you will love this one. It is just as funny.  If you have teen daughters they will love it because it has Tom Welling and Hilary Duff in it.  You will love it because it is funny."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,It's quite surprising how much it holds up,"Before South Park came on the air and offended practically everybody with cripple fights to cooking parents in chili to saying the S word a record 162 times, there was Beavis and Butthead. Found on MTV, the pair were crude and just plain moronic who laughed at even the mention of dirty words bringing out the popular catchphrase ""uh-huh, you said "". After the show ended, the pair got their own movie and became a surprise hit so who would've guessed that it's actually still funny?"
dvd,17 of 18,4.0,A great pilates dvd but definitely not for beginners,"The magic circle most definitely adds a different dimension to basic pilates exercises and really helps me focus on my powerhouse. However, if you are new to pilates, this should NOT be the first dvd you buy. I would recommend Pilates for Dummies first and once you master the basic pilates moves, then go on to the Classical Pilates with the magic circle dvd. The reason is that this dvd moves really REALLY fast and there are virtually no instruction on how to do the moves. Once you have master the basic pilates moves, then this dvd is great because you get a fantastic workout and the magic circle really makes it more of a challenge. I didn't even attempt to try the super advanced reformer mat exercise that comes with the DVD. However, I hope someday I will"
dvd,,5.0,A thousand nightmares lie in wait...,"For dark things dwell in this house of fear,"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,The Additional footage is well worth watching*****,"I recently saw the uncut 293 min version and was pleased to see that the additional footage added even more depth to an already amazing piece of film...you can read my original review of this film under the ""directors cut"" that I wrote yesterday, and whether you choose to believe or disbelieve what I referred to in my past is your choice. "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Love Backyardigans,"My 17 month-old boy absolutely loves the Backyardigans. This is his 5th Backyardigans' DVD. He enjoys Suff up, but the Tower of power scares him a lot. He's just too young to understand this episode. So, I just skip it @ this moment. I particularly like this DVD for the music selection (Salsa, merengue, Bachata, etc.. Latin Music). I just smile when I see ""Uniqua & Pablo"" dancing Salsa with a lot of swing. I also enjoy to listen Autin singing his version of ""Juan Talamera"" as the Mystery Life Guard. I just glad my son has the opportunity to grow up with such of good musical & cultural material, like the Backyardigans' dvds."
dvd,,4.0,Return of the Oompa-Loompas,"We went as a family to the theater to see ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". The involvement of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, along with the need to see another treatment of Roald Dahl's classic children's book got me interested. We have the '70s musical version with Gene Wilder on VHS. It was OK but didn't quite capture Dahl's magic. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,One of my favorites,"Some reviewers need to actually watch the whole anime and others need to consider how the adverage person would see this. No one is going to say, ""Oh there were 4 shots to that moster and only one hit and showed blood, that is definately crappy animation and proof of laziness."" Most people are looking at story not how the animation in each battle scene was played out. Something like that shouldn't even be a star unless everyone can tell that it's really bad and really apparent to everyone that the animation is bad and not a couple subtleties in the anime. If you really want to see animation that will annoy you (something that everyone can see as annoying) take a look at Gantz (though it is good so far from the 13 episodes that I have seen) trying to do a 3d camera with 2d animation (I believe that one was also animated by Ganzo) One thing that note should be given to the dubbing aduio because most people that buy the anime listen to English version and bad dubbing (which is easily noticable) can really throw something off like every time Square Enix has raped Final Fantasy with bad voiceovers, but ADV doesn't have a problem with that so it should all be perfect."
dvd,,5.0,Tight Cut for any Snoop Fan,"Lotz of footage of Snoop & his homies blazin fat ass blunts onstage & backstatge, interviews w/Snoop, Nate Dogg, Warren G, Tha Eastsidaz, Don Juan, & a few others, Live preformances, Exclusive footage from High Times & Norml Events (for the chokers), & plenty of other good sh*t.  Gotta check this out & also cop ""the up in smoke tour"" w/ Dre, Cube, Snoop, & E"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Cutting Edge to the Extreme,"The 80s totally rocked, with laid back teenagers who were a little wild, a little care free. Who doesn't love that? Especially when it's in a movie like ""Heathers"". This black comedy is totally wild, in a very great way. It's unlike any other movie I've seen, everything about it is very special. The language, the situations, the attitudes and actions of the cool but bizarre characters."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Awesome, A must have!","I finally found out this was out on DVD after having the VHS version for many years.  The DVD edit is very close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later, which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to the performance."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Just as I remembered it!,"This is a wonderful set--a few years ago I saw a truncated movie version of Spin and Marty, but it was a mere shadow of the series as I remembered it--omissions of little but beloved scenes, continuity problems, and somehow lacking some essential rhythm.  Discovering this was a delight.  You can watch it one episode at a time like back when it was on TV, or if you're stuck in bed with the flu, you can pig out on the whole thing in a lovely glut of childhood regression."
dvd,2 of 8,5.0,Hilarious DVD Set,"Very funny, I was laughing to the point of tears. Since this season ended with cliffhangers in the last episode you can be sure the Season 3 DVD is coming soo"

dvd,19 of 19,1.0,frustrating!!!,"I'm mad to have paid for this DVD! Mr. Pozo only teaches and demonstrates the man's part for most steps, which is frustrating since the woman's part is exactly the opposite. He goes through everything so quickly we kept having to stop and back it up. It doesn't teach you to dance, and it especially doesn't teach you in minutes."

dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Undertakers dvd is a 5 star dvd ,80-76%-perfect
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Alyson Hannigan-WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG!!!,"This is just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy. The plot-an alien (Kim Bassinger) comes to Earth to study the planet and in doing so falls in love with a scientist (Dan Akroyd). But things are not all sun and fun! Dan's daughter (played by Alyson Hannigan!) suspects things are not all gravy on the home front and investigates his new love interest. Needless to say-hilarity ensues. The best part of the film is the scene when a really young Seth Green comes to take Alyson on a date. Buffy Fans!!-You'll really like seeing Seth and Alyson together. Rent the movie if you see it, you'll have a good time"

dvd,21 of 26,5.0,Africa made accessible,Irresistible vignettes depict real Africans carrying out their life journeys presented in an intimate and compelling fashion.  Eight stories (2 per disk) from divergent geographic and cultural settings illuminate the breadth and diversity of people who call this continent home.    
dvd,4 of 7,4.0,Almost Perfection!,"It's so nearly flawless. Practically without imperfection. George Hearn is superb. Nobody but Hearn can do Sweeney like he can. Neil Patrick Harris is the perfect Tobias. But (and this is a rather large ""but"") Patti LuPone's characterization of Lovett was ghastly and horrifically unlikable.  I was especially disappointed in her ersatz cockney accent that seem to have an attention span all its own. LuPone has an exceptional range and can certainly belt out a Broadway tune. But (and there's that insidious ""but"" again) this was not the role for her. Just cuz ya can sing the song, duzn't mean ya can play the part! Treat yourself--see Angela Lansbury's Lovett. It's unforgettable"
dvd,,5.0,Perhaps the Best Of The Series,"Paramount's ""The Naked Gun"" series is one of the few film series in cinematic history to go through three films and still remain consistent. The third entry of the series, ""The Naked Gun 33 1/3 - The Final Insult"" was relased three years after the previous installment, ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2 - The Smell Of Fear"", in 1994. "
dvd,7 of 7,4.0,Edward G. steals the show,"""House of Strangers"" commences with Richard Conte playing disgraced lawyer Max Monetti visiting his three brothers Joe, Tony and Pietro in the bank that they own.  He's just been released from prison and apparently has vengeance on his mind.  After his less than cordial call he proceeds to return to the now deserted family homestead.  He has a flashback and we learn what has caused his predicament."
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"Simple, but very watchable.","After watching the movie you'll wonder if it was the simplicity of the movie or the overwhelming charm and beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno that captivated your attention. I guess it is a combination of both (however, I am tempted to give more marks to the sparkling beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno)."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Absolutely Truly Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This iz one of my favorite dvds! I watch the beefs 
dvd,2 of 6,2.0,Should've just bought the soundtrack,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  I am not a dance fan but I do enjoy watching a good folk dance performance -- that is what I expected this to be but it was nothing like what I imagined.  The visual and audio were out of sync at times and that is especially disturbing when watching a tap/clogging performance.  The camera switched views much too frequently which was also very distracting.  If you think that you are getting three videos in one be careful -- ""Lord of the Dance"" and ""Feet of Flames"" are pretty much the same thing but done at different times and places with maybe some different costumes.  The performance was much too ""artsy"" for me but some people like it that way.  If I were to do it again I would just purchase the soundtrack"
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Know What You're In For Before You See This,"Boy, did this movie disappoint a lot of people.....but not me."
dvd,29 of 31,4.0,Unearthed Gems From the Great Stone Face,"Buster Keaton was a prolific artist until the very end. ""Industrial Strength Keaton"" chronicles the comic legend's remarkable achievement from the silent era to the television age. There are many unearthed gems in this two-disc set -- plus a few obscurities that should have stayed in the vault. Among the highlights: a reconstruction of ""The Playhouse"" (1921); rare newsreel footage from the 1920s and '30s; a plethora of live TV apperances and commercials; and a delightful, never-before-seen industrial film titled ""The Home Owner"" (in which Buster displays his honorary Oscar). The few surviving fiascos -- such as the no-budget ""An Old Spanish Custom"" (1935) and the amateurish ""Devil to Pay"" (1960) -- are strictly for Keaton completists. A decidedly uneven collection, but fascinating nonetheless."
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,a decent film,"definitely not a bad film, but  a masterpiece is different."
dvd,,5.0,Greatest show on earth,"Best comedy since BBCs The Office. Fantastic details. Can watch it over and over again, and discover new things every time"
dvd,,5.0,Let it be known: This is NOT just a kid's show!!,"Okay, I started watching Avatar when it first started airing, but I started to get forgetful and stopped watching it.  Well, I just rented this, and I have to admit, I am becoming a fan.  This show is a ton of fun to watch!  Nowadays, the only other Nick show you can say that about is Spongebob, which I have watched since it first aired in '99, and it's starting to lose it's charm.  Literally all of Nick's new show ideas have sucked, but this is a real find."
dvd,2 of 9,1.0,Gilbert Gottfried:  Dirty Jokes,Absolutely filthy. The title indicates jokes but there is nothing in here that resembles a joke. It is a continual litany of filthy statements. I am sorry I purchased this and only give it a 1 star because that is the lowest choice. I would give it a 0 or lower
dvd,0 of 4,4.0,Kylie on video,"as a fairly new Kylie fan, it was a lot of fun for me to see most of her videos for the first time ever, one after the other! The early videos are really embarrasing, especially ""The Locomotion"", but some of them have their charm like ""Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi"" and ""Got To Be Certain"". I really didn't like that my favorite Kylie song ever, ""Better The Devil You Know"", is represented here with such AWFUL sound quality. I'm not kidding, it's really bad. I don't understand why they couldn't just dub over it with the track from the Ultimate Kylie CD or something. Some of the early videos aren't in great quality either, ""Especially"" for you suffers ffrom too much brightness and contrast. Or maybe that's how the video was originally shot..?? But anyway, it's great to see Kylie's evolution, although i would have loved to have seen ""Finer Feelings"" and ""Some Kind of Bliss"" included"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Cook-Cook,"Our baby is 16 months old and loves Cookie Monster's Best Bites. She normally doesn't watch TV or even seem interested by it. When we put this DVD on, she's thrilled. She calls Cookie Monster ""Cook-Cook"" and previously only knew him through a few bath toys, books, stuffed animals, and the Sesame Street games on their website. Now, she dances, sings, and laughs along with him."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,"Artsy yoga, qi gong, body awarness & healing","The entire DVD is played in B&W in a beautiful studio w/Eastern sculptures & art. Duncan is on a simple hardwood floor with a natural mat & narrating the movements with simple, beautiful Eastern fused music. It has an artsy feel, beautiful use of lighting, very beautiful. The menu selections are: Full Workout, Awareness Level workout, Enlightening level workout, Chapter Index, Bonus Fatures. "
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,Entertaining!,"I enjoyed this film about a bounty hunter (Ice T) who chases a con man who keeps eluding him.  When the con man wins the mega lottery and then loses his ticket (in the boat of a nasty villian) he tries to enlist the aid of Ice T to get it back.  Unfortunately for him, Ice T does not believe him about the ticket and is not only interested in collecting the bounty for the con man and also recovering several million in diamonds that a bad guy has."
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Great series,"Avatar the last airbender is a great series in my opinion. Being interested in martial arts, different cultures and also being an artist myself, I find this vol ""2"" and the others to be a great action adventure toon for children and adults."
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,The 'Trick' is finding love when you least expect it...,Jim Fall's TRICK is a standout romantic comedy amongst many others with all-too stereotypical characters and storylines.  Christian Campbell (Gabriel) and J.P. Pitoc (Mark) work very well together on-screen in this story of finding love in the most unlikely of circumstances.

dvd,4 of 11,5.0,GO BRONCOS!,"Being a die hard Bronco fan since 1986 I can't wait for this DVD. From reliving the moments of the orange crush (I wish they still wore those uniforms!) to Elway's greatest comebacks, and of course the back to back Super Bowl victories.  I'm sure it will be a must have for any Broncomaniac. November 7th can't come soon enough"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,This Is How A Christmas Film Should Look!,"This film has been a favorite of mine for as long as I can remember.  Sure, it may be a little cheesy, easily predictable and perhaps even dated, but I can't help but love this classic film."
dvd,9 of 31,2.0,"James Bond Collection, Vol. 1","Although I'm not sure who's at fault, I ordered all three volumes of the James Bond Collections, from three different sellers.  This seller failed to include the box for the set, which angered me.  I was pretty sure that it did not say in his description that the box wasn't included!  He is purchasing the movies individually and selling them as a box set (to command more money)and to me that is very misleading!  I wanted to have all three box sets and ended up with 7 seperate Bond movies without the box!  I won't ever buy from this seller again"
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,Could be one of the best...,"I sat front row for this show in Vegas, you even see me about 5 times during the comedy central version of the show. Dane even gave me a high 5 (that missed barely) and was thankfully cut...lol. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella,"I ordered this specific Cinderella production because this is the version I grew up with in the late 50's and 60's.  I just love it and want to share this version with my grandchildren.  Even if you are not from my generation (baby boomer), this is the best Cinderella out there.  The costumes, production, music...it's all fabulous!  I would encourage everyone to buy this one"
dvd,10 of 10,4.0,"Low Budget, Big Value","I was browsing through and saw that some of the more recent reviews of this movie were ragging on the low budget quality of the film, which completely overlooks what it achieved. So I felt I needed to add my two cents on a lesbian film that will always hold a special place in my heart."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"this and the love bug, TWO GREAT ONES.",i saw this movie in the drive in theater. it was a double feature about cars. the love bug was shown first and than right after came chitty chitty bang bang. i was only eight years old when i saw these. it was back in 1971. anyway this chitty film is also very entertaining. a kid's musical that will brighten up your day
dvd,,5.0,6th SC,Great visual of the battle where my great grandfather fought with the 6th SC.  Entertaining and educational
dvd,,5.0,"once again, a classic","This, like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, is a classic because it is more like his movies now, except honestly this is better. This movie not only has non-stop laughs, but it also has a good amount of heart in it. Everyone is great in this film-my favorite characters in this movie would be the limo driver, the old man, and his brother in law. I highly recommend this film. Though I will add a note, if you are curious about buying this newer version because of the added material-there is only one scene added and it is rather short, though mildly humorous-basically the only reason to buy it would be for the better case. And thats not a very good reason at all"
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,I love this movie!,"I'm so glad to see this film is out on DVD. Brings back great memories of when I saw it in the middle of January in Chicago while staying there for a week with the folks on a business trip.  I just had to see this film after Roger Ebert tore it apart during his film review segment on the nightly news.  I think I was only about 14 years old when I caught a matinee showing in a downtown Chicago theater.  The film itself is nothing but alot of fun to watch and Brent Huff is a total hottie!  Lots of nudity, weird bondage outfits and basically a soft porn version of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  The musical score during the opening and closing credits is nice but the dialogue is badly dubbed.   The acting is horrible and the actress that plays the Queen has got to be seen to be believed!  Total cheeseball of a movie, but loads of fun to watch if you're just in the mood to have a good time.  Everyone that I know that has seen this film has loved it. (except for Roger Ebert"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Excelent,"  Eric Johnson is an excelent guitar player and a very good teacher also. I love this video, especially now with all the improvements and new features. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent Workout !,"I used to attend advanced step classes regularly at a gym until I moved to a remote area. I found this workout to be one of the best that I have bought online. Kathy Smith's Fat Burning Breakthrough has three segments of step aerobics consisting of eighteen minutes each with strength training sessions in between. The step segments are well choreographed with good upbeat music, and one of the four demonstrators performs the entire workout without a step. The moves are simple enough for beginners, yet slightly more complex for the advanced person. "
dvd,12 of 12,5.0,An extremely underrated movie,"Althoush critics and pretty much everyone else dismissed this movie as awful, I think it is great.  It is Denis Laery at his best both in acting and writing.  The dialouge between him and a young Sandra Bullock is  excellent.  You get to see his Boston/Irish side like in other in Monument  Ave but in a better plot with better actors. (Although his art theif  sidekicks do have some great one-liners)  Sandra Bullock is also an  excellent sidekick to Leary.  She made this movie before she was a star in  movies such a Speed, but plays a her &quot;wanting to get out of the  gutter&quot; character great.   This movie will not be loved by everyone,  but serious Leary fan or Bullock aficionado will appreciate its merit.    Finally, any Homicide fans will enjoy seeing &quot;G&quot; Yaphet Kotto in  a less dramatic law enforcement role"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Too wonderful,"I watched the Renoir version and the Kurosawa version back-to-back one night and TRULY enjoyed both.  Renoir mentions in the booklet that was wasn't too pleased with the performances of some of the actors, but I enjoyed their portrayal of the characters.  Even though both movies draw from the same play - they are different - I am biased towards the Kurosawa version as being superior.  However, I wouldn't be alone as Renoir even remarked after watching Kurosawa's film, ""that is a much more important film than mine."""
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,An Excellent Film: And A Very Unpredictable Ending!,"There are countless reviews here, so I will make this one short. First, I am always amazed when I meet people who say they figured ""The Usual Suspects"" out by the middle of the movie. I for one was totally floored. I did not see it coming, and was very surprised [no spoilers]. The film has been analyzed, dissected, discussed, and with over 500 reviews, written about quite extensively. However, one of the things I don't understand is why someone would give the film one or two stars. There are many 'good' films that have really never appealed to me, however, I can see that although I might not like the film, it is a good film. Therefore, I would not think of giving such low marks to film for this reason; but would give my analysis of what I thought was weak about a film: Yet, I would still give the film its earned accolades. This film was great however."
dvd,7 of 28,5.0,Extremely  funny!,I like this dvd from SNL. I love the cartoons! TV Funhouse did a good job on them. Now I can see all my favorite of TV Funhouse in a dvd! SNL did a good job! I highly reccomend this dvd from SNL
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,Waste of time,"I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe. "

dvd,1 of 2,4.0,good quality horror from master Sam Raimi,"According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a ""stain"" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later."
dvd,2 of 3,2.0,An arid technical exercise and not nearly as funny as it thinks it is,"Despite liking a couple of his movies, I've never been a fan of Preston Sturges, and a second viewing of Unfaithfully Yours did nothing to change that. With rare exceptions like Frasier or Comme une Image, most supposedly `sophisticated' comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are: this definitely falls into the latter category. It may be slightly more articulate, but it still comes down to pratfalls and clich�s clumsily dispensed (not to mention an incredibly one-dimensional role for Linda Darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband). Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film, Rex Harrison is entirely wrong for the part: aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film, he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy, which renders what could and should have been a great comic setpiece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted. (Alfred Newman's surprisingly crudely over the top slide-whistle and horn 'comic' underscoring all but stones the scene to death, a surprising lapse of judgment from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music.) In the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold, but instead it's almost reduced to a technical exercise."
dvd,,5.0,Love love love this vidoe,"I bought this video for my 2-year old triplets and I have to say it was a great trip down Sesame Street Memory Lane for me...it has all my favorite sesame street songs - including ""do the rubber duck"" and ""the aligator king with his 7-sons"" and of course - ""Sing a song"".  We watch it to death  - my kids always ask for this video"
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,From the end to the beginning,"Memento is a movie you have to watch again to fully understand the roots of the story behind Lenard Shelby (Guy Pierce) and his relationships with Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) & Teddy/John Gamel (Joe Pantoliano).  Lenard has a condition in this movie where he has no short-term memory (not amnesia though).  He can only remember things for about 10 minutes and then everything fades so he has to take pictures of things he needs/wants to remember and for the important things, he has them tattooed on his own body.  He is trying to find the guy who raped and murdered his wife and you are shown a lovely picture at the beginning of the movie that shows a picture (won't say too much to ruin things for readers of this review who have not seen the movie and are interested) of Teddy shot in the head, but you don't know why this happened and the movie begins its sequences of going backwards in 10-12 minute sequences then moving into no-color sequences where Lenard talks more about his condition.  Be sure that you have full concentration as you will need it.  Overall, great movie"

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Jane Grey fan,"I own this film on VHS and it's one of the jewels of my collection.  I've been a Tudor fan and a Lady Jane Grey fan ever since I watched ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" on CBS in the summer of 1971.  I first saw ""Lady Jane"" in 1986 in the theater and never forgot it.  Yes, the movie's not accurate in its depiction of Jane Grey and Guilford Dudley, but I was so happy to finally see a movie about her that it didn't bother me, and the couple's ultimate fate was devastating; it resonated deeply with me.  I loved the film then and I love it now (especially with Patrick Stewart in a supporting role as Jane's father, Duke Henry Grey)"
dvd,,5.0,FOURTH  VOLUME A SUCCESS,"This, the fourth volume of Warner's remastered Looney Tunes DVD series, is the best one since the first. Like on the previous three sets, each disc is themed and kicks off with a Bugs Bunny disc. The Bugs Bunny disc alone is worth the price of the set, and is arguably the best Bugs collection yet. Unlike the previous two collections, we are not swamped with the Ted-Turner owned pre-1948 cartoons, but rather with the classic post-1948 films. Fans who grew up with the BUGS BUNNY/ROAD RUNNER SHOW on CBS (such as myself) will find many memories here: ""Roman Legion-Hare,"" ""Rabbit Hood"", ""Mississippi Hare,"" ""Sahara Hare"" etc."
dvd,,5.0,Queer As Folk- The Fifth Season,I love this show and am so glad it ended the way it did.  Look out for Rosie
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,One of my favorites for all the wrong reasons,"Yes, yes.  This movie is campy as all get out.  The plot is barely held together with acrylic glue, but darn it if Kate and Matt aren't too cute for words.  If (and in Hollywood-this isn't out of the realm of possibility) these two were ever to get together they would produce babies beautiful enough to rival Brad and Angelina's pending bundle of joy.  Overall, the movie packs a lot of laughs and did I mention the actors were cute? Recommended"
dvd,1 of 5,4.0,More entertaining than you might think,"The title Kindergarten Cop is in reference to the main character, John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a cop who goes undercover as a nursery school teacher to catch the bad guy. A key teaching aid for Kimble is his pet ferret, whom he takes with him wherever he goes (he loves his ferret so much, he doesn't even bother to name it - such devotion!). The children are captivated by the diminutive sable mustelid, and eventually learn to calm down and listen to their new teacher. Best of all, the fiesty ferret saves the day, helping Kimble catch the baddie (Richard Tyson). "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,if you have to watch a romance movie with your girl,"get this one! I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend but after only maybe 10-15 minutes I was really interested in seeing what happened next. I have been forced to watch a few other romance films in my time and this one I actually enjoyed. If your girl has given you a list of romance movies she wants for gifts and you know your going to end up having to watch them with her, do yourself a favor and get this"
dvd,1 of 8,4.0, Choose SOmething !,"This movie is completely sick , a total gross out no holds barred film about heroin addiction, the way it should be. Heroin is not chic nor glamorous as is neither drug addiction, but the movie is sharp, fast and funny.  The cast is great and the SOundtrack as well. Drugstore Cowboy with techno"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,grief in all its forms,"Brilliant. When her husband goes missing, Marie (the exquisite Charlotte Rampling, who has elevated the composed, cool woman with underlying problems to an art form) will not relent in her search. When he is clearly gone, she will not fully let go or move on. She lives in a state of psychological limbo in which she lets others acknowledge the loss while she neither confirms, denies or believes what is clear. Her involvements in life after the loss of her husband are tainted by the memory of her husband, who for her is still quite real. Her grief, instead of traveling the normal path of eventual acceptance, drives her further into a madness born of denial."

dvd,,4.0,Jane Austen adaptation hits the mark,"If you enjoy reading Jane Austen novels or watching films like Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and more, Sense and Sensibility is for you.  Adapted by Emma Thompson and directed by Ang Lee (later to direct the acclaimed Brokeback Mountain) the film is beautiful, touching, and more true to the book than most films based on novels. "
dvd,0 of 1,1.0,Pieces Of a Puzzle ,"Ju-On the grudge is about a horrific murder that develops an un-rested spirit which rages in a small suburban house in Japan.  The movie constructs itself similar to a puzzled storyline as the movie developed through numerous storylines of the varying characters.  For the most part, viewers can easily be confused in the flick, or bored, as it may seem a bit redundant.  I thought the movie was well written and interesting in theory.  In practice, the movie felt never-ending, and as it drew to a close, i felt betrayed.  The movie was unfulfilled, as it never really explained a lot of questions I held at the end.  One question that leaves me wondering is questioning whether it is a Japanese custom to enter a house when no one answers.  For those interested in Asian horror, try Tale of Two Sisters.  This Korean film has great cinematography and story line.  It will leave you on edge and taken back at its close."
dvd,5 of 11,5.0,"Looney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Two",Excellent choice for anyone who is a true Looney Tunes Fan
dvd,5 of 8,5.0,one of johnny's best,"I adore this movie. Shows you that love, true love, is possible at any age. And, it can last forever! I recommend this to any romantic out there.. young and old alike"
dvd,,5.0,Defining a generation?,`Clueless' is probably the equivalent of `The Breakfast Club' for the 90's generation.  I went to school with these kids; sadly...I was one of these kids.  `Clueless' is also one of the smartest comedies to come out in the 90's for it capitalized on everything that made teenagers of that era funny and stupid.  The 90's was a much easier time.  Now we have films like `thirteen' (probably the best film to come out in 2003) to describe life as a teenager...life today is just so much darker than I remember it growing up.
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Just the right length,Great movie! Simple to understand.  It's not long and drawn out like many movies today; it was interesting all the way through and has a good message
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,Strength + Flexibility = Yoga Power!,"Karen Voight's YOGA POWER is really two yoga workouts in one: Yoga Strength, which utilizes a number of challenging yoga poses to build strength and stamina; and Yoga Stretch, which consists of a series of gentle stretches to increase flexibility.  "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,A must for all you hard working men and women,"What an awesome movie with great performances from a stellar cast. This is also a for the salesman, by the salesman and an of the salesman movie. Any salesman struggling in this dog-eat-dog world of competition and survival will instantly identify with the characters of the film. Working people anywhere will also make an instant connection to this movie. "
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Absolutely beautiful,"I bought this movie without ever seeing it.  As I started to watch it I got caught up in the story line, this movie is a beautiful story about first love and true love.  The actors, script and overall feel of the movie are amazing.  The two main characters Tori and Paulie do such a wonderful job that it is hard to remember that it is only a movie and that they are not truly in love.  But if you are looking for a movie with a happy ending this is not one to see.  I of course had no idea what the movie was about and when I got to the end I was very upset about the ending.  This movie is a amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone"
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,Glamorous Girlmores!,"The Forth Season of gilmore girls had me hooked and in a trance for about a week. I watched it over and over again and i still do. It left you with a really big cliff hanger at the end so naturally, i had to get the 5th season"
dvd,,5.0,A Great Collection of Episodes,"24 season three is plentiful with plot nice twists and turns, many of which end up as a great series. This aspect proves to be both a strength and a weakness. Watching the entire season in such a brief period of time, I noticed how it is clearly divided between two stories, while the plot twists proved to be natural and compelling during the first story. Regardless of any flaws, 24-season Three is the best television series I have ever seen. Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer instantly stands out as a great character trying to do whats right, while also struggling to keep his family safe"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Hilarious,"Two people made this moving hilarious:  Zaboo and Vince Vaughn.  Although I'm a huge Travolta fan, these two supporting characters kept me in stitches.  Cedric the Entertainer also added to the success of this movie."
dvd,,4.0,Highly entertaining,"This movie, although the story is unreal, is highly entertaining and well worth watching. I love the fact that the two girls are so different. One is so sure of herself and her sexuality and the other is slowly awakening. The scene were the mother enters the bedroom and goes crazy finding the two girls in bed together is a hoot"
dvd,,5.0,Excellent show,"I missed the entire season when it was aired on TV but got to see it with the DVD. The show is very addictive and I was able to watch each episode multiple times without getting bored. That according to me, is a good criterion for purchasing the DVD for a TV show, movie or music album"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,A very thorough documentary,Anyone who has followed the Iraq war closely and is somewhat grounded in reality should have known before seeing this documentary that the Bush administration lied to justify their war in Iraq and that they are now lying to cover up the lies that they already told. 
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Funniest Legal Film and John Hurt's most disturbing role,"This is an odd film.  It contains some of the most funny moments a courtroom has ever seen (""a hearing to decide the admissability of the word 'ass'?  I love it!"") combined with one of the most distrubing psycho portrayls I've seen.  John Hurt is magnificently unnerving in his acting, while Judd manages to carry some of the most memorable courtroom antics ever.  And I didn't even mention the DA's dildo..."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,An entertaining film,"I saw this movie when it came out originally and enjoyed it thoroughly. Although totally fictitious, it is an excellent production. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,40 year old guy loves this movie,"Well, I rented this movie for my seven year old step-daughter because I grew up on Curious George and wanted to share that adventure with her. As well, she only speaks spanish and this movie has a spanish language track. I watched the movie before her to hear it in english. I tell you, I was swept in from the DVD menu. This is an absolutely adorable movie, from the animation, the voices of Wil Ferrel and others, to the music, to the way too cute Curious George, to the wonderful feel of the story. There are even some nice lessons about honesty and love. Personally, I loved this movie, and I'm 40 years old. The spanish voice overs were very well done as well, and my daughter also loved the movie, although I laughed out loud more often than her. I'll be waiting for the sequel."
dvd,8 of 10,1.0,"Great show, but I won't be buying Season 1","EDITED?!?!?  No thanks.  I'd GLADLY pay for the original, uncut episodes on DVD (along with the ""Golden Girls"", ""Roseanne"" was/is one of my all time favorite TV series), but there is no way I'm going to buy this set."
dvd,,5.0,I need to be in a 24-step program--I'm addicted!,"I saw the first 2 seasons in Nairobi, Kenya in 4 days.  I followed up in the US with Season 3, renting it 6 episodes at a time.  When Amazon finally made Season 4 available, I was the first on my block to own it, and our family did a ""24--Season 4"" marathon over the Christmas/Hanukkah holiday.  I have since gotten several friends addicted.  What a blessing to have something so well produced and intense to take my mind off my own fairly dull life!  Although I'm watching Season 5 on TV every Monday, there is nothing like these commercial-free videos."

dvd,1 of 1,2.0,Just kept getting worse and worse....,"I loved the early M*A*S*H episodes.  Equally intelligent, humane, cynical, sardonic, and just right out hilarious, they were some of the best television ever produced.  Unfortunately, the show moved away from this formula (which worked amazingly well) to the latter day formula.  The show became overly preachy, annoying, incredibly sanctimonious, politically correct, badly acted, badly written, pretentious, and downright silly at times.  The show ran for 11 seasons, and with all sitcoms that run too long, it quickly ran out of juice.  But that doesn't excuse the poor quality of the shows from 1975 onwards.  Hawkeye and BJ's characters became incredibly annoying, especially Hawkeye and his constant flirting with nurses.  It was funny early on, but as he aged, it became more and more childish.  Alda's acting is way over the top in these later seasons.  Since he was the one running the show for all intended purposes, I suppose no one told him to tone it down.  Charles is really the only intelligent and sympathetic character here, and the one I like the most.  You're not supposed to like him because of his ""blue blood"" upbringing, but you do anyway, because Hawkeye and BJ are so damn irritating.  You would think that BJ and Hawkeye wouldn't be so naive sometimes about things, considering they've been in a war now for years.  Soldiers are very jaded, cynical people, and with good reason.  They don't get more naive as time progresses.  The early episodes had Hawkeye much more jaded than in these later ones, and it should be the other way around.  Watch the first 3 seasons (except when Henry gets killed, which was just done for cheap shock value).  Those were the best..."

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Great show.  Terrific plot and action.,Very entertaining.  You can find some plot faults but at the end of the day this is simply good entertainment for those of us that like fast moving shows and like to see the good guys win
dvd,,4.0,"Good fun, if you don't moralize about it...","Melanie is great to look at, and easy to root for, in this cutthroat business competition story. Harrison Ford takes a rare third place in importance, because Sigourney Weaver, as the villain, steals every scene she is in, and really makes the movie successful. Essentially a comedy, this one makes you think about ethics in the workplace, and it isn't just Sigourney who cuts corners in that realm. Many similar plot lines have been filmed, but few have succeeded as much as this one. Repeat screenings are still fun, and that's a rare compliment for me."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,the last collaboration between Kurosawa and Mifune,"This 1965 film is the story of a young doctor under the tutelage a compassionate but strict country doctor.  It was Kurosawa's last black & white film and also, sadly, the last film he did with Toshiro Mifune, who plays the title character, the man who runs a clinic for the poor.  Yasumoto, the arrogant and self-absorbed young doctor, resents being sent to this backward place, but as the action unfolds he learns more about the people wo need help and more about what it means to be a doctor.  Exactly halfway through the film Yatsumo dons the robes of a clinic doctor, having decided that Red Beard is a worthy mentor.  We also learn the stories of several patients in depth, and these are heartbreaking."
dvd,7 of 12,1.0,"""Who would want to kill the sweetest ****** woman in the world?""","I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, ""Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"""
dvd,,4.0,Lowbrow humor at it's best,"If you're looking for laughs without being challenged, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours. It's not ground breaking, it's just funny. Watch Meet the Press to rev your brain back up after this one"
dvd,,5.0,Great Value,"Not even 9 bucks a film you can't go wrong.  I only wanted 3-4 titles, but each individually would be more than the value of this set - Dial M, North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, and The Wrong Man are must have themselves and would cost about $80 individually, so this set's a GREAT VALUE - it's like saving a few bucks on a few classic Hitchcocks you want to buy and getting 5-6 other films for free almost - never even knew of some of these until buying this set, great way to spend a rainy/boring night. "
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,"A great movie, with non-stop hilarity!","Sam Stone (played by Danny DeVito), millionaire women's clothing mogul, is tired of his fat, irritating wife Barbara (Bette Midler), and is ready to murder her. But, when he finds out that she has been kidnapped, and will be murdered if anything goes wrong, all of his dreams have come true. Ken Kessler (Judge Rienhold) and his wife Sandy (Helen Slater) were ripped off by Sam, and figure that by kidnapping Barbara, and getting Sam's money that they would be even, but they wouldn't hurt a fly. Sam's mistress Carol (Anita Morris) has a boy toy of her own and wants to get her hands on Sam's money. Also, there's a cold-blooded murderer stalking L.A. and he could be anywhere. Oh oh, this could get complicated...and hilarious!"
dvd,8 of 12,5.0,Bold and original...!,"Nominated for 17 Emmys in its short four-year stint, In Living Color is widely considered the best skit comedy show since SNL. Created by the multitalented star Keenen Ivory Wayans (the eldest child from a large and talented family), the 30-minute TV show became an instant hit for emerging big network competitor FOX in the spring of 1990. Showcasing the talents of the Wayans family (especially blockbuster talent Damon Wayans), along with initial cast members David Alan Grier, Tommy Davidson, Kim Coles, T'keyah ""Crystal"" Keymah, Kelly Coffield, and Jim Carrey (who would use the show as a springboard to smash hit movie career that would begin with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in 1994), In Living Color quickly achieved the status of TV cult icon..."
dvd,,5.0,Excellent movie about one of the best,This is my favorite movie about a musician (my 2nd favorite being Walk the Line).  Jamie Foxx does an outstanding job playing the part of Ray Charles.  The movie covers Ray's rise to stardom flashing back occasionally to his childhood when Ray lost his brother at an early age and then shortly after began to go blind.  It also covers very well how Ray's mother had a positive influence on his life and how she insisted he be strong and assertive in spite of his blindness.

dvd,15 of 15,5.0,"Must Have Bond, James Bond","This collection includes various Bond movies from four of the actors that have played James Bond in the ""official"" Bond movies, which excludes ""Never Say Never Again.""  My only complaint about the three collections is that the movies are not in order.  I have all three sets because I like Bond rather than wanting all the Bond movies by one of the three actors.  However, you have to take them as you can get them sometimes."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Better than I remember,"I bought the set and was very surprised to find that the episodes were much better than I remember them.  I have to admit that they do not compare with the early All in the Family episodes, but neither do the later All in the Family episodes.  But none the less, I am glad they are on DVD and am glad that I purchased them.  Does anyone know if the second season will be available soon"

dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Brutal and enthralling yet touching,"There's an often-used joke when it comes down to Quentin Tarantino: that pick any film and he probaly had something to do with it. ""Written, Directed, Starring and Catered by Quentin Tarantino"" for an example, since he's responsible for bringing to stateside such films as Hero and Hostel. While I did enjoy Hero, even if it felt like Crouching Tiger Part 2 and less said about Hostel the better, Oldboy was often mentioned as the one good film he had his name on. Checking it out, I found they were quite right as its one of the better foreign films I've seen."

dvd,1 of 3,5.0,The Sopranos is one of the best shows around! ,"I love the packaging of the Sopranos dvd sets. Its so much better then the cheap plastic packaging the Sex and the City individual sets got. I wish they put more bonus features on the Sopranos, but the dvds are high quality and I love this show. I am hoping that at the series end they do a gift collection of the Sopranos like they did for Sex and the City."

Have seen it several times before buying the DVD and the impact of the story line and the underlying threads of ongoing prejudice in 21st century America become smore and more glaring and disturbing.

dvd,,5.0,Great for bonding and learning,"Of all of the Baby Einstein's my grandson loves Galileo the best, and has not tired of since first enjoying it at around 8 months.  When he watches he looks back and forth from the video to me with a huge smile and look of wonder, giving us a great opportunity to bond and learn.  The little kangaroo kid is so funny and makes little noises rather than words to express himself and his mommy is so loving, always there for a hug or reassurance! The 'plot' is well played out, moving through different areas of sky explorations.  The photography is absolutely stunning and the music is perfect for a young child.  I can't recommend this video enough.  To this day, my grandson is thrilled when he hears ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" (making a star twinkle with his hands) and can even pick this song out when it is revised or used with different words.

dvd,,5.0,Timeless humor,"If you, or anyone you know is struck with the dream of acquiring a trailer for the fun-filled fancy-free experience of traveling all around the country to camp, sight-see, fish and to enjoy all the other care-free experiences that follow, then this movie should be a ""must-see"" before any purchase is made.  But do it only if you can laugh at yourself. Watch this movie not as a warning, but watch it to peer into the proverbial crystal ball to see what could happen, and usually does, when someone wanders into a boat show, car show, home improvement show, etc., and buys something that seems so perfect at the time, but ends up being one of the worst decisions ever. I'm guilty of this. Life is filled with bumps that make our dreams go off-course, and this movie is all about this, as told from a first-person narrative (initially) after a husband and wife buy an RV trailer.  This movie is hilarious, and although the movie is from the 50's, the humor can be easily related to life today. Lucille Ball falls in love with a lovely trailer and also falls for the ""perfect dream"" of camping and traveling and living the ""good life"" that awaits all RV-ers. She convinces her husband to join the ""dream"" so they buy the dream trailer. The movie follows their many bumps of trailer life that almost causes a divorce. How many people, when traveling on vacation, collect things like cups, shot glasses, etc. to remember their visits?  Lucille Ball does one better.  She collects rocks (virtual boulders) and fills the trailer with them, and the scenes of Desi Arnaz trying to maneuver their 30ft, overweight trailer up and over the Rockies afterwards is worth the purchase price. This is a beautiful transfer.  After writing this, I've got to watch the movie again"

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Dick Van Dyke Rocks!,"Thats all their is too it.  Dick Van Dyke rocks!  I love this show. I still watch it sometimes on I TV.  The earlier seasons are the best, with Dr. Jack Stewart being played by Jack Baio(think thats right)when Jesse Travis comes in, played by Charlie Schlatter(hope thats right)the episodes seem to focus more on scandals and boring politics.  They are still fun to watch, BUT not as fun as the beginning episodes.  You can tell the cast is just having a great time in each scene.  "

dvd,1 of 1,2.0,Kind of loses steam very quickly,"Even though it's used by a lot of reviewers, I have to use it too. The opening scene has John Travolta staring into the camera delivering a monologue about how Hollywood creates **** lately. He mentions that it would be great if the bad guy got away in the end, then later in the film he talks about Harry Houdini and misdirection. Oddly, this film was produced by Joel Silver, who I can list as a creator, or at least a deliverer, of said Hollywood ****. There's only 3 reasons really to watch this film, none of which have anything to do with the story, which shows you just how the film is."
dvd,,4.0,"Funny, Pleasant way for relaxation",I work in a very busy dental office and things get crazy and hectic there. What I loved about scrubs is it reminds you of sittuations you have experienced before and how you would have liked to handled them but didn't dare.
dvd,,4.0,Refreshingly Different!,"I think that Denise Austin fans will find this video to be a little bit different from her other videos, but in a good way. This video combines some yoga, standing pilates and ends with a fun little 10-minute dance workout just to loosen you up. This video is good for those days when you want to exercise but you're just not up for traditional cardio or toning routines. A good ""rainy day"" video!"
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Magnifcient!,"Now on a Two Disc DVD, Walt Disney's Masterpiece ""Cinderella"" now fully restored to new enchanting brilliance. The legendary animated film is packed with alots of bonus features, I love Disney, so this is a great film. The Beloved story of a widowed man's daughter named Cinderella who is forced to live with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters after her father's death, living as a low status girl doing maid work all time with only delightful mice for friends, but her luck changes when a royal ball is annouced by the king for his son, Prince Charming to meet the girl of his dreams and with a fairy godmother and a left behind glass slipper, Cinderella and Charming live happily ever after. It's a landmark film in animation, it's a delight for all ages, they don't make em like they used to. See Walt Disney's ""Cinderella"
dvd,10 of 11,4.0,Mostly Great Collection,"I think we should all just pretend that John Hughes died tragically in 1990, shortly after working on the brilliant ""Uncle Buck.""  He was not at all involved in such films as ""Baby's Day Out"" or ""Home Alone 3.""  He did, however, make several great movies in the 1980s, including ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Weird Science,"" the films enclosed in this lovely collection."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Great Chess Movie but so much more!,"Not really a movie about Bobby Fischer, but rather the drive in the chess community to find the next prodigy who will take the Chess world by storm."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Finally!,"I am so glad to see that some of the lesser known 80's movies are coming out on DVD. Though these movies are good on their own, I don't understand why they are not being released with extra features such as interviews with the actors of these great movies. Fans of these movies would like to know what these actors are up to today and their personal thoughts of these movies. If you like this movie, then you will also like ""Just One of the Guys"", another lesser known movie but again it lacks the special features. Thankfully, these movies are good enough to stand on there own but the bonus features would be nice. Enjoy and any other suggestions for lesser known 80's movies would be appreciated by all I am sure"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,An Excellent Workout,"I decided to try this DVD after signing up for a step class that was fun and challenging but also very dancy.  This is a great workout- the moves are athletic rather than dance, and you learn so many of the basic steps.  Although the choreography was fairly simple, you will still get a great workout.  Be ready to sweat. "
dvd,4 of 12,5.0,Para Los Fan�ticos Del New Wave,"Son dos discos de coleccin, con los videos de las mejores canciones de esta banda inglesa, en el primer disco vienen los videos incluyendo los ltimos como Krafty!!!...lo que si es una lstima es que el documental incluido en el segundo disco no tenga subttulos...bueno, en resumen si eres fantico de esta banda y te gusta la onda new wave...que esperas"
dvd,,4.0,The Eye 2...,"I caught this movie on cable 02/03/2006.  I am not squeamish, but this movie definitely had scenes that made me that way!  The story in itself was interesting, but man-oh-man, the special effects used definitely got under this man's skin.  Shu Qi deserves a special mention here, for she portrayed a woman with a tortured soul effectively.  Folks, if you have a soft heart (or stomach, or soul...), this is probably a movie that you should pass on.  But, if you want a movie that makes your skin crawl just a bit, then look no further than ""The Eye 2."" Interesting work from Hong Kong!  Four Stars!"
dvd,0 of 15,1.0,The film deserves NO credit. Disney thinks that people are too stupid to read the great stories that they changed.,"I am so mad at Disney and their movie ""Hercules"" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention. "
dvd,0 of 18,1.0,"Fatalism, responsibility, blame others, for one's own life...","When I sit down in the theater to watch a film I start with a neutral rating of zero so that the movie itself can then take me up the star rating, or down.  I rate differently than most.  I do it, for my purposes, in a much better way.  Trust me.  You should try it. Start out neutral then be mutable.  Go up or down with your rating as the movie progresses.  At the end of the day you will come up with what is a personally more accurate composite rather than a final, less step-by-step derived method of judgment.  If only waiting until the end to state your case, much of your case cannot be stated. You will come up with a more accurate impression if the film is evaluated as you go. Very important also, is the type of rating.  Never limit yourself to the typical zero-to-five star confinement.  Always allow yourself a much more realistic range of from a minus ten stars, up to a plus ten stars, or at the very least, a negative five up ten to a plus five stars.  You will like it better, personally.  You know very well you have seen a movie where zero stars is simply not low enough."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,JEAN-CLAUDE VANDAMME ROCKS IN THIS URBAN ACTION SPECTACLE!!!,Wow!!! What an amazing film!!! Vandamme gives a knockout performance in this finely directed film!!! Sheldon Lettich has outdone the expectations for this movie with a final product that is WAY ABOVE par for a DTV action film. Character development that far surpasses that of most films of this genre. The action scenes were quite nice and this movie left nothing to be yerned for. Awesome!!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!! Worthy of Theatrical release for sure!!!!
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"""The Point Is Not Minding That It Hurts""","This quote comes from Lawrence early in the film and it shows us that this story is basically a character study of Lawrence, which also applies to many other great warriors, explorers and others who confront great physical and psychological hardship while attempting to accomplish great and important things.  Lawrence states this when he puts out at match by snuffing it out with his fingers, seemlingly with ease.  When another soldier tries out he winces in pain and comments that it hurts.  Lawrence gives this reply."
dvd,4 of 9,2.0,Stop after season 3,"The care and attention given to character and relationship development in seasons 1-3 are gone from 4-5.  Silly plots, many based on 1980s trends, i.e.: divorce rates, bored housewives in rebellion, aerobics, consumerism made my eyes roll.  The suburban episode was the worst-the first Asian characters on the series were Japanese tourists with big cameras and lo and behold, latent martial arts skills that came in handy at the end. It's like season 4 was all about being campy, and I missed the good writing.  It was such a different direction for the show than in previous seasons. The romance element is inexplicably headed backwards- the character of Laura Holt has practically become an ice queen and Remington is left to make cheesy passes and be happy with a goodnight kiss.  What was up with Laura-abuse in the last Season 4 episode?  Meanwhile, the writers seemed to turn their interest towards beautifying Mildred who has had a fashion transformation. She also delivers one-liners every time she opens her mouth.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,more classic humor,"this is one of the best pairs of 'true comedians' and this box set provides hours of humor.  you need to have a good sense of humor, or at least appreciate lots of physical abuse"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Just about perfect in all respects...,"Race and crime are the topics of this adaptation of Harper Lee's mega-selling novel. Set in the pre-World War II south, filmed in black and white, starring two child actors who were totally unknown and the wonderful Gregory Peck, the movie is really a tale of a single dad small-town lawyer raising a boy and a girl to do the right things and think the right thoughts. Famous for many things, the movie features a child character based on Truman Capote, and a mysterious neighbor played by Robert Duvall in his film debut. The music and cinematography are both superb. Everyone over the age of 12 should see this film at least once"
dvd,,5.0,The Book of Acts Video,"A very good portrayal of the book of Acts, very true to the scriptures and a great visual aid.  My church has greatly enjoyed viewing and discussing this video.  I highly recommend it. "
dvd,1 of 7,1.0,Worst anime tv show I had seen in a few years,The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked. 
dvd,,5.0,What is this - a trench coat convention?,"This is without a doubt, one of Harrison Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it"
dvd,5 of 28,2.0,CONSTIPATED CELLULOID,"Is there anyone more pretentious than this guy? Oh yeah, Wim Wenders comes to mind."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Shark Tale (Widescreen Edition)  ~ Will Smith,"Shark Tale (Widescreen Edition)~ Will Smith is an amazing animated movie with a awesome plot, great characters, good music and witty and intelligent dialogue. I love the spin on the God father. Will Smith is great as the fish Oscar who wants to live the good life and tries to trick people into believing that he is a shark slayer with a sham of a shark killing where the victim is his cooperating partner in the scheme rather then being the victim of Oscars prowess. This movie is one of the best animated movies that I have seen in quite some time and I definitely without reservation can rank as high as movies such as Finding Nemo, Land before time and Lion King. Highly Recommended"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,A great 2-DVD release of the classic concert + extras!!!,"It took a while for this classic concert to be released on DVD but it was well worth it!!! Rhino gives this concert the royal treatment on 2 DVD's!!! Disc 1 has the classic ""The Concert For Bangladesh"" and Disc 2 has the extras!!! Great sound too!!! Also includes a nice booklet!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A"
dvd,12 of 12,4.0,Watching Nightmares,"What a wonderfully bizarre thriller this is!  Annette Benning's performance alone makes it worth watching - but there is still so much more. The story is so unsettling you never quiet get your grip once the film starts moving.  From the opening credits - where a ghost town becomes submerged as a reservoir to the jump-out-of-your-seat ending, this one is a real keeper.  The photography and set pieces are absolutely beautiful and do much put the viewer in Benning's head.  A wild, frightening trip"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Bottom line - it's entertaining.,"I have to say, I enjoyed watching this movie - it is definitely entertaining and the special effects are great.  However, for reasons I won't get into here (this is a movie review, not a discussion on global warming) -the ideas in this movie are far fetched.  Having said that, it is still very entertaining. To me, that's what makes the film worth watching -not whether it's a good commentary on current society, reflects what's politically correct or popular at the time, blah blah blah.  When I crave that, I watch a documentary.  If you're looking just to sit back and enjoy a movie--this movie provides that.  If you're looking for something more, you probably won't find it here. Besides - looking at Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal is never a bad thing!"
dvd,21 of 23,2.0,"I worked on this dull ""erotic vampire"" film -- some ""inside scoops""!","Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' ""exploitation"" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film."
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,Solid...,"This is a solid and realistic film about a deviant female who finds  a legitimate to deal with inner anger through boxing.  I enjoyed this film for three reasons: 1) the acting was solid, 2) the story was realistic and did not go all Hollywood on me, and 3) I liked the ending and the gender struggles portrayed.  A film worth watching"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Pleased with Gift,This item was a gift for my father.  He was very pleased with the quick shipment and just loves the movie!  Thank you
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The Best Yet,"I have seen a variety of documentaries and could not recommend anything better. I was drawn to this film as I am training to work with children with special needs. However, I witnessed an entire room captivated by this film. Not a dry eye in the place. The emotions evoked from this film are remarkable. It provides viewers the opportunity to experience life with the Tom family--and gain a new perspective of living life to the fullest. I promise this film will leave every viewer with something special"

dvd,8 of 12,5.0,A Devine DVD,Really interesting DVD.  I couldn't believe NBC News put this out... but then again I'm not surprised because of the terrific storytelling. 
dvd,,5.0,How To Steal A MIllion,"I adore this film. It's so cute,and O'Toole and Hepburn gives hilarious performances. It's all about a young girl {Hepburn} who's father's best talent is forging art by the masters. He sells a forged statue for a million dollars to a museum in Paris,and Audrey decides to steal it back before her father is found out,with a little help from thief Peter O'Toole,not knowing that he's really a private eye in fake art! It's so funny,and you'll be laughing from beginning to end. It's directed very stylishly,but if you take the film seriously,it won't be any fun. You just have to sit back and think of nothing and watch it. The bio on the DVD about Audrey is a nice little film for Audrey collectors,and the ability to flip to scene to scene is really swell. I give this film 5 stars. You're sure to love it"
dvd,,4.0,it's the first one.  what do you expect?,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books."
dvd,,5.0,What can be said.. they're U2.,"If you know U2 at all, you know that they are one of the most successful rock bands of all time, and their concerts are always amazing. "
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Karas--The Prophecy,"I'm very picky aobut my anime; it has to have the perfect voices, i have to like the animation, and the colouring. This anime fit the mold excellently. It has the right amount of adventure to quench my thirst for it. The voices are superb (alot of the voice talent i didn't know it was them until the credits). The anime was beautifully done. The CG couldn't have been done better. The whole anime was intense had me rooting for everyone (except for the bad guys). And the storyline.... *looks dreamy* WOW!"
dvd,9 of 11,4.0,A drama poem with scenes from nature,"The Holy Mountain is considered one of the best Bergfilms (mountain movies) ever, and the final scene ""His world"", in which we see the allucination of the protagonist, as he dies up high on a mountain, is an absolute masterpiece. The movie is interesting for several reasons. The dancing of Leni Riefenstahl, the new music of Aljoscha Zimmermann (a real pity the original soundtrack of Edmund Meisel has been lost), the experimentation with blue light, and the gorgeous images from the Alps. It is somewhat interesting to note that the initial dance scene (Diotima on the sea) had originally been thought for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, something almost impossible to fathom."

dvd,,4.0,COMPROMISED BUT CONSIDERABLE!,"Even though, this DVD version of Burn! have been considerably butchered and compromised, it still retains its value from a historical point of view. Gillo Pontecorvo's original Burn! (Queimada) is without a doubt a magnificent account of the slave revolt against colonialism in the Caribbean in the late 18th century. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Drop Dead Hilarious!,"Drop Dead Gorgeous has been a favorite of mine for years now. I can't even believe how underappreciated this movie was! For shame! It is filmed in the style of a documentary, but it's not real. But the documentary style makes it so different from the same old stuff we see over and over. Throughout the movie, we follow the lives of the girls of Mount Rose as they enter a beauty pageant. Kirsten Dunst is absolutely amazing in this movie. Other incredible performances are given by Ellen Barkin as Kirsten Dunst's white trash mom (""Bring me my smokes!""). You can't help but root for Kirsten's character the entire time, despite you'll love to hate Denise Richards as the daughter of Kirstie Alley, who is in charge of the pageant this year and wants her daughter to win. "
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,The Dreamers , I thought the acting and the cinematography where great. This is defiantly a well-made charter driven movie made in Paris. It reflected what was happing there during the late sixties as the background to the story of an American student studing in Paris who meets up with two locals a brother and sister and they become more than just friends
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,"Amazing, adult swim at it's finest","Really funny, if you like any adult swim cartoons, funny comedy skits, or just have an open sense of humor, you'll love this DVD"
dvd,12 of 12,1.0,I want a good copy! ,"""Way Out West"" is my favorite Stan & Ollie film. It is consistantly clever; the horse on the balcony, the head under the pail, the bodies in the piano, and of course, the delightful dance sequence. Alas, I sold my really fine VHS version, expecting someone to eventually give justice to this fun romp. When do you think someone, even Criterion, will wake up and realize that quality entertainment cannot be compromised, and a loving public will not settle for mediocrity?"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,The perfect drama for high school students,"The O.C is a melodramatic series which revolves around the drama of a group of teenagers in Newport. It begins with Ryan arriving to Newport from Chino, when successful attorney Sandy Cohen decides to invite him into his home after defending him in a case. Sandy's son Seth becomes grateful for Ryan's sudden arrival as Summer, Seth's childhood crush begins to finally notice him. Ryan develops a relationship with rich girl, Marissa and the show becomes very dramatic, touching on all matters, ranging from complicated family issues to emotional break ups. There are a lot of parallel situations in the series to show the connection between all the issues and the show demonstrates that rich families are just as troubled as the poor. "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent film,"This film was my first contact with Renoir, the director. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,love it!,"I'm giving this 5 stars, although it should be said this is the first workout video I've tried so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  But I bought it because I had tried pilates briefly awhile ago and enjoyed it, and I wanted to strenghten my whole body.  I have 3 kids and only a spare 20 minutes or so out of a whole day; I've been using this dvd at night when they'e asleep.  I really really like it.  The moves aren't easy, but they are doable and I can feel it working.  The next day, even after the first time I did it, I feel like I'm standing straighter.  "

dvd,8 of 11,5.0,THIS MOVIE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR FREEDOM,"Politics, religion, economics, sociology, philosophy and history; this movie is an intellectual paradise for the true free thinker.   Herb Meyer lectures on the idea of Western Civilization and how it is threatened today.  He gives remedies for these threats, and not all of them deal with dropping bombs.  This is not a flashy movie; its quality is in its information.  This film is not recommended for the close-minded. "

dvd,8 of 9,4.0,Why did it stop???????!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this dvd sight unseen after reading so many great reviews and I am not sorry that I did. It is a wonderful mini-series! I enjoyed the story and the characters. All very catchy. What I don't understand is why it stopped! I want to know more! Is Matty pregnant???? What of Lydia and Hannah? And Jack, does he get a girl? I enjoyed it so much that I sat there for the whole 8 1/2 hours (excluding the 5 minute breaks here and there) to watch the entire series! I couldn't stop. I wanted to know more and now I am stuck still wanting to know more. "

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A movie to watch again and again,"Meg Ryan is one of my favorite actresses to watch in movies.  The opening scene of her in the airplane is worth watching the movie, it's so hilarious!  Kevin Kline play the great Frenchman and the scenery was really great."

dvd,3 of 5,5.0,"This is a must buy Box Set, that will sadly be dismissed by the casual movie/TV viewer as a children's cartoon.","This has to be one of the best anime ever.  It blends cop drama, believable future gadgets and nice political twists that is better presented than most other TV shows and movies.  I think it is sad to know that most people will categorize this series as a children's cartoon and pass it up.  For the lovers of the movies, this has a lot more to offer and the final episodes round up things very good.  You'll have to see it for yourself, but you wont be disappointed to pick up this series. The only negative part that I can think of is that after this, you wont be satisfied with any other Sci-Fi movie or TV series accept for Battle star Galactica and the DC cartoons (Batman TAS, Superman, Justice league etc.). I won't be going into many details for the episodes, seeing that this is a very loved series and has been reviewed before on this site. This is your chance to buy the whole series in one box set and for a very low price. I have been waiting a long time for this box set and I am very glad to be able to buy it when it arrives. I implore you to do the same"

dvd,27 of 30,4.0,Absolutely a great movie,"Great movies, like great literature, are capable of evoking a definite atmosphere, that of the time and setting of the story, the plot of which, then, almost loses significance. The atmosphere in this case is that of New Orleans at the turn of last century - a slight anachronism here sets the story in 1917 to match the timing of the closure of Storyville, New Orleans's red light district, located roughly between Rampart and Robeson, Iberville and St. Louis, of which nothing remains today. That atmosphere is well expressed by the music, especially that of the pianist in the movie, who is modeled after Jelly Roll Morton, a pioneer jazz pianist and composer, and plays his compositions. For the curious listener, I have listed here some of the works by Jelly Roll and when they get played in the movie:"

dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Good for overweight people,"I am currently 90+ lb overweight (hey, I know that's bad, but it's down from 150 lbs over). I also have an autoimmune disease and fibromyalgia. I've tried other exercise programs and like many people with rheumatic conditions, suffered from ""delayed payback"" whenever I exercised. Then I started thinking that yoga might be a good idea because it is tends to concentrate more on breathing and relaxation instead of the frenzied exercise in other program. However, I was not sure I could do any yoga, since I am so overweight. "
dvd,4 of 9,5.0,Christian images abound,"I am often looking for movies with good Christian themes without them being overtly Christian, pious, or preachy.  The Iron Giant works at many levels: as an amazing piece of animation, as an entertaining childrens' story, as a family movie, but also as deeply moving addition to an already rich trove of Catholic Eucharistic theology.  The image of a great man from above coming to the earth, learning to love the creatures he meets, being touched by the death he sees around him, with a great power to save others from their own sins inside him but he sets it aside--chooses to set it aside--because of what he has learned about self-sacrificing love.  And let's not forget the whole ""Body of Christ"" and Communion analogy that is so powerfully portrayed in the final scene (right down to the star in the sky that is a sign that salvation has come).  The coming together of the entire body."
dvd,19 of 19,5.0,Dinner and a Show,"I knew I would love learning from Julia's shows and see lots of techniques but I had no idea how hilarious these shows are.  Julia has a dry humor and a delightful way of handling mishaps but the burned french onion soup and the tart that flipped out of the pan and onto the counter were the best!!  No one on the food network would let you see how to do this part of cooking.  I'm too young to have seen the shows first hand so there are all new to me.  Julia said in an interview once that she always considered herself a cooking teacher and she is.  The dish being prepared is just the vehicle to teach about everything from how to shop for food to how important it is to keep your area clean and tidy.  And did you know that apples must be stirred with a ""purple spoon?""  Everything that I make from these DVDs is great and has become a kitchen regular.  I recommend them for entertainment, education and a good laugh"
dvd,4 of 21,2.0,Mixed Feelings...,"     I can definately see how this show could seem interesting to pre-teens because they haven't been through puberty and been opened up to newer,more exciting emotions that this show doesn't portray. The kids try their best most of the time but you can tell that these kids should be in a different feild; maybe commercials would better suit them. But the actors are not the only problem with this borderline show...the writers have to take a chunk of critisim as well. The writing is trying to make the show intense but then they throw in cliques or childish scenes that sometimes make you wonder if the crew had put together a drama and an after-school special in one show. Sometimes these elements are a match made in television heaven..or they cancel each other out, so that you can't enjoy the good-parts of the show because of the overshadowing cloud of below-average acting and storylines that can be annoying and cumbersome.

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Baby Einstein is great from my 2 year old,"As a new buyer of Baby Einstein, I was very impressed with it. The words and signs presented were easy enough for my 2 year old son to grasp, and for the two weeks we have had this title, he has started signing me some of the words (especially the easier ones, like store.) The only warning I have for this DVD is that your child will want to watch Baby Einstein over and over again; this, however, is very good becuase I would rather have my son learning sign language that watching other movies that have to eduational value"

I am a big besson fan and came across this older movie a few years ago (before the dvd release) when I found it at a tag sale in a box of Laser Discs. Being a diver and realizing what the movie was about (life underwater as if you ARE a creature of the sea, with the music to match the sea creatures ""personalities"", among other things) I actually shopped ebay to buy a Laser Disc just to watch this movie. It was worth it.  I think this is much better than the Koyaanisqatsi series because of its simplicity and compactness.  The essential Luc Besson if you will"

dvd,,5.0,Great Video when you want to take it easy.,"I love the quickfix workouts.  They are only 10 minutes each, so if you are in a hurry or just want to squeeze something in these videos are perfect.  There are nine videos (3 abs, 3 buns, one arms, one legs, and one legs and arms).  You can do them individually or select up to three to run back to back, which gives a good, fast 30-minute workout.  The great thing about these workouts is that after you do them for a while you will remember them without the video!  It's nice when you want to watch TV, but feel guilty because you need to workout.  The hosts are not annoying, which is also nice."

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,"Best Concert DVD, EVER!","Okay what do you get when you Slayer+Reign In Blood+Live+A Documentary+ Bonus Live Tracks? You get the best concert DVD EVER! Slayer prove that they are still on top. They play the whole Reign in Blood album plus a few other classics such as ""Madatory Suicide"" and ""South of Heavan"". Slayer also has Dave Lombardo, back in the crew, which makes it even better! The sound quality is crystal clear and loud and the video quality is great. The documentary is awesome too, they interview the band members and give you a look into how Slayer started, how they made the DVD, and all of that good stuff. Slayer still tear ass all over any other metal band, do not hesitate to buy this"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Incredible DVD, but the music makes it","I first saw Haunted Castle as a feature at the IMAX in New Orleans, LA.  The imagery alone was enough to astound, but the music that follows the story added a dimension that no pop-up graphics could.  The band which supplies the music, Arid, also performs a live set at the end. The lead singer Jasper stars as the film's lead character in a sticky situation.  You will love this DVD, even if only for the music. And guaranteed you'll be left wondering who that enchanted voice (and face) belongs to long after the credits roll"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,A &quot;Beau  Geste&quot; for the Modern Era,"I grew up watching &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (which is a film which deserves to be on DVD)and all other films about the French Foreign Legion fall or rise to that film's greatness.  That being so, &quot;Legionnaire&quot; stands as a solid drama of the men who join the legion to forget their past lives and to rebuild new ones--if they survive.  The film is well-crafted and the wide-screen format is perfect in bringing the viewer the feel of the desert--its vastness, its heat, and its beauty.  The film's action scenes are sensational and the final battles are both memorable and brutal.  Jean-Claude Van Damme proves he is more than just a good body or fighting machine--he does some fine acting in this film.  One wishes that it could be seen on the large screen--it deserves it"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Greatest Female Comedian of All Time,"As if this series needs any introduction or praises from anyone. It's simply the most watched, most hilarious sitcom to ever grace the television! Whether you watch the first season or the final season, you will not be disappointed. Feeling sad? Wanting a good laugh? Just pop in I Love Lucy and you're on your way to laughter...leaving your troubles behind...even if only for a brief moment in time"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Amazing DVD,"I'm a big fan of Nickelback and have yet to see them in concert (hope so with the release of the next album).  I bought the DVD and could not wait to view it, and was not disappointed.  Chad Kroeger has an amazing voice and it was gratifying to see that it's the same on recording as it is live.  I hope they release a DVD with material from Silver Side Up and well as The Long Road!  My guy is a musician and while he was just a fringe Nickelback fan, now that he's ""seen"" them live he's a huge fan! "
dvd,2 of 11,4.0,Hilarious movie!,"Truly a classic, though beware of nudity (there's a naked Graham Chapman for a brief moment!"
dvd,3 of 7,4.0,Erotic movie! Great acting. Good score.,"Don Johnson is so good-looking in this movie - but I think he smokes in almost every scene, which takes away from his attractiveness.  Virginia Madsen was absolutely wonderful and played the part to perfection and was very erotic!  Good movie, but a lot of sex!  I loved the score - it was great"
dvd,0 of 4,1.0,GARBAGE,This movie was really a waste of money. the writing the directin are all very bad. it is also very low budget which i thought would increase the realness but i was wrong safe your money and keep searchin
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Wonderful,These movies are great! The thing i like the most about them is that you can watch them over and over and not get tired. If you don't have this package you should get it but i will warn  you they will be more enjoyable for women
dvd,1 of 3,4.0,a diamond in the rough,"not your typical romantic comedy, this one is a bit less traditional, a bit more stylized, but zany and wacky as befits Tom Hanks with some fun Meg Ryan thrown in the mix.  I absolutely love it, but must add a disclaimer that 1) if you consider yourself very picky about movies, or 2) only like standard Hollywood fare, you might not enjoy this."
dvd,,4.0,A Great Inside View Of Hollywood,"This movie, along with her other collaberation with director Mike Nichols, ""Silkwood"", are Meryl Streep's two best movies in my opinion. Fully relatable characters, well acted, witty script, and a behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood, and its relationships that is very realistic. This film is very underrated, in my opinion.  This film would make a great addition to anyone's collection, for those who like films of a certain standard"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Clapool and his people,"When I saw this DVD for sale I bought it without thinking twice. It has all of Les Claypool's side projects including: Sausage, Frog Brigade, C2B3, Oysterhead, and more! All preformances are live and the locations on some include: Bonaroo, and Jam Cruise. "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,A very good movie ....,"This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great.  The action scenes are particularly terrifying; particularly when the T-Rex breaks through the fence; also, when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen -- too bad I was rooting for the raptors.  But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse-pounding!  "
dvd,,5.0,In other words...,"Everone else already said this is the &quot;best dvd EVER&quot; so there is no point repeating that... I will simply add to it my favorite qualities...  The absolute best thing is the live acoustic performace they did in Cali.... they redid A Certian Shade of Green to sound totally chill... the singing notes are even completely different.  When you enter the vegas option each time you click on it it shows something different (one of those things you just have to own it to understand).  It has all their already made videos on there which is great since I liked them w/o ever seeing a video until this dvd.  Take me to your leader is a funny video.  It's just plain cool... even if you don't like Incubus music (how could you not), just get the dvd for good laughs.  Only drawback.. it doesn't play everything straight through, sometimes you have to click on each individual thing"
dvd,21 of 23,5.0,Remembering,"Twenty years later, after PLATOON was released in 1986 and brought some of the horrors of the Vietnam experience to the public's media-jaundiced eye, at last the film can be seen and discussed critically.  'At last', in this viewer's vocabulary, includes the fact that more time for healing from actually being in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969 has passed, making the response to Oliver Stone's film more rational.  Now the film is a film, not a nightmare memory inducer, and that fact in no way diminishes the power of the message."
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Ninja Scroll Review,"I'd like to say Ninja Scroll is a masterpiece, for all you samurai/ninja action fans this movie is up there. Its close in comparison to Samurai X the OVA's in my opinion. Have seen VERY few action anime that can top this, any otaku should get this, "
dvd,,4.0,Immaculate collection,"Overall, this dvd is very good."
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Dark Star Review,"This film still made me laugh quite a bit, but it is something best watched while slightly intoxicated I think, at least it was for my friends.  There is a fantastic elevator scene and the fact that it was made so long ago makes it a bit of a novelty for science fiction fans.  I'd compare it only slightly to Killer Klowns from Outer Space or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"
dvd,,5.0,CARREY'S BEST! FUNNY AND INSIGHTFUL!,"""Bruce Almighty"" is, without a doubt, Jim Carrey's best film to date! As Bruce Nolan, Carrey delivers yet another brilliantly-wacky performance, while also bringing some more to the role as a man who learns what it really means to be God. Morgan Freeman is actually very believable as God, giving Him both a mystique, as well as a sense of humor. And, even though I'm not the  biggest fan of Jennifer Aniston, she does a good job as Grace. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Big Daddy is Big Hit.,"Big Daddy is about a guy named Sonny (Adam Sandler) who adopts a 5 year old kid (Julian) under the name of his room-mate, Kevin Garrety (Jon Stewart) to impress his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson). He finds out his girlfriend is dating an older guy and Sonny is dumped and left with the kid. Sonny decides he can take care of him until Social Services can find an foster home for him, but Sonny falls in love with the kid and avoids Social Services. Then Social Services finds out Sonny was using Kevin's name and they take the kid away. Sonny tries to fight for him, but unable to get him and custody goes to the real Kevin who is in China for most of the movie. Juilan wants Sonny to be his dad, but Sonny says he can't, but he can always be his friend. So the movie ends at a happy note."
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Scary Hot HORROR--Excellent 10+,"Excellent horror film!! One of the best horror films since the original ""Halloween."" Great story, plot line and characters. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Leave the lights on"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,extra counting bonus!,"My son got this DVD for Christmas.  He just turned two and he loves it.  The best part is that thanks to the song and the numbers that flash introducing each type of truck, he can count to twenty and identify the numbers when he sees them as well.  I agree with some of the other reviews, the narration is bland, it sounds sort of like Ferris Beuler's teacher, (Anyone? Anyone?) and the production quality is that of any locally produced training film, but the kids love it!  My three year old daughter can now also identify flat bed tow trucks and most importantly,  Mommy can have a good un-interrupted 40 minutes or so to get things done like dinner or a shower!  Worth the money, hands down"
dvd,6 of 8,4.0,Changing,"I invited a (girl) friend of mine to watch this movie with me.  After fifteen minutes I could saw that she was extremely bored, so I stopped the ""tape"" (because in this DivX days tape is at all used any more) and asked her what happened.  ""It's a boring movie"", she said, ""and the boy is really not cute"".  She was conditioned to think that in an American movie with a male and female character the two of them must be attractive.  She looked at the surface, at the shape of things.  Would she die of horror if she had seen the end?  I doubt so.  The human kind has a considerable capacity for cover what nobody should seen or thought of."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great comprehensive yoga workout,"I have been practicing yoga on and off for several years both in classes and at home on my own.  I was getting bored with my beginner level DVDs (also from Rodney Yee and very good for people just starting out) and was looking for something more intense.  ""Power Yoga: Total Body"" is a great workout -- it's physically demanding enough to keep me coming back time and again, but not so hard that I got discouraged early on.  I always feel great after doing this DVD, and I've seen a dramatic increase in my flexibility over the last several months.  It's a very satisfying and effective workout that can be adapted for beginners but will also keep intermediate-level practioners interested. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Fantastic,"I remember The Point from when I was a child. When I had children of my own I wanted to indroduce this lovely story of Oblio & his dog, Arrow to my girls. The music is catchy for toddlers & has a wonderful message of acceptance. Of course my husband & I love it as well & can watch it as many times as our girls do"
dvd,19 of 20,5.0,Fun to do and a great workout too!,"I have had very little experience with The Firm, but lately, I've been enjoying videos that feature aerobic weight training (such as the FitPrime and WHFN series), so I decided to give this a try.  Complete Aerobics and Weight Training is a 58-minute workout which combines cardio segments with cardio/sculpt intervals to give you a great workout; it's led by Emily Welsh.  Equipment used in this workout includes The Firm ""Fanny Lifter,"" a 2-part step (both the full step and the low position are used here), 3 sets of dumbbells, and The Firm ""Sculpting Stick"" (dumbbells can be substituted and/or you can use a wall/mop for balance)."
dvd,1 of 24,1.0,tic toc...  tic toc...,"If you're only used to more modern westerns, this one will kill you.  It's is almost shot in real time (meaning that they show the clock constantly, and it's as slow as the movie).  Sadly predictable by today's standards."
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Worthy of the Name... Jurassic,"A surprisingly good film considering it is the third in the series, Jurassic Park III, provides another take on the well known by now paleontologist and of course... the dinosaurs!  When Alan Grant is contacted by a wealthy couple to act as a guide on an aerial tour over the restricted island of Sorna things are not all that they seem..."
dvd,40 of 41,4.0,Suddenly not as relevant as it used to be...thank God,"Watching this DVD after October 27, 2004 is like watching ""Three Kings"" after the 2003 Iraq war.  It documents or portrays a relevant moment in time, immortalizing it forever, yet subsequent events drastically affect the poignancy of the original artistic achievement."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Classic - be aware, SE coming later in '06","There is finally a Special Edition of this movie due later this year. I own this original release, but don't mind the upcoming double-dip because this movie is CLASSIC. One of the funniest comedies, animated or otherwise, ever. Mike Judge is a comedic genius."

dvd,0 of 1,4.0,Terror Train Jamie Lee Curtis,"Jamie Lee Curtis plays a college co-ed who and her friends throw a party on a train, and a killer is amoung them.... "
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Simply an enjoyable show,"This isn't the type of movie that will make you reflect and question your life's ambitions, it's designed to make you laugh. I think it succeeds admirably. Molly Ringwald is perfect as the budding teenager ready to have life meet her full-force. She is surrounded by a quirky, forgetful family (complete with a jerk for a younger brother), nerdy boys desperate for her attention, good friends with whom she can be herself, and (naturally) a love interest. Anthony Michael Hall's character is as funny a dorky kid as I've ever seen...his dance moves are legendary! He has several monologues that still bring out genuine laughs from me, even after all these years of watching this classic. "
dvd,3 of 5,5.0,i think i might just die for her.......,"this was the best out of the ROTLD series, it isnt funny (thats a good thing for a zombie movie) the effects are pretty good, but the first part was pretty sad, the dude lost his girlfriend on a motorcycle, poor guy, but the stupid thing that he did was try to bring her back to life with the Troxin. it also showed these scientists try to bring back a cadaver, the thing turned out biting one of the scientists fingers off. this was really good, great dvd too!!"
dvd,10 of 11,5.0,Best ever Shakespeare!,"I was lucky enough to see this production of the Scottish play in the theatre, and it retains its place as one of the most thrilling evenings at the theatre in my life! Both Ian McKellen and Judi Dench gave extraordinary performances of great power and beauty. Though no dvd or film or video can match the live experience this dvd comes very close to doing so. Filmed in close up a lot of the time the viewer is right there in the middle of the action, the plotting, the murders, and the excitement. The poetry of Shakespeare's language cannot be bettered, nor better delivered, with all the actors speaking their lines as if they had just thought of them. If you like great theatre and acting this is one your collection cannot be without"
dvd,,5.0,In the beginning...,"If you are a ""friend of Bill W"", you will appreciate this dramatization of Bill's life, the acting is superb and you will find a lot to identify with. Seeing how Bill isn't around to tell it himself (other than the stilted version in the Big Book), you will see the progression of the illness and understand where the program came from"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,JULIE ANDREWS IS THE BEST!,IN THIS MOVIE JULIE ANDREWS ROCK. SHE IS THE STAR OF THIS MOVIE! ALL THE SONGS EVERYONE SINGS ARE JUST GREAT. I THINK THIS MOVIE IS SO APPELING BECAUSE ITS ABOUT A WOMAN(JULIE ANDREWS) WHO WANTS TO STAY MODERN. AND ON THE WAY SOME OF HER FRIENDS SUPRISE HER WILL A SHOCKING NEWS THAT MAKES THE MOVIE JUST MORE INTERESTING! I HOPE YOU TAKE MY ADDVISE AND BUY THIS MOVIE!
dvd,1 of 8,1.0,huh?,Some guy kills himself on the subway while I video tape it.  Now I want to see fear. What he saw before he killed himself. I will go on some psyhedelic mind trip to an underworld and bring back a naked girl to my apartment.  I will cut myself and let her drink my blood.  Then she disappears so I go back to the underworld and there she is naked and chained to a rock with a video camera filming me.  UGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH  I'm going crazy.  The End.
dvd,,5.0,The Long Good Bye,"This is a movie that is often overlooked when it comes to the career of James Cagney.  This was his last major role before his death.  When watching this movie, you can gain a real sense of what a tremendous actor Cagney was in his hey day.  This file is also notable for the debut of Elizabeth McGovern.  The supporting cast is tremendous--Donald O'Connor,Harold Rollins, & Mary Steenburgen just to name a few of the great actors & actresses that make this a must own movie"
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,"Mire or spire?  From base to pinnacle, who are we anyway?","Danny Parker is a meth addict and a snitch for the police as well.  He used to be Tom Van Allen, before the death of his wife in an unrelated drug raid near the Salton Sea.  From Tom the trumpet player to Danny the addict, Danny's downward spiral has had a purpose."
dvd,1 of 6,1.0,a poorly edited documentary; story misses the mark,"I agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there aren't more dissenting opinions. This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.) The filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it. Don't bother with this one."
dvd,0 of 7,1.0,"Great cast, Terrible Movie","What the hell are fabulous actors Christian Slater, Julianne Moore, Steve Bucemi, Debbie Harry and Matthew Lawrence doing in this piece of trash? Even Are You Afraid of the Dark? is creepier and more captivating than this stinker. This is a collection of lacluster stories that are a waste of time"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,exceptional,awesome script actors and special effects. one of my top ten movies.thank-you for having it availabl
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,Fun movie for airliners fans,"This DVD is split into two seperate films, one on the 747 and another on the 777. Each film starts with a history of Boeing, and jet aviation. Next, they cover the engineering and manufacturing problems involved in pushing jet travel to the next level, with the 747 version focusing on problems with size and the 777 version talking about the engineering and computerized development tasks. The 777 version actually covers alot of the 747 development and does a lot of comparison between the two. Neither version is very technical, but they are well narated and there are some interesting facts about both planes sprinkled throughout. Nevertheless, the DVD has good footage on both planes and will be enjoyed by any plane fanatic"
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Great Episodes,"As usual, Archie has his crazy ideas of how the world works, the races work, women work, and everything else that he's made up or gathered from his brain or bigoted friends.  I love every minute of it!  I think I enjoy this show because if you look past the obvious, you will learn a lesson.  Episodes like ""Judging Books By Covers"" explains that it's not always the most obvious that are homosexual...and just like anybody else, they are people too, so get over it.  In ""Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood,"" it is more than obvious that Lionel has been coming into Archie's home for years, but suddenly when a black family moves into the neighborhood, Archie realizes that he may have to bend more of his ""rules"".  I am crazy about Lionel's tactics in dealing with Archie...and how Archie can't seem to realize that Lionel is making fun of him ALL THE TIME. ""The First and Last Supper"" was entertaining because this is when George Jefferson gets to show that he is just as bad as Archie by not showing up to dinner.  "
dvd,0 of 5,2.0,"Wow, in a Bad Way","This production of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is cringeworthy at best.  I understand this was a television movie, but they couldn't at least choose good actors and provide a better set?  Cinderella acts and sounds like a complete ditz, all starry-eyed and breathless voice.  It's partly the fault of the camera-work though.  Every 10 seconds and it's an extreme close-up of Cinderella's face.  It's frightening.  I love the music and this musical, but if it's not well-acted or well-sung, it's not enjoyable for me.  I've only heard the Julie Andrews version in soundtrack form, and already that one is 100X better.  There's none of the pleasant, exciting, and lovely performances of the original cast.  This version has no energy.  The exception is the Prince and his parents the King and Queen; they weren't bad.  But the rest of the show is the epitome of cheesiness - which could have been avoided if feeling and energy were put into the performances, even despite the terrible sets.  "
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,Cinematic Tour de Force,"Even if French New Wave Cinema of the 1950's and 1960's is of no interest to you, don't be put off seeing this incredible film. If you do have an interest in films from this period and you haven't yet seen &quot;Cleo&quot; then make a promise to yourself to see this film now. Director Agnes Varda made a movie back in 1960-61  that rises above language, time, place and fashion to be a masterpiece in world cinema. In some respects this is a neglected masterpiece as it is seldom spoken in the same breath as films like &quot;400 Blows&quot;, but that makes the pleasure of discovering it all the more sweet. Amongst the highlights - a gorgeous and clever score by Michel Legrand who makes a wonderful appearance as &quot;Bob, the Pianist&quot;; astonishing camerawork throughout - innumerable sequences that make you wonder &quot;how did they do that?&quot;. Varda is such an assured filmmaker that she can turn what at first appear to be momentary lapses of energy and inspiration into ever more revealing and moving climaxes. One of the great movies. You won't regret spending a summer evening in Paris with Cleo"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Pop culture classic,"One of the greatest teen movies of all times. If you were in high school during the 80s, you've seen it. The movie is real, funny and a timeless classic.   I must admit there is a bit of a lull about 3/4 through, after the abortion, but other than that the movie is perfect.  If you haven't seen it lately, check it out and you'll start to remember high school again like it was yesterday. Need more - check out the book."
dvd,,5.0,A Fun Movie!,"""Wedding Crashers"" starts off slow, I thought it was going to be a disaster of a movie, but I was wrong. By the end, the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch. Yeah, this movie is overhyped a little, but it is still a really good movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are raally great in their roles on this film. It's not a film you have to really think about, it is just a good comedy."
dvd,16 of 25,5.0,Memento (Limited Edition) DVD,This is a great DVD for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not.  The package is worth the coin.
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"""Dr. Katz"" Revisited","Upon hearing a synopsis of this movie, I was immediately reminded of a favorite episode of ""Dr. Katz"" (bring back Dr. Katz!), and on that basis decided to view ""Pieces of April"". Here Katie Holmes gets to play the Ben Katz role of trying to prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for her nutso family, only instead of burning it (""Fire in the hole!""), she discovers that her oven doesn't work at all. Hence she must go door-to-door in her 'rustic' NYC apartment building; meanwhile her parents and siblings are piling into the family station wagon in suburban NJ for their much anticipated-with-trepidation journey."

dvd,2 of 4,4.0,Can we presume to be better than God?,"Apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime, the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment. It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign  Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication  of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson. There was a new hope in that man. But that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor."
dvd,2 of 27,1.0,Profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film.,"Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of ""heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,"" is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see."
dvd,8 of 11,2.0,Not what I expected!,"I was really looking forward to this DVD.  It looked like a great concept, Oscar the Grouch as Scrooge.  However, it really wasn't that great.  It basically uses the older Sesame Street Christmas episodes (Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, Elmo Saves Christmas, and Elmo's World Holiday) as the past and present.  I expected more of a storyline with all new footage.  Also, the ghosts are not puppets, they are animated (and not that well, might I add).  They seem really fuzzy and don't fit in.  "
dvd,1 of 2,2.0,They Tried,This movie well it was boosted up like it was something really great. It had its moments but man. It had its weak times too. The little monster in this movie was just screaming like a girl the whole movie and that was really annoying. You can check it out. I didn't like it too much though. Oh well thats my opinion. Maybe you can find some good in it.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Many people have been ""Hoodwinked"" by this movie; and there's a good reason why.","All of you should know ""Little Red Riding Hood"", but in this movie, it shows what really happened on that crazy fairy tale. Ever since the Goody Bandit started to steal recipies from goody shops, all except one store shut down. In the movie, you have the four characters (Red, Wolf, Granny, and Woodsman) telling the police about what really happened."
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,Die Mensch-Maschine,"Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is a revolutionary work in the cinematic medium and is considered by many to be the first film of the science fiction genre.  When released in 1927, it stood in stark contrast with American standards of filmmaking, which were mostly shot in open outdoor areas.  Rather than imitate nature, ""Metropolis"" consciously rejected it, with some of the most elaborate and complicated structures ever designed for a motion picture.  In doing so, Lang embraced the modernism of his era, in which mass industry continued to widen the gap between classes.  The films construction of the `man-machine' was an appropriate reflection on the times as well.  As technology was becoming something which people were growing increasingly dependant upon, the worker was transforming into an extension of the machines in which he or she used.  This mechanization and overall feeling of loss in ones own humanity is exemplified by the film's opening shots where the workers switch shifts and operate machinery in a robotic and calculated manner."

dvd,,5.0,Greatest DVD Boxset Available.  Period.,"The title of the review says it all.  If you are an Alien fan that is.  I won't go into the specs as those are available elsewhere.  Two of the features that make this set so noteworthy are the extended cut of Alien 3, and the extensive documentaries on all 4 movies.  Although I really enjoyed Alien 3, I still thought it was the weakest of all 4 movies.  Visually, the movie is beautiful, but story wise, it was a very hard movie to get into after two major characters from Aliens get killed off in the opening credits (not spoiling anything), and one is mangled almost beyond repair.  However, having said all that, the new version, even though not approved by David Fincher, is a much better version that the theatrical.  Definitely worth the watch.  "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic workout,"This is my favorite DVD for home yoga practice.  It is a fantastic buy for the price:  you get 3 full workouts that are challenging, stimulating and enlivening.  The first two are so challenging, in fact, that I haven't even attempted the 3rd workout!  Bryan Kest promises that after the practice you will ""feel alive"" and be ""tingling from your head to your feet.""  SO TRUE!  I do have to warn, however, that even ""Energize"" is quite difficult and probably not feasible for yoga beginners.  I am in really good shape and I have to drop out of some of the poses! He is a very good teacher and coaxes you through the harder poses with great insight.  "
dvd,3 of 5,4.0,It keeps getting better....,"Although though graphics have changed the movie becomes richer (and darker) with subplots and character development. My 5 year old is addicted to all things hot wheels and we're very excited about all the acceleracers sequels. So far he and we as a family love the first two. I'm only disappointed by one character: Marky Wylde has changed a little too much both physically and personality. They are street racers, kind of and I don't agree with street racing but thats why we theach our kids right from wrong and hope they listen! Other than that the movie is good fun and well worth buying for any hot wheels fan!  "
dvd,3 of 6,1.0,A Huge Disappointment,"Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself."
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Really good movie,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I like the story and the movie"
dvd,,5.0,Steele steals your heart,"I loved the entire series when it first came on the air and it was great to see it all over again revisting Remington Steele Investigations. When I first saw Pierce Brosnan on this show I knew he would become James Bond one day. But it is Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt who creates the agency by creating a ficticious boss that is the foundation of the show. Her spunk and creativity drives the episodes and is an inspiration for other women. The romance between her and Mr. Steele smolders for several seasons. Who can say enough about Doris Roberts, a terrific seasoned actress as their administrative/secy side kick....just wonderful. The final episode is the one you waited for, for over 5 years! You wished there was more but you can imagine that they lived happily ever after. Enjoy Seasons 4 and 5 but don't forget how it all began in seasons 1 thru 3. You can trace the gradual maturity in their realtionship and approach to business throught all 5 seasons."
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Opens your mind to Chicana Life,"This movie reminds me of back in the dayz, growing up in Kali, I enjoyed because it puts out there the issues chicana girls have growing up, for other people that don't quite get Chicana Life this movie will help you understand, even though now in dayz it's not that harsh, growing up in city like L.A ,  the barrio is your familia if you want to survive the gang streets.... a must see movie overall!!! Chicana Love, La Travies"
dvd,,5.0,Queer Again.,"Great series, just glad they finally made it the new Thinpack, and much lower price"
dvd,13 of 18,4.0,Phenomenal Dancing Elevates Standard Backstage Plot,"All the elements of a great musical seem to be evident in this 1953 movie, but for some reason, it just doesn't gel as well as other MGM musical classics of the era such as the Hollywood talkie-craze satire, ""Singin' in the Rain"", or even the lightweight expatriate romance, ""An American in Paris"". Directed by the masterful Vincente Minnelli, the movie centers on a fading star named Tony Hunter, a once protean movie star dancer trying to make a comeback on Broadway in a misbegotten musical production of ""Faust"". That he is portrayed by the legendary Fred Astaire goes a long way to make this a wonderful viewing experience. His singing, especially his rendition of the melancholy ""By Myself"", is charming and relaxed, and his dancing is beyond dazzling."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent English Humor,"I remember seeing this movie back in the 70's when it came out and the part with the Holy Hand grinade is hilarious, my son watches it and so does his friends.  It is a well made spoof on the Crusades that has stood the test of time.  It is for older children because of language and some sexual pictures.  It is a good funny film to watch on a friday night"
dvd,,5.0,Collectors Packaging rates a ZERO,Although this will always be a 5 star movie in any edition it appears the  $21.00 higher price on this edition may not be worth spending.
dvd,10 of 12,5.0,easy going entertainment,"Who cares if this movie is going nowhere like some complain.  Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra give a lot of laughs and Ursalla Andress and Anita Ekberg are perfect partners for them.  The rest of the cast make the movie  something different that usual western spoofs.  You get two semi-good guys,  two bad baddies, and an assortment of others plus a cameo by the Three  Stooges.  What more can you want.  The good guys win in the end, the gals  get the guys, and everyone lives happily ever after.  It's great.  No  social message or deep plot, just pure enjoyment for some of us lighter  hearted movie buffs"
dvd,8 of 35,1.0,As awful as it possibly might be,"And this is from someone who thinks that U2 music and lyrics are in the top echelon of rock music accomplishments, next to those of Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Nirvana. Let me be frank here: these videos, with the exception of Wim's spot and the footage from the 1992 gig, are an evidence of total lack of creativity and spirit. Period"
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,More than you could expect!,"An experienced dancer and gymnast, I believe this video provides enough to learn moves and style to go from beginner to a good competent break dancer. I was shocked at the quality of instruction. I believe that I would have to travel far in order to find such explicit and useful directions. I will encourage the Break Dance teachers at the local YMCA to use this as an educational tool. My six year old is an up and coming Breaker and there is enough stuff on these DVDs to keep him busy for at least a few years. Thank you to the instructors and producers of this amazing video"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""","I was one of the few that actually saw ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". Not because of any affinity for Hunter S. Thompson(who I had never heard of before; forgive me I was fourteen), but after seeing this movie, which is best described as a ""flawed masterpiece"", I immediatley became a fan of the man, as I am still a fan of this movie."
dvd,0 of 4,4.0,Choose to live over vengeance.,"A favorite Steve McQueen vehicle, the sprawling western that stretches a bit too far. To me, this was just a hip take on the western melodramas of the 50's. In the early scenes, McQueen could have helped cedibility a great bit by letting another actor play himself as an adolescent. I believe this was an early Harold Robbins novel and toned down into the lengthy story. As McQueen's character moves across the land in hunt of those responsible for killing his family, there are wonderful life-changing moments. Brian Keith's gun lore and rapport with McQueen is worth the whole viewing. Another mini-scene within this adventure is with the under-utilized, Suzanne Pleshette, in the swamplands of Louisiana. Love nearly conquered, slowing the story until McQueen catches up with Karl Malden and his thugs. Malden is strong in his scenes, but there is too much horseplay at the end that makes the revenge a bit silly and wrong-headed, since any red-blooded man would have run off with Pleshette anyway. Right when you want McQueen to kill the thugs, there's some nonsense with a Mission priest that slows the finish even more. Cut-up and shown on TV, it was a tighter, more fluid story. Like Malden's ""Left-handed Gun,"" the film is uneven and crawls in spots. We forgive this movie when the sum of the mini-scenes do not add up to a successful whole, for the fact that an editor did not do what was best. I don't even remember what revenge McQueen's character had at the end. 30 years later I watch the movie to see Pleshette, Keith and McQueen do what casts of 10 or so on TV sitcoms can never approach.Kudos for casting, thumbs down for pacing."
dvd,5 of 15,4.0,an interesting movie,this is a good movie i would say. the main character hooks up with a husseler who uses a lot of drugs. funny little girl who sells weed at her school. good movie kind of sad.
dvd,,4.0,An Enlightling Movie,I concur with the AFI.  One of the 100 most inspiring movies of all times (specially if you are a lawyer or a law student)
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Bottle Rocket,"This is one of my favorite movies. I love all Wes Anderson's work: Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic. Mr. Anderson focuses on the little things in life, the small things that matter. He makes the characters very real (though usually very eccentric) by bringing out common family/relationship issues. I highly recommend these movies, but you will either love them or really NOT love them"
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,The Way things should be,"""Anne of Green Gables"" shows how a combination of love, honesty, hard work, tolerance and integrity is the perfect mix for bringing out the best from the potential in anyone, even in a non-traditional family. It's an incredibly refreshing break from today's society, where lying and manipulation have become almost a norm in much of the world we know"
dvd,1 of 14,1.0,Waste of Time & Money,"Save your money and time, even you like some of the actors, the movie is a pure flunk!!"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent New Trad Irish Music,"Danu brings extraordinary musicianship, a nice stage presence and self-deprecating humor to Irish tradiitonal music.  The concert itself features variety of instrumentation and vocals, and the extras -- interviews with the band members -- are revealing of the at once ordinary and extraordinary folks who are the band.  The sound and video quality is excellent and avoids the overproduced aspects of a lot of music DVDs. if you want to hear what younger Irish traditional musicians sound like these days, this is a best bet.   "
dvd,13 of 15,5.0,"Brendon, Jason, and Melissa take their final bows.","I'm sure that all Adult Swim fans in 2003 knew that the current fourth season of Home Movies would be its last.  All the signs were there: an eight month hiatus between seasons, no advertising, all episodes shot off in succession as quickly and quietly as possible.  This was no stretch for my imagination; I was also a Futurama fan so it was nothing I hadn't seen before.  But I still couldn't easily accept why the show didn't draw more viewers than it did.  Cartoon Network was the perfect channel for the show and yet that wasn't enough.  Perhaps it wasn't ""avant-garde"" like its concurrent original shows Aqua Teens or Sealab 2021 (and by that I mean it had linear plots that weren't subsumed by unmitigated chaos).  In any case, there's nothing we can do about it now except to settle in, pop the final season's DVD's in your players, and watch Home Movies' swan songs."
dvd,7 of 12,5.0,this movie delivers,"As someone well versed in various kinds of literature, someone who has read (and enjoyed) almost all of Tom Clancy's novels, and as a professional videographer, I have to say, this is a great flick.  "
dvd,13 of 16,5.0,Outrageous Fun,"I saw this movie over 15 years ago when it came out at the theater, and had a lot of fun while watching it.  Is most of it probably implausible? Yes.  But, it doesn't matter because it is fun to watch Shelley Long(Lauren) interact with Bette Midler(Sandy)."
dvd,,5.0,It will pull your heartstrings!,"  When this movie showed up on a movie channel, I almost skipped it, but I am so glad that I didn't! I enjoyed the characters so much, including the insane little seeing eye b*tch! There were so many feelings involved. The film was funny, a little crazy, touching, sad, and very, very moving. I loved getting to know the Russian or Ukrainian people and their culture; the old as well as the new. "
dvd,,4.0,surprisingly doesn't stink,"I read the horrific reviews for this when it came out, and managed to miss it (It was in and out of theaters in about six minutes)  I saw it when it came out on DVD and actually liked it enough to pick up a copy to go with my copy of the original.  Part of the fun of the original is not just Sharon Stone's witty ""you know you want to *bleep* me"" performance, but watching Michael Douglas start swallowing scenery whole when he realises that Sharon's walked away with the movie."
dvd,6 of 7,2.0,Who are these people who thought this was good?,It's a bunch of 30-40 year olds with sagging skin pretending to get it on.  Nothing erotic here.  Not even funny acting.  Do yourself a favor and check out Misty Mundae for some great erotic/funny movies

dvd,4 of 6,5.0,This is The Real Deal!,"At long last, Taylor Hackford's 1986 gem about Chuck Berry comes out on DVD, and it's a grand slam!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Under-appreciated period piece,"For as much as I enjoyed the first season the second one blew it away.  This was a character-driven period (1930s) show that did what good shows should; allow you to escape into their world.  Actually, it went one step beyond and pulled you in.  The theme was good vs evil.  This is nothing new, but the way it is presented here is what makes this such a special show.  Each episode was layed with scenery, characters and dialogue that do not grow stale with repeated viewings.  If you want to compare to a more conventional show think of LOST.  Every time you watch an episode you discover something new.  The same applies here.  Although the show only lasted two seasons I will be watching for many years"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Valuable resource,"I use this DVD in a class I teach at The Universtiy of Wisconsin, Milwaukee called ""Male Identity: Education & Development"".  I love it, and it generates much discussion in class.  I highly recommend it to parents, educators, and anyone concerned about helping boys become good men"
dvd,2 of 7,5.0,Great Set,"I have seen all these films in VHS format.  Anyone who watches them can tell that Keaton was a genius as well as a great entertainer.  Others have found fault with the musical scores, especially the one that accompanies Sherlock Jr.  In my opinion, this score is wonderful.  It adds an additional layer of fun to the film.  The Club Foot Orchestra, which performs the score, should be applauded.  Silent Films should get modern scores even if it ruffles the feathers of some purists"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,History lesson,"I think this is the most historically accurate account of the reign of Elizabeth I.  Having read many accounts of this time period, I was impressed with how much detail went into recreating the actual events.  I found the commentary wonderful, but distracting.  There are no subtitles, so the commentary is spoken over the dialog.  There were also some occasions where the commentary repeated itself (same comments given for different events).  I think you will end up watching the DVD thru first - then watching again with the commentary. "

dvd,1 of 2,2.0,"""Welcome... to myyyyy world!""","...And it isn't pretty. ""The Next Generation"" is a stain on the legacy of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. ""The Next Generation"" is a campy attempt to emulate Tobe Hooper's masterpiece , only ""The Next Generation"" has virtually no gore, creepiness, realness, grittiness, and hardly enough entertainment to keep one from falling asleep during the duration of the film. The only thing worth watching in ""The Next Generation"" is Matthew McConaughy's tongue in cheek acting as a psychopathic, sadistic, and wife beating hick. Otherwise, this poor and increasingly bizarre adaptation of TCM tries too hard to shock its audience while disintegrating into pure incomprehensible nonsense."
dvd,11 of 11,5.0,the best movie version,"I am happy to report that this is not only better than the other movie versions of The Prince and the Pauper, but that it is a very good movie.  "
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,really fun,"I saw this on the Today show and figured I would give it a shot, I get bored with exercising so I like to try new things and this is so fun I actually look forward to doing it.  The great thing is that it is only 30 minutes, I think it is great because I can fit it into my schedule and still get a great workout! It is true they don't give you great instructions but the movements are not that hard, anyone can pick it up"

dvd,,5.0,brilliant. ,"a reviewer below me called the storyline to this movie ""a jumbled mess"". oh my, how wrong he is. although, i will admit... i did not fully understand the storyline to this movie for TEN years. that doesn't mean it was a jumbled mess, though. it only means that my feeble mind wasn't able to comprehend the depth, detail and layers to it at first. so, TEN years later (2006) i watched it for what was probably the 20th odd time, and i FINALLY understood all of the twists and turns in the storyline and it all came together so beautifully. it was like poetry. it was one of those moments where you sit back and say to yourself ""how in the hell can someone write something so ingenious?"". so anyways, my point is: this movie has depth. it has layers upon layers upon layers. this is nothing like MI2 or MI3. this is a thinking-mans movie, and it is aesthetically beautiful in a very artistic way. each time you watch it, a new part of the story will reveal itself for you. and that's why i think this is the best M:I movie in the series BY FAR. compared to this one, the other two subsuquent sequals are loud, unintelligent and highly forgettable. like another reviewer said before me... this is one of the best action films i have ever seen. get it."
dvd,,5.0,I Was There!,"WOW! This brought back so many memories for me. I was shocked when a friend of mine gave me this DVD as a Christmas present because I'm the ultimate Old-School head. And to my surprise (and his) I'm in it! As the DVD plays, there are seemingly a hundred still shots of ""jams"" and ""crew pictures"" being faded in and out that give you a glimpse of our attitudes and fashions of the time. If you were there, you may spot some of your peeps. This is one of the most accurate DVDs chronicling the birth of Hip-hop, when it wasn't about the money & bling. The ""artists"" interviewed are telling the real story. A must have for all the aspiring DJ's, MC's, and dancers of today"
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Superb!,I have now seen this movie four times. A couple of hundred Amason reviews have been written - what more can I offer? I saw the movie twice in the cinema and then on DVD. It sucks you in from the start. You suffer with the characters and you cringe as you know something is about to happen and you wish it not to. Is this life not really - is it a reflection of life - Yes!
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,Sublime Crime Story with a Delicate Touch...,"Read My Lips brings the audience's attention to a young hearing-impaired secretary, Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who is embarrassed of her handicap, which she hides behind her long unfashionable hair.  Unnoticed by her coworkers Carla finds that they frequently use her desk as a trashcan to discard half-empty paper cups.  The only time the coworkers seem to recognize her is during the lunch hour when they make crude sexual jokes about her, which they keep in between themselves.  However, Carla knows that the coworkers use her for their personal enjoyment as she possess the ability to read lips, which functions as a double edge sword as her knowledge of their thoughts continues to harm her already low self-esteem."

dvd,,5.0,Delightful and well balanced,"Having visited St. Petersburg, Russia a year ago, I could not pass up the chance to watch this movie.  I must say, it was nicely done.  I can relate to the obnoxious, business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip.  I was more like the care-free younger brother, but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed.  The scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although I wish there were more because the city is full of beauty.  And this goes for the women as well!!  I mainly went to see the city...but I also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that I planned would be my travel companion.  What I didn't expect was to really fall in love :-).  The BIG reason why I confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to American women...as if explained in the additional extras on the DVD...but the Russian lady that I met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking!!  One thing I should add though.  The movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself.  Such is not the case.  It takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months, but it is more like a year.  It is time consuming to get her a US visa.  But she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover, the wait is worthwhile.  Another word of caution:  Prepare yourself to fall in love with Russia...the people are very nice and I know of a lot of Americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now"

dvd,22 of 24,4.0,The World According to Bush,"Although my Panasonic DVD recorder/player was unable to ""read"" this disc, thus viewed it om my computor (a minor inconvienience), I found this to be a serious and well-done documentary...one that we all should see and share with everyone we know.  Where ""Fahrenheight 9/11"" was well-done for entertainment as well as information, this French film-maker created a documentary that delves more into the Bush Family history which is important to know in order to better understand where G.W. is coming from. "
dvd,,5.0,Great Holiday Entertainment!,"This is a great step back in time - and wonderful ""feel good"" entertainment for the holidays"
dvd,9 of 10,5.0,DESTINED TO BECOME A CLASSIC,"Some reviewers have said this is an ""anti-war"" movie. That may be optimistic. Maybe it is a movie about the misery of being a submariner on a suicide mission near the end of a war they know has been lost. But I think director Wolfgang Petersen tried and succeeded in presenting an honest portrayal of the once proud German ""wolf pack"" U-boat hunters of the sea who would sink anything afloat for the Fatherland."
dvd,14 of 14,5.0,Tending the Lord's Flock . . . French-style,"Geraldine Granger, played with zany inspiration by Dawn French, is everything Dibley convention dictates its village pastor should not be:  boisterous, profane, irreverent, caustic, unabashedly libidinous, hopelessly unable to pass up a meal or a drink, and . . . female.  And she is all these things with such relish and verve that it takes the villagers a while to understand that she is also everything a good pastor should be:  kind, caring, patient, and -- while occasionally wilfully confused about the letter of dogma -- infinitely suffused with the spirit of Christ's message."
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Claire Forlani... Wow!,"There is alot to say about this fine movie (my thanks to the director, Martin Brest for slowing things down ), but I'll focus on the big impact for me - Claire Forlani and her complete, breathtaking beauty. Claire Forlani in her evening gown at the end of the movie is one of the most powerful images of femininity I can recall - the way she looks, the way she moves, her control, lack of control, and the things she says, are all stunning to behold. "
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,Classic,We'll keep this one simple:
dvd,25 of 25,5.0,Important History,"It was on a cold January day in 1988 that I first saw 28 Up on PBS in Central Indiana and later 35 Up in the theater in Seattle with 42 Up, like most people these days - on video at home. My point is that there is a personal history in this series that goes from the participants and producers to the public."
dvd,,1.0,Even a great cast can't help a bomb,"Wow, what a stinker! Kevin Kline, Harvey Keitel and Alan Rickman can't save this movie.  Poorly written, poorly directed, and terribly acted.  One would expect Rod Steiger to go over the top, but Danny Aiello is just as bad.  Stay away from this.  I paid about $2 for the DVD and felt I overpaid.  Hard to believe I wasted perfectly good electricity to witness this drivel.  Did I mention the movie was lousy"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wow.  Surprise.  IT was great!,"I thought of seeing this in theatres but didn't, I thought of renting this right when it came out but I didn't.  Then finally as some kind of blessing my local Mr. Movies ran out of X-Men 3 and I found myself without a movie.  I browsed the aisles, but didn't find anything........then I saw it!  Good Night, and Good Luck.  "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Another Fine Addition to this Series,"This new set of mysteries is of the same high quality as the previous ones and also, like them,  requires that you pay attention if you want to follow the rather complex plots and characters.  It is well worth the effort and while I was disappointed at first when Troy did not appear, the new sidekick is, in my view, a worthy successor and definitely grows on you.  His personality is different from Troy's--a little less naive and a bit more cocky--and his humor, as noted in a previous review, is more sardonic but I find that I like him equally well.  In all, an excellent continuation of a first-rate series. As a postscript, I might add that my only real complaint is, as it has been from the first, that the characters of Barnaby's wife and daughter seem pretty perfunctory and not a little boring, but fortunately, they do not usually play a big role in the stories"
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,A little melodramatic... but so am I,"Being a straight guy, I can't really appreciate this from the viewpoint of a woman or a gay person, the two kinds of people that this movie tries to empower. But I have been the victim of unrequited love, having fallen for a girl who, ironically enough, left me for another girl (go figure). "
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Superb Movie-Well put together-Convincing,"Out of 5 stars, I give it a 10. If you haven't seen it, you're missing the past two decades."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Warners' best Film Noir set yet!,"Border Incident starts off in the typical `Your Government Working For You' fashion that makes so many noirs start at a crawl before finally getting into the story. The dialogue feels like it hasn't just been approved by every law enforcement body in America and Mexico but written by them as well. At first it looks like Anthony Mann's style will never surface through the MGM production line sheen, but having got the advertorial exposition out of the way he seems to gradually wrest control away from the suits the further away he gets from them on location until it's definitely a Mannly film, and one that offers a direct point of transition between his noirs and his dark psychological westerns. By the time its ill-starred characters have moved from a secure world of visual order and perfectly composed balance and traversed a hostile landscape as desolate as the people-smugglers' morality to end up in one of Mann's beloved mountain/canyon shootouts, there's no doubt who is calling the shots."
dvd,8 of 43,1.0,Journey Toward Creation,"I read all of the reviews presented and purchased the video based on those reviews.  Unfortunately, I must say that our family was very disappointed with the video.  It claims to be made by a Christian company (not certain) called Reasons to Believe but in the first 30 minutes of viewing the film, there is no mention of God and the subject matter tends to lead the viewer away from the Biblical creation.  The statements made by Dr. Hugh Ross are not even close to being Biblical.  Everything mentioned went against the Bible's creation.  For any Christian thinking about purchasing this film, I would not recommend it.  I would, though, highly recommend the Moody &quot;Journey to the Edge of Creation&quot; videos.  There are two in the series, &quot;Our Solar System&quot; and &quot;The Milky Way &amp; Beyond.&quot; The photography is fantastic and the message is clear...our universe is made on a grand design.

dvd,11 of 15,2.0,Pan-rated. Television movie of the week. ,"There is an old saying, if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. But I feel compelled to critique this film, partly because I really liked what I think it was trying to say... Follow your heart, not what's necessarily popular, follow a Bohemian lifestyle if that what makes you happy. O.K. "

dvd,1 of 10,5.0,"Love, Hate, and the Fear In Between",This microcosm of the our society and psyche shows we have a long way to go before we honestly and fairly treat each other as individuals. It is an extraordinary movie because it looks at social issues with the power of cinema - and without Hollywood's mediocrity and fear of viewers and truth. WATCH THIS MOVIE
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,Too true to Life,"I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and ""must watch"". That is how good it is"
dvd,8 of 8,4.0,"""...I am your captain, your judge, and your jury.""","Charles Laughton is unforgettable as the ruthless Captain Bligh, who is ordered in late 1787 to take the Bounty, a British naval ship, to the island of Tahiti in the South Seas to gather breadfruit trees that'll be transplanted to the West Indies and served as food for the slaves. But the mission is doomed from the start because of Captain Bligh's intolerable cruelty to his crew and fellow officers, including Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable). "

dvd,2 of 3,2.0,Over-Acted.,"I'll tell you the truth - I purchased this film only so I could say I now own every movie Alan Rickman has ever done.

dvd,2 of 4,2.0,bidi bidi we have trouble Buck,"I gave this a 2 star review not because I don't like the series but the way the disks were processed. DVD-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most. I have purchased other universal shows which had less problems. Airwolf, The A Team, ect. The only saving grace is I have a number of dvd players so I have managed to salvage all or most of the BR episodes. Why put all of the episodes on 5 disks? To save money but they charge big bucks for the sets"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Authentic Feel,"First of all, I am a fan of Zhang Ziyi.  Furthermore, the movie has a Chinese (Mandarin) and Korean combined audio track giving it an authentic feel to it.  Finally, the action scene at the mud castle was riveting.  This is an excellent addition to my foreign collection"
dvd,4 of 8,5.0,Something smells rotten in Manhattan!,"This is one of Allen's  most heavy weight films. He focuses with the avidness of an entomologist in the intimate life of a famous and distinguished doctor who carries an apparent and normal life who makes a tearful speech about the God eyes but that finally the moral lessons learnt in his youth perhaps, were not enough. He presents a double life, a double moral; he is adultery and this adjective doesn't derive precisely of the word adult: he has lived a marriage through twenty years and suddenly meets a furtive, lonely and desperately lone woman Angelica Huston. He brings her back the joy for life but the things seem to be out of his control. She simply does not want to live in this way and additionally he has his hand something dirty with the administration of certain money . In the other hand we have a terrible selfish man who hires to Woody for a special documental where he will expose essentially all the concerns that have beaten Allen through his life. There will be sharp reflections about religion, art, philosophical issues. As always Woody is an irreverent and shy outlaw man who works as a journalist dealing with toxic products; as you can remember Chernobyl affair was still very fresh in the collective memory. "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"""If you could just come in on Sunday.... that'd be great....""","Ah, Office Space, one of the greatest comedies of all-time. How can you not laugh at this movie? It insults and exposes the isolation of working in a cubical in some multi-million dollar corporation, with obnoxious co-workers and a boss that overuses the word ""Yeah"". The red stapler scene is ALONE worth the price of the enitire movie. Of course, in the end we learn that everything will work out as long as you have that one co-worker who's a stuttering fat guy who can't stand up for himself who torches the entire building so he can get his stapler back.... *sarcasm*. But whatever. What can I say? It's classic humour. If you haven't seen this movie, get off your couch, stop watching that re-run of some WB drama, and rent - no, BUY this movie NOW! You'll never be able to stop watching Office Space. And for the record, this gets my vote for the best comedy of the entire 90s."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Honest, unpretentious and deeply moving...","Nostalgic, sour and powerful, Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" is one of the most memorable of all his Westerns...

In fact, John Ford couldn't have got the feeling he's after in any other way... "
dvd,2 of 2,2.0,"Great idea, poor implementation","I thought the concept for this dvd was great- choose a different workout every day, really work on toning the parts of the body I wanted when I wanted.  The other reviews seemed very promising.  So I was thrilled when I got the dvd and saw the different menus and the variety of workouts available.  The reality was a little different.  Yes, there's a great deal of variety to choose from, but the instructor has all the rhythm and charisma of a narcoleptic chartered accountant.  The routines have no rhythm- the spacing between reps was completely irregular which made it very difficult to follow the excersizes without keeping my eyes glued to the TV screen.  The workouts are performed by the instructor while a recorded-after-the-fact voice-over kind of rambles through the instruction.  It felt very awkward to try and do- there's no flow to it."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Two of Sandler's best........,"There was a time when Adam Sandler was unstoppable. After seeing the movie 'Big Daddy', I remember him achieving almost God-like status with anyone in the 12-25 age range. The guy was hilarious. I know most people are happy about the change that has come over his movies, but I hate it. It pains me to watch movies like 'Mr. Deeds', when he used to make movies like 'Billy Madison' & 'Happy Gilmore'. These two movies are Sandler doing what he does best....making people laugh."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Trippy...,"A few years before this movie came out, a movie called ""Tommy"" came out. This movie took the concept album of The Who's ""Tommy"" and transferred it to the big-screen, using only music and absolutely no dialogue to further the story along. I never turn off a movie, no matter how bad I think it is. Except ""Tommy."" In reality, the film wasn't bad...It just annoyed me. There was a huge lack of entertainment going on. I wasn't expecting much from The Wall, but I've heard so many good things about it. I had to see it. Let me say, I haven't heard a lot of Pink Floyd stuff. I've only listened to four albums (Umma Gumma, Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, and Wish You Were Here). Yes, that's right. I haven't even heard The Wall album. This film is simalar to Tommy in the fact that Pink Floyd's music plays throughout the film. The difference is, there is some dialogue in the film although it doesn't move the plot along at all. The other difference is, this film has amazing visuals and is fun to watch. The movie's plot is basically a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof) sits watching a war movie and begins to remember his childhood. Blended in is memories, fantasies, and a bunch of other [...] that results in one trippy movie to watch. But, as I said, the visuals are what keep you watching. The movie's metaphors (especially the title one) are very smart, the script is by Roger Waters (although I don't know how a person could write a script like this). If you're a Floyd fan/arty kinds of films, check this out for sure. All movies, in my opinion, are forms of art...But this film is actually like a work of art. Anyway, if you're just a moviegoer looking for some entertainment on a Saturday night...This isn't the movie for you."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,worth its flaws,"Damon and Affleck deserve all the credit they got for this script, as well as their acting.  There are flaws, however, which we can overlook, but obviously I want to list them!  That's the fun of this.  The most glaring mistake is the guy (apparently a teamster, as if they need to get overpaid any more than they already are) cast as the judge.  I've lived in Boston, and people with that accent, bordering on speech impediment, do not become judges.  They become, well, teamsters and the like.  Robin Williams is good, but this movie doesn't even need him.  Also, Minnie Driver is fairly unattractive and has an irritating way of speaking.  Stellan Skarsgaard is good as the professor, even though nobody with that eurotrash accent of his would be named ""Jerry"".  How's that for a thirty second review"

dvd,11 of 12,5.0,Magnificent transfer by Criterion,"I am not going to write about the merits of Ran, i.e., it is a given that it is perhaps Kurosawa's finest work. If you bought the previous Masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the Criterion, don't hesitate. The ""Masterworks"" transfer is a travesty compared to the Criterion. The colors just bleed in the Masterworks, whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant. On the Masterworks DVD there is a restoration demo, which I thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the Criterion. Get this DVD if you are a Kurosawa fan; you won't regret it. This is perhaps the finest Criterion DVD that I have purcased, and I own over 40 Criterions"

I even emailed Jay Ward Productions and asked about it, repeatedly, each time getting a generic ""thanks for being such a great fan"" answer, until finally one of the responses mentioned something about lawyers.  I figured that was it, until a few weeks ago I idly Googled FF and up came the complete collection collection on DVD at Amazon!  I plunked down my $$, waited breathlessly, got the package, waited for the right Fung Shui, and -- with the charged anticipation of other reviewers -- popped it in the DVD player with trembling hands.  Forty-two years after I'd last seen it.  And laughed like a maniac all over again.  Note to fellow Boomers -- it helps to have some of your favorite intoxicant on board.."

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Heaven and Hell,"The Japanese title of Kursawa's film ""High and Low"" is actually more like ""Heaven and Hell"". The intensity of the original title is probably closer to the content of this thrilling story. Set in Japan in the 1960's, early on in the film we see Japanese kids in cowboy gear running along a hilltop street. The influence of America in post-war Japan is one of the most interesting plot points: Luigi Barzini notes that after World War II both Germany and Japan emulated American styles, industry, organizational methods, cultural habits, and Barzini goes on to say that the students eventually surpassed their teacher. With this in mind, the struggle of Japan to rebuild itself after the war, and the way in which West and East seem to collide forms a fascinating frame for this story of kidnapping and extortion."

dvd,4 of 4,2.0,Hard to review this DVD,"It is very difficult to review this DVD and give it correct stars. If you consider the 2D version, it would get 4 or 5 stars as the animation and colors are wonderful with a very humorous story. BUT the 3D version is terrible. The 3D is about the worst ever, it never really produces a 3D effect and the red/blue glasses dull and changes to colors making it almost a black and white film. None of the 3D effects really work. The best of them is the falling snow. Often the viewer sees the two images ruining the whole effect and making it impossible to concentrate on the story."

dvd,2 of 3,1.0,Oh the humanity!,"There are bad movies, and then there are BAD movies. ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" is a cosmically bad movie, a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" for comparison. The first ""Universal Soldier"" film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and ""Rocky"" refugee Dolph Lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do: people perished in violent ways, stuff exploded, and Van Damme and Lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film. Even the presence of the charming Ally Walker as Van Damme's female sidekick greatly helped the film. The movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition DVD some time back. It unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel. The second, and one hopes final, installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that I sat in open-mouthed awe watching it. I think I can safely say I am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity. Expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll."
dvd,1 of 1,1.0,This is funny?,"Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick"
dvd,0 of 17,2.0,"No offense Duke, but this thing was pretty bad",No offense to the Duke--he was actually about the only good thing in this movie.  The dialogue was more like a stage play--very stilted and unrealistic.  Harry Morgan's Marshall character was an over the top joke.

dvd,15 of 15,4.0,Interesting Movie,"""Lie With Me"" is a sexually charged love story that somehow got away from the MPAA with an R rating. I think the filmmakers must be in the MPAA, because this movie's got some graphic scenes. We're talking full frontal male & female nudity, with sex that looks very unsimulated. You don't see full penetration, but...Well, you'll have to see it. This movie is adapted from a book and I hope the book had more depth than this, because I feel something must have been lost in the transition from book-to-screen. The movie is about Leila (Lauren Lee Smith), a girl a lot of people would call a ""slut."" Leila likes to have sex and she likes to have it a lot. She doesn't seem to understand love or a relationship, but she understands sex. Could this be attributed to a bad homelife? It could be, but the filmmakers don't really show her with a bad homelife. Her parents are getting divorced and her sister is about to get married, despite having had sex with her ex just a couple nights before the marriage. It's kind of bad, but not this bad. Anyway, Leila ends up at a party where she hastily drags a guy outside and begins performing oral sex on him. Meanwhile, a guy she met a few minutes ago named David (Eric Balfour, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') is sitting in a truck watching her with his girlfriend. As the girlfriend begins copying Leila and as both Leila and David have sex with their respective partners; They look at each other and something is there. They may not be sure what, but it's there. The next day, David goes looking for Leila and he finds her. She begins to masturbate on a playground for him, which freaks him out a bit, but he returns to her and they both have sex that I swear isn't simulated. There's almost no way it could be. Anyway, for some reason; We have to find out that David is caring for his invalid father. But is this really important to the plot? I mean it's a bit heartwrenching, but not very important. This movie could've poignant, but that's where it misses. The performances are good enough and the movie is entertaining; It's a vast improvement over another sexually charged movie called ""9 Songs"" (in which the sex wasn't simulated and was slightly more graphic than this). Balfour and Smith make a cute couple; The sex scenes are great. But, overall, it misses a bit. "

dvd,3 of 6,4.0,"""Have you ever killed anyone?""  ""I hurt somebody's feelings once.""","When one considers director John Frankenheimer's career, it's almost a wonder he was ranked up there with other top names of his time like Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorcese; because for as many classic hits that he turned out (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE TRAIN, BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ, GRAND PRIX & BLACK SUNDAY), there were just as many stinkers.  Anyone remember FRENCH CONNECTION II, 52 PICK-UP and a particularly bad monster movie called PROPHECY?  His 1996 remake of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU was so bad, I concluded then and there that Marlon Brando should never again be in front of the camera!  Perhaps if RONIN had been released a couple of years later, Frankenheimer's final swan song would not have been the forgettable REINDEER GAMES."

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Timeless classic,"This documentary is great. I like the humorous clips that are sprinkled throughout the movie to create the sense of Brittish culture that they came out of. I also like how the story tellers (the Pistols, McClaren, etc) are kept in sillouette. I think showing thier age would have made it a bit sad. Like when you see Axle Rose after all these years and he is not quite what he once was. And the footage of Sid shooting dope and snoring as Nancy is trying to keep him awake for an interview is absolutely fantastic. If your already reading this then this movie is a must see"

Yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great. Its not suppose to be realistic. Its fiction! I just realized too that the daughter is the girl from American Pie which makes it even funnier. Overall this movie is pretty good. If you dont care for the story, atleast get it to see Kim and the other chicks in the movie. If you've never seen the movie, just buy it. Its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it. For all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues!   "
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Compare and contrast,"The 'spotlight' reviews of The Maltese Falcon (1941) are on the money.  It remains a remarkably modern, cynical film that holds up very well today.

Mysteries in particular were typically slow moving films with too much comedy thrown in for light relief.  The Huston version of The Maltese Falcon changed everything."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Manhattan,"Very rarely has a film been as fiercely personal as Woody Allen's Manhattan, it describes a time and place that is at once distant and in immediate reach, and the film is both timely and eternal. The opening of the film is spectacular, Woody shoots New York City in confident and uncompromising first-person beautiful black and white, the sounds of Gershwin sending waves of radiation throughout the screen as Allen narrates the first chapter of the book he is attempting to write. Right away we know that Woody Allen has something to say, something at once simple and unbelievably complex, about a city he loves, the women he's loved and himself. Far from being as cathartic in nature as Husbands And Wives or Hannah And Her Sisters though, the subject of the film is not Woody Allen or Manhattan, it is Manhattan seen and heard through the eyes and ears of the greatest working American director, a glorified, sweeping vision of a place that is unbelievably Romantic and yet dragged down by the constant reminders of reality. As Allen's character struggles between the radiating purity of his 17 year old girlfriend and the seductive manipulation and quasi-intellectual rhetoric of his friend's mistress, Woody the filmmaker struggles between autobiography of himself or portrait of a city, before deciding to use one to get to the other, and constructing out of the film a journey from these two points. It is interesting to compare Allen's film to perhaps the most significant attempt at the same idea,  Fellini's ode to Rome, Fellini Roma. Although Manhattan is infinitely more idealistic than Roma,  the two filmmakers face a similar dilemma, to create poems to a city, while talking about themselves. The two visions could not be more different. While Fellini painted a monochrome chaotic picture of disaster and shattered life in a whirlwind of misplaced joy, Allen dwells on what he calls the `hustle-bustle' of the city, and romanticizes it. While Fellini shoots in color, Allen shoots in black and white, while Fellini finds death at the origin of his city, Allen finds life. As it is Manhattan is neither autobiography nor portrait of a time or place but the midway point between the two, which reunites them and makes the two inseparable."

dvd,1 of 3,5.0,The One N Only -Gigglez,"I love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways...thats where i got my nickname(giggles).I can really relate to Sad Girl .My friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching it..we all relate to it, like mousie,sadgirl,whisper,sleepy,ernesto,blueeyes.We enjoy it.Every one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life"
dvd,35 of 35,5.0,Cute,"Who says Drew Barrymore ruined this adorable Christmas story?  Her voice was appropriate for the insecure, but sweet dog name Olive, who believes Santa needs her help to save Christmas.  Hearing an announcement that Santa needs all of the other reindeer to help him, believing it meant ""Olive, the other reindeer"", Olive sets off to the North Pole to find Santa.  So begins this little dog's journey.  The illustrations are simplistic, but charming, especially when you see the flying sleigh being pulled by the reindeer and a little dog, being dragged along, flapping her pizza box wings.  Sure to be a classic like Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer, Miracle on 34th Street, and White Christmas"
dvd,3 of 5,2.0,"This video is good enough, and that's it.","This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout.  I still think the moves work, but I'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me"
dvd,4 of 7,1.0,CAN'T FIND A GOOD SLEEPING PILL? THAN BUY THIS MOVIE!,"Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the ""One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era."" line on this back of this movie case.  I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99.  It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is.  I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times.  If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento.  Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible.  Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles.  The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language"
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Amazing film,"Storm is one of my favorites of the Warren Miller series, with absolutely amazing skiing and boarding in incredible locations. (Alaska heliskiing and the South Georgia Island ones are my favorites) The scenes are beautifully shot and really take your breath away. I have to hand it to the Warren Miller team, in that it can't be easy to film these every year and still put out a film that has such an emotional impact for anyone who has been out in the mountains. As a Colorado native, watching this movie makes me want to pack up and head for the deep powder - a fantastic movie that will leave you with a serious travel/ski bug"
dvd,2 of 20,1.0,Lame,"It's been about 7 or so years as far as I can remember since I last saw South Park, and I have to say, I just remember it being more funny.  This movie was unbearably lame."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Disney's labor of love,"""Walt Disney Treasures Silly Symphonies"" is a priceless collection of historical Disney cartoons ranging from the more primitive black and white animated shorts of the early 1930's to Disney's more sophisticated color cartoons which began to appear in the mid-1930's."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A VINTAGE CRAWFORD AND GABLE DELIGHT,"Back in 1933, this was a huge hit: moviegoers rushed to see two of Hollywood's most popular stars co-cast in a musical comedy-drama! Crawford plays beautiful Janie Barlow, an ambitious dancer who wants to rise to the top with class and dignity. As Patch Gallagher, the show director, Gable plays it rough and sexy: the two generate a lot of electrical currents together and their off-Screen attraction for each other is quite obviously evident. The original story for this film - which introduced the Three Stooges to film - was a serial published in THE SATURDAY EVENING POST. Gable was supposedly ill during production due to a leg condition known then as ""toxic leg"": he had an appendectomy.....As ""punishment"" for holding up the production, Louis B. Mayor later loaned him out to Columbia for IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. But Gable got the last laugh: he won the Oscar! Some sources state the reason for the above scenerio was Gable's refusal to do another ""tough guy"" role. Who knows? THE RHYTHM OF THE DAY sequence is brilliantly imaginitive. This film served as the film debut of a 35 year-old hoofer. His name was Fred Astaire"
dvd,6 of 11,1.0,Don't waste your money / A little bit rip-off,"I cannot tell you what a disappointment this DVD release is. I have been waiting anxiously for this show to be released on DVD. I was thrilled when I found out that the same company who put out the Tony Orlando & Dawn show was doing it. I was expecting the same top notch treatment for D&M. Not so. Talk about cutting corners. This is the best they could do? This DVD has so little on it and I feel ripped off having spent $30. If this set is what future volumes of the D&M show are going to be, I certainly will not be buying anymore. Not only that, I will be very careful when buying future releases from this company as well. What the hell happened? It is puzzling that Donny himself was very involved in this release. Donny, do you need the money so badly that you've resorted to ripping off your fans? Shame on you and a BIG shame on the company that put this piece of garbage out. To those who have not thrown their money away yet, take my word for it, don't bother"
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,Global Warming That Melts The Heart,Ice Age and Ice Age 2: The Meltdown are 20th Century Fox's CGI successes. Both movies warm the heart; they make you appreciate the value of friends and family; they teach good morals. They are class-A family films (with the all important adult-asides).

dvd,,2.0,"KATHY SMITH: CHOPPY, LOUD AND TERRIBLE!!",I agree with June 26 review....except I am going to say it better...her instruction---SUCKS!
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Red Hot!,"In Bob Rafelson's (FIVE EASY PIECES) 1981 remake of the 1946 version of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE starring John Garfield and Lana Turner from the novel by James Cain, he made a brilliant decision in his selection of Jack Nicholson as the drifter Frank Chambers-- when he was still young enough and handsome enough to be believable as a red hot lover-- and Jessica Lange as Cora Papadakis who is married to the older Greek Nick (John Colicos) and is a fuse just waiting to be ignited; and burn she does."
dvd,,5.0,Great Movie,"I was so captivated by the movie that I immediately wanted the DVD after I saw the adverts! AND the movie turned out to be fabulous, just as good as the adverts said. THe dance scenes are fantastic with the aid of real ballerinas from the New York city ballet. The DVD comes with extra features too. You can also play the movie in a lot of languages. However, like any other movie, this one has flaws too. THe ending when Genevieve gets married to Derek is a bit weak and awkard. Nevertheless, I recommend this movie to EVERYONE. "
dvd,2 of 11,2.0,Dull and boring. This 'Trick' should refund your money...,"Like most indie gay themed movies, ""Trick"" had quite a bit of buzz around it. A terrific movie with Tori Spelling! How could I not love it?  I loved ""Die Mommy, Die!"", ""Girls Will Be Girls"", and ""Jeffrey"". So I gotta love this too, right? Right??"
dvd,7 of 13,2.0,What a Shame,I love AITF. Always have. And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,"Barcelona, a comedy after Jane Austin","As the film opens, we are told that this is the last decade of the cold war. There is a shot of a rather unimpressive explosion at the American Library and of a young Spaniard throwing a rock through the window of a small IBM office. It seems an odd note on which to begin a romantic comedy, and delivered in un-scored, still-shots quickly falls to the background where, of course, it subtly colors almost every other incident in the film."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,The OC,"Being a fan of the show I have a bias toward everything about it, but still watching each episode with the option of commentary for some episodes, it was great to hear what the creator of the show had to say about the episode as it went through. Hearing about the background that they used for a scene, or why they did this and that; it was a different view of some of the best episodes from both season 1 & 2. Even wo/ the commentary, each episode was great in it's own individual way. Quality wise, it was awesome. I watched every one on my computer, because my TV in college does not have DVD, and still the quality was just unbelieveble. Even the boxes, and the packaging of the DVD's blew me away. It's not too late to jump on ""The OC"" yet, and if you're a true fan of the show like me you should not even think twice about getting the first 2 seasons if ya haven't already"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,no title,"This was a wonderful little film, with much the same feel and flavor of ""Hear My Song"", and also the same actor, Adrian Dunbar.  Of course, the plot and scenery were different, but still, it had that same ""feel good"" impression at the end.  Hard to believe that Mia Farrow is 49 years old here.  She sure looks terrific.  And I love anything Joan Plowright (Lawrence Olivier's widow) is in; she's just marvelous.  Set in 1926, the costumes are exquisite.  I had guessed the outcome of the mystery, but that made it no less enjoyable.  I have seen the guy who played the dentist before, just can't remember where.  There were lots of wonderful comic lives that made you laugh out loud; such as England exists just as a place for the Irish to send their unwed mothers (this was set in Ireland).  The plot twist was a good one, but Natasha Richardson (late of ""The White Countess"") overplayed her part a tad too much; otherwise, I might not have guessed it.  It was set in a time and place and way of life we'll never see again, a quieter time, a lovely time.  We have speeded up our world too much.  And you could see it coming here, as Plowright's car speeds along, knocking people down, in the opening scene. "

dvd,,4.0,Natural Killers With An Agenda  ~  Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Go In The Water Again,"The `Deep Blue Sea' released in '99 is an highly entertaining action film that pushes all the right emotional panic buttons and delivers a suspenseful thriller pitting a band of marine scientists against one of mankinds' most feared enemies, the shark. "
dvd,0 of 7,5.0,Join The U.S. Air Force And Get Chicks!!!That's The Fantasy!,In this movie a young Richard Gere joins the Air Force in the hope of a beter life. The girls who live near the base camp are willing to do anything to get to marry a Naval Aviator.Sadly Richard and his best friend do not see past the deceptiveness of these  two girls played by Deborah Wiger and Lisa Blount. This movie seems to be sending out the message that if you are a woman trapped in a tedious job then all you gotta do is find a successful guy to rescue you from your life. Gee. I though  that concept went out the window back in the days of Knights In Shining Armour Rescuing Poor Damsels In Distress. I give this movie 5 stars because it is a another sad attempt by Hollywood to portray Fantasy as Reality
dvd,,5.0,Great Movie,"Conservatvie family meets the new boyfriend. He does not live up to their expetations in the slightest, but he does love their daughter.  See the push and pull of a crazy conservative father checking out his daughters new boyfriend.  He is trying to make a good impression, but nothing goes right even though his heart is in the right place.  the sequel to this movie is meet the fockers.  See this movie first and then that.  The next movie is more funny if you see this one first"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Pre-Samurai Mifune,"Released in 1949-this movie stars Toshiro Mifune in one of his earliest roles as Tokyo cop Murakami, who's gun is stolen which leads to his relentless drive to recover the weapon-which is being used in a crime spree."
dvd,3 of 7,2.0,Cheesy !,"The Tick was excellent as a cartoon. In fact the animated series might have been one of the greatest modern day cartoons. This live action series simply feels like a wannabe, it's not even close to as good as the cartoon. It feels right as a cartoon, but as a live action series, it just feels cheesy or something like a hipper version of the power rangers"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Old-Fashioned Adventure Tale,"Here's an ""epic"" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as ""The Mummy."" Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them."
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,dolly's valley aint blue!,this movie was on lifetime and i thought it was great. then i bought the dvd and it's super-spectacular. she does a nice accoustic version of &quot;wildflowers&quot; and there's this weird easter egg where if you hilite her eyes and press enter then you hear only the music and the soundeffects. pretty strange
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Congrats to Elton John!,"There is nothing I enjoy better than watching beautiful people strunt their graceful moves and excellent dance techniques to music. I hold the line at smut, but I do enjoy clean yet sexy dance moves. "
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,If only time stood still...,"Cameron Crowe is my all time favorite director. His films are inspirational, moving, and fun. 'Say Anything...', the ultimate handbook to relationships. 'Jerry Maguire', the guidelines to life and where happiness belongs. 'Almost Famous', a visual song, or concert that just opened up our eyes...to Crowe and music, in general. But, what about 'Singles?'"
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Excellent video for weight loss or just low energy/hypothyroid,"As a yoga therapist, I really think this video holds a lot of help for people, especially women, who suffer from fatigue, low energy, hypo thyroid and/or weight loss.  Kundalini has a long history of keeping the endocrine system--adrenals, pituitary, pineal, thyroid glands--healthy and functioning smoothly.  "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0, Sunrise...sunset...,"I spent part of the afternoon out at the theatre, watching Mission: Impossible III...but I'm not here to write about that, or about getting a new battery in my watch, or about picking up the chicken and green onions and mushrooms that are now baking away in the oven."
dvd,5 of 5,5.0,The Best Movie of the 90's,"Remains of the Day joins Goodfellas and Breaking the Waves as movies that did not win Best Picture Oscars in the 90's, however will be be remembered as truly three of the finest flims ever produced. Merchant and Ivory has always been an aquried taste, however this movie truly crosses all boundries. As the years go by (I'm writing this review in 2005), Anthony Hopkins brillance as an actor gets dimmed somewhat with every mediorce script he takes, although if anyone has earned the right to sell out for money, it is he and Deniro."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Ed Bradley On Tiger Woods,Ed bradley at his best in a smooth one on one insight into the world of tiger woods. No one interviews like Ed bradlely. Tiger is at his most comfortable and therefore his most open as he and Bradley opens doors into what motivates Tiger. Not to be missed.
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,A highly original Western comedy...,"A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy..."
dvd,2 of 7,5.0,La Historia de un Equipo Grande,"Un DVD, para apasionados a los Malosos de Oakland, sencillamente formidabl"
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,Shining goodness and purity,"This film incredibly touched my heart showing true goodness and depth from a source many would instead link to self-centerness and ditsyness, the most popular girl in school. She uses her popularity for goodness and has real love for others in every situation, although sometimes at expense of her own happiness, but it isn't false as she also her all the range of normal emotions with all the doubts, anger and all but makes the right and good decisions of love and concern for others instead. Even eventually realizing happiness for herself is possible while caring for and helping others. An amazingly well done and realistic a touchingly practical idealist that I can relate to deeply including the struggles of being truly good to others and selfless while not neglecting oneself, nor falling to selfishness. A lovely film of beauty, compassion and shining purity"
dvd,5 of 6,5.0,Cute but predictable :->,"When this first came out, I watched it so often.  It's still a good movie although obviously outdated in more ways than one."

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Memories......,"Oh, how I remember rushing home from school to be able to catch the next episode of my most favorite TV series ever.  I ran home, like most of us did, in the fifties when there were no chauferred drives to and from school.  Mom was there chiding about ""do your homework first"" knowing that would be impossible...""SPIN AND MARTY are on mom!!!  I'll do my homework the minute it's over, I promise""!"

dvd,11 of 12,5.0,"You're Not Too Smart, Are You? I Like That In A Man.","I don't want to age myself--but I fell in love with this movie when it came out some 25 years ago.  I have owned both the VHS and the cheapie DVD and have seen the film dozens of times through the years.  While I was thrilled to see a Deluxe Edition headed my way--in truth, the features don't really seem all that Deluxe.  Disappointing, really, but with this film I'll take anything I can get."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Teenager vs Goblin King,"A young girl is tired of her stepmother and her new baby half-brother.  But when she makes a comment that she wants the Goblin King to take her brother, it really happens.  She is visited by the King (David Bowie) and learns that if she can get to his castle at the center of the labyrinth in thirteen hours, she will have the chance to get her brother back.  She starts out and quickly learns that things are very different and that things are not fair.  But ,fair or not, she needs to learn how to be unfair as well in order to penetrate the labyrinth."
dvd,11 of 16,1.0,Not worth it,"There are sometimes humorous situations in the life of an active member of the LDS Church, including home teaching, but this movie is an extremely poor attempt to portray them. The characters are not authentic active members (that is, the only ones that actually DO home teaching). One of them can't wait to get out of church to watch football games on Sunday, while the other (portrayed as the ""spiritual one"" in some reviews) is depicted as a ""letter-of-the-law"" fanatic that will insist in visiting all families even if is the last day of the month, but will use the visits to promote and sell the Scripture CDs which are his business. The ""comic"" situations are highly exagerated, and for long stretches nothing interesting happens. It is said that this movie was done very quickly, which is evidenced by its poor quality."
dvd,4 of 10,2.0,Not really intermediate,"Could have been better. Now that i am definitely in need of advanced, leave alone intermediate, it was a disappointment. It gave only a couple of very basic inverted poses and that is all. I wish for a more advanced program with advanced versions of all poses and inverted poses"
dvd,2 of 6,1.0,Go home Smith,This is a terrible missues of one of Asimovs greatest novels. The relevance to the novel is only marginal.  
dvd,5 of 8,5.0,Powerful and Moving,"Russell Crowe gives one of the best performances ever making this a great epic on the large scale and at the same time an epic for the common man. Here is an epic motion picture that makes you think and feel, cheer and cry. We must all face our burden no matter how cruel and when the dust settles we close our eyes and our dreams may come true"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,A GIANT OMISSION,While I agree with all of the positive reviews and what has been said. What I disagree with is what HASN'T BEEN SAID!..No one seemed to notice the wonderful performance of Marjorie Reynolds...What a dancer and her scene of White Christmas with der Bingle is just pure charm..She was not at all intiminated performing with two of the Giants of Show Biz..She held her own in the singing department and EXCELLED in the dance numbers..

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A jolly good show,"Moving, intelligent, realistic, not overly acted (as could quite easily have been the case)."
dvd,13 of 18,2.0,Spooked a 2-year Old,"When this DVD was first watched, the adults in our household thought that these Winnie the Pooh stories did a very good job introducing ghosts to the 23 1/2 month old in the house.  However, in recent days we have decided to hide this movie because it has caused the 23 1/2 month old to worry about ghosts now, even though we told her and she agrees with us verbally that ghosts are not real.  This little girl is an avid movie watcher and has an amazing concentration level when it comes to watching them.  Unfortunately she has internalized this one and now will not go to bed in her room at night alone.  And she has never had a problem going to bed before.  Parents beware of this DVD, just because it is Pooh does not mean it is totally harmless to impressionable little minds"
dvd,5 of 8,5.0,One of the Best,"I've watched it 4 times, and am ready for the fifth. Up there "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Best adaptation yet,"I have the movie on VHS and now I found the DVD version.  I have never seen the 1939 version with Merle Oberon, but I read and re-read the novel several times and this is defintley not a star-crossed love story like Romeo and Juliet."
dvd,6 of 7,4.0,Fairy tales may come true if you 're young at heart!,"May be you don' t believe it, but from time to time, there are certain poetic films that would seem to recover its majesty even in the most unexpected circumstances. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,INCREDIBLE,"This set is absolutely incredible!  Every single pitch of the '79 World Series is here.  I was 12 when I last saw these games, and viewing them again has brought back so many memories.  From Stargell's dingers and Teke's funky deliver, to that weird rainbow head guy behind the plate in Baltimore.  It all came back to me the instant I saw it again.  Unlike today, all the players seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely, even when they were playing hurt.  And the comradarie between the two teams is refreshingly evident.  If you're interested in baseball (even a little bit), I highly recommend this.  If you're like Howard Cosell, who seemed more interested in arguing with Drysdale and checking out the player's wives, you won't be disappointed either.  These DVD's will get me through at least 2 or 3 more sub .500 Pirates seasons"
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,Cry Baby ( Director's Cut),"Definitely one of the best. Johnny Depp is great as Wade Cry Baby Walker. There is great music, great scenes. It is just a fun film all aroun"

dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Good overall on the edge of your seat  video ,this movie is a great movie for those how like movie on millitary and sub's. this movie keeps u thinking all the way through it and wondering what will happen next.Sean Connery as always was a great actor in this film and so was Alec Baldwin. I would just sugest it to just about anyone and definetly military lovers. 
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,The Mark Of Zorro in origianl B&W and Color Also,FOX has done an excellent job with this release of the Mark of Zorro. This is a two sided disc. The one side has the movie in its origianl Black and White release. The other side has the movie colorized. 
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Limits Are Tested,"Following in the footsteps of Tales of Tomorrow, the original The Outer Limits was a landmark show.  Many years later a creative team decided to resurrect the feel of the show and this is the result.  As pointed out in one of the many extras, this is not The Twilight Zone.  That show relied heavily on fantasy while this one would be grounded in science."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Unsettling foreign psychodrama,"""The Vanishing"" the 1988 French thriller directed by George Sluizer is a film superior to the over embellished Hollywood version starring Jeff Bridges which was also directed by Sluizer.  The film's appeal is in its simplicity in creating a tension filled experience based of the strongly developed highly motivated main characters, Rex and Raymond who are both portrayed eloquently. The maniacal manner is which both characters act out their fixations make for a powerful collision when they ultimately meet. "
dvd,2 of 15,1.0,Unable to review,"Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie"
dvd,,4.0,The writer who got close to the story.,"To truly get a good sense of this film, you should see the movie IN COLD BLOOD (1967) first, starring Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.  The true story is based upon the real killers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock that Truman Capote wrote about in his nove ""In Cold Blood""."
dvd,9 of 12,4.0,Badly acted etc. but also quite unique and strangely compelling!,"In 1840 the small seaside town of Dante's Cove was awash in strange goings on. Grace Neville (Traci Scoggins) is about to be married to a young Ambrosius (William Gregory Lee). Although she's getting on in years, Grace is now sure she's finally met the man that she wants to settle down with. Is Ambrosius, however, really all that he appears or does he just want Grace for her money? "

dvd,,5.0,Best Price ANYWHERE!,"Newly released and a discount price unmatched ANYWHERE.  Shipped and received exactly when stated, and the quality of the item was perfect.  This is a must have for any serious Inuyasha fan, and collector.  Clean enough for most children and enough depth of entertain even an adult"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Great show!,Escaflowne was probably the first anime show I ever watched!  I was instantly hooked and just had to buy it now even though it's been several years since I saw the show.
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"""I'm just a small-town cop. Mostly, I give out parking tickets.""","I'm a big fan of Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone series (5 novels so far) and was curious to see how Tom Selleck would fare in the lead role of Stone Cold. Going into this television movie, I had some doubts because Selleck didn't really mesh with the mental image I had of Jesse. To me, the great thing about Jesse Stone had always been the fact that he was this unassuming, average-looking guy with unsuspected balls of steel, and I thought Tom Selleck, with his commanding presence (and trademark mustache), would take that bit of magic away from Jesse. But I guess I worried for nothing. Tom Selleck turns out to be excellent as the savvy, complex, and stoic police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts. The author had always depicted Jesse as a flawed human being, still struggling with his inner demons, namely his obsession with his ex-wife (who keeps calling him), which then ties into his drinking problem. Yet, somehow, Jesse still finds the strength somewhere to do the right thing, even if it means circumventing certain rules and policies here and there. Tom Selleck brings all of Jesse's baggage to the screen with an effectively low-key but layered performance. Even though  his character is a man of few words, Selleck still manages to convey the deep emotions being kept in check underneath the police chief's poker-faced demeanor. Jesse also ends up with the driest, funniest one-liners in the movie, most of 'em lifted straight off the pages of the book.  "
dvd,,4.0,Good for kids 5 and up,"My four year old was very distracted by the dog and gorilla, and the pace of the movie was too fast for him.  He didn't ""get it"" and he couldn't talk coherently about the three types of people (don't knows, kinda knows, etc) after watching it.  The humor was too bizarre and too distracting.  It's probably very good for older kids, though"
dvd,1 of 5,2.0,There's a reason this went straight to DVD...,"...It's not very good.  Like the blind sheep I am, I bought this movie on Amazon based on the (mostly) glowing reviews it garnered, which is fairly rare for a straight-to-DVD horror movie.  Now I really wish I had saved my $20.  Although it was great to see Bruce Campbell in a film again (for his five minutes, anyway), his cameo wasn't enough to make this film likeable - nor was Patricia Clarkson's well-acted turn as the headmistress.  The movie began well, but it soon disintegrated into a snooze-fest.  I found the pseudo-1965 theme to be irritating because, for the most part, the dialogue and attitudes of the main characters did not seem true to ""period"" to me.  The plot was cheesy, disconnected at times, and strung out with a hurried and fairly predictable ending.  I suppose the production is fairly good, but it's not anything you haven't seen before.  "

dvd,15 of 15,4.0,"Incredible technique, aristically good also","Despite his grotesque and faked stage mannerisms, Lang Lang's performance are poetic and thoughtful.  Such is the case with his Abegg variations as well as his somewhat mannered yet full bodied Chopin Nocturne.  As for the Liszt, Lang Lang concerns himself with the episodic details rather than the structural whole (which is fine depending on one's tastes).  Other pianists may have better interpretations (Arrau, Richter), but Lang Lang is growing as an individual artist.  "

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,The Zombie movie you thought you had seen but didn't is here!,"	The Dead Next Door is another fine addition to the Zombie genre.  If you were to place this in terms of acting and film quality, it would have to fall somewhere between Night and Dawn of the dead, but leaning more towards night.  Apparently this film was shot, written, and  produced by a then 18-year-old Bookwalter, which in and of itself is worthy of a viewing.  The plot needs almost no explaining:  zombies walk amongst us, and their legions are growing.  In this film, however, we get organized zombie squads that work out of D.C. and patrol the nearby neighboring states.  Like in The Omega Man, it is implied that science was the cause and could be the cure for the undead problem.  The storyline itself is both irreverent and cynical, full of stupid people doing stupid things.  One of the best parts is when a group of protesters sporting Let The Dead Walk signs gets attacked by the very creatures they were trying to protect.  There are even zombie cults and zombie sacrifices.  Gore-mongers won't be disappointed either:  the special effects, although coming close but not quite equaling such maestros as Romero or Fulci, are still capable of dropping open the jaw.  DVD extras are very formidable:  interviews, deleted scenes, alternate takes, photo galleries and behind the scenes footage, to name but some of the included treasure trove here.  Shot in suburban Ohio, this is a true independent film and deserves to be respected on that merit. "
dvd,2 of 15,2.0,"SICKENING, MALE-BASHING SESSION","Are you a woman who believes that every guy is a jerk, adulterer or potential murderer? Then SHORT CUTS is for you. You can sit back and reinforce your prejudices, yelling ""Right on!"" at the screen every two minutes. What we have here is not a collection of short stories so much as a collection of drunks, cheats, killers and insensitive morons. One wonders if Robert Altmand and Raymond Carver would dare show up at a corner bar frequented by mostly guys, real guys, not Altman/Carver wimps and losers. I think they might seriously be razzed by an angry mob in such a situation and should best stay clear. However, perhaps positive reinforcement for their artist endeavors might come from Women's Lib soirees and liberal cocktail gatherings where such negative opinions about men are probably offered quite often and agreed upon without debate. The collection of actors in SHORT CUTS is impressive and they do excellent work: Jack Lemmon, Tim Robbins, Andie MacDowell, Julianne Moore and Frances McDormand, among others. For that, I give it two stars. Otherwise, SHORT CUTS is a sickening, male-bashing session not worth wasting your time on, unless of course you are a female who thinks all men are.."

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Transcending Film,"One of the best documentaries I have ever experienced. I use the word ""experienced"" on purpose, as the movie goes beyond being mere ""entertainment"", it forces the viewer to become so involved in the story (or case) that you become a thinking, analyzing participant. Andrew Jarecki made an achingly beautiful film, and his care and commitment to present the most unbiased version of events is evident. The dvd comes with an extra disc, containing lots of additional footage, facts, information and updates. After watching all of it, accessing the DVD-ROM content AND after listening to the commentary track by Jarecki, you will hit the internet in search of even more information of this compelling case."

The girls were able to assist each other by using the ""tricks of the trade"" demonstrated in the DVD.  There were 4 teenagers who looked incredible at their Homecoming Dance and they were able to do it all themselves at a fraction of the cost of a professional. The Perfect Wedding series is a must have if you have teenage daughters.  "
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Outstanding In The Film Noir Genre!,"It's not usual, or everyday, that one roots for the bad guy. This film is different however. I don't think any other actor could have pulled this film off, other than Mel Gibson in the role of Porter. Come to think of it, this is the only Mel Gibson film I own. But it's a great one. Before I digress any further, I have to explain my opening remark. Porter (Mel Gibson) is not a good guy. However, he is in the company of characters that are even more rotten than he is. For instance, he is a criminal too: Let's not forget that. However, the old adage 'Honor among thieves' seems to be a motto that Porter lives by. Especially when it is his wife and friend who nearly kill him and take off with the 70 thousand dollars of his hard earned income: Earned by robbing other criminals no less. 70 thousand dollars does not seem like a lot considering what Porter is about to do. But we'll get back to that in a moment."
dvd,,2.0,Well that was tedious,"Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination."
dvd,11 of 12,5.0,"Evergreen, and classic","In 1989, a good friend told me this film was excellent. I don't know why, but it took me 17 years to act on his good advice. In a way, I'm glad. Back then I might have simply liked the film. I'm not sure I would have recognized it for the evergreen, fresh and relevant classic that it is. Now, after one viewing, I can and do."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Endearing Sequel ,"This is an impressive sequel and a very good looking follow-up to ANNE OF THE GREEN GABLES. It is great to see Megan Follows as Anne Shirley once again. Megan Follows is just perfect in this role. Anne Shirley is now a bit older, has become a teacher and is quite involved in a society away from her rural settings. This gradual progression of characters and story from this original is very welcome and enjoyable. It is very endearing in many ways as was the original"

dvd,,5.0,"An intelligent, moving epic","Today ""bigger"" often means ""louder and more stupid"" so it will be quite a surprise, particularly for younger viewers, to see an epic (which this film surely is) in which the characters and situations, stylised though they may be, start from a premise of subtlety and intelligence. The thoughtful, engaging commentary track tells us that the relationship at the heart of the story - between Gladys Aylward and General Lin Nan - was largely fabricated and that Ms. Aylward deeply disapproved of the filmakers' licence in extrapolating a love story from their friendship. And yet their mutual respect for one another in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness is one of the film's most moving ideas. "

I love Christmas music and of course Christmas movies, the best being Christmas Vacation with Elf coming in a close second. Tim Allen's Santa Clause movies are also pretty good as are the old classics. I was really hoping Christmas with the Kranks would be another great movie but it was pretty much a let down. It was kind of like a cheap rip off of Christmas vacation in a couple of ways. There are definitely better movies to buy."
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Great 80's gem with the 2 Coreys...,"I'm not saying this is the best of the Corey movies, but Dream A Little Dream is definitely a worthy watch and makes for a great addition to your DVD collection. It's presented to us almost like a dream, which can make it hard to follow with quick cuts, but as the movie gets going, you suddenly realize what's going on. Well, at least I did anyway. This is a movie that will make you smile for so many reasons - seeing the Coreys, the 80's clothes/hair/music which will take you back to those good ol' days, and the uplifting storyline. You can't go wrong for the price either. Any fan of the Coreys or the 80's will definitely enjoy this movie. It's good fun and I readily recommend this movie. It reminds us that sometimes a change in our perspective is good and when we see things in a different light than we're used to, the bigger picture becomes much clearer"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,"Well, I enjoyed it. =) ","I was sceptic as most before seeing this movie. Personally, I would have rather watched a funny flick. But once I saw the first monster it started rocking my socks. The plot line does stray away but yet not too far from the original computer game. I would say that this movie is ""based"" on the game doom but is not a reenactment. Most people are probably expecting the movie to rekindle old memories of the computer game. One part of the movie makes you think of the actually game. But overall as a heads up, you will be disappointed. As for me I loved this movie just because of the action and the fight scenes. It really thrilled me. If you really don't care to see a game based movie at least watch this one for it's sheer action. Also, it makes you kind of think...would you turn into a monster if you were in the movie? Would you kill innocent people that had been infected even if they could be saved? HAHAHA The movie makes you think about that and it's cool in that aspect! =P The extras on the DVD aren't half bad either if you get the two disc edition."

dvd,,5.0,Fun for the Family,"Is it a ""don't mess with ma nature"" warning to the geneticists or a light-hearted, good-natured buddy film? We'd say it's more of the latter. Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman ushers twins separated at birth -- the intellectual Julius (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the bombastic Vincent (Danny DeVito) -- through a number of bumbling, getting-to-know-you scenarios. Twin chemistry drew audiences to the theaters in droves back in 1988"

Miranda's life seems perfect until it all comes crashing down around her. Miranda is a criminal psychologist in a psychiatric ward at a penitentiary for women. All is fine in her life until she leaves work one night and has to make a detour due to road closure. When Miranda sees a girl standing in the middle of the road, she crashes her car but is unhurt and concerned about the girl. After rushing over to the girl and speaking to her, Miranda's whole life changes. She awakes to find out that she is being held in the same psych ward she works at accused of brutally murdering her husband. Miranda must now do everything possible to prove her innocence. She herself must try to keep her sanity while being heavily medicated while seeing ghosts and being visited by spirits. This movie is edge of your seat entertainment from the very beginning. An excellent, well written movie with great surprises and twists. For horror fans, thriller fans and suspense fans, this is a movie to own if you haven't seen it yet. Simply a great great movie!!"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Fascinating historical drama with top notch performances,"This is a fascinating historical drama about the extraordinary life of Hungary's greatest nobleman, Count Szechenyi. This was the most expensive Hungarian film ever made prior to ""Faithless"" (2005), and it really shows on the production; the sets are great and the rare cgi scenes are also very well done. While most people don't know much about Hungarian actors, outside of their native land, the ones cast in this film are all remarkably talented. Karoly Eperjes' leading performance is absolutely mesmerizing, he gets absorbed into his character so much. Even if you don't understand Hungarian and have to switch on the English subtitles, you will still enjoy his performance, which is so passionate. Eperjes is the Hungarian Garry Oldman, his performances are always fascinating to watch regardless of the subject matter. This is an outstanding film, well worth the 20 bucks.    "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,One to Wonder At,"Ghobadi's film reaches into the rawest combat wounds and is surley one of the most corageous pieces of film-making imaginable. The film opens and closes with a jump/flight over a vertiginous cliff. Premonition? The war tale somehow manages to be capitavating to look at as well, which given that the village, the dominant stage, is one half refugee, tent-city and the other armourey detritus, is an achievement. There is not an adult of reproductive age on deck. The Kurdish kids are lead by the charismatic and irrepressible, Satellite who wheels and deals the pickings from the peasant's mine fields in order to eek a precarious living on behalf of his charges. In the absence of the aforesaid parents, the kids are prematurely aged. It is  this cast of the maimed and wizened that forms a centrepiece of immense gravity in Ghobadi's tale. A brief scene of the blind orphan calling for his mother down the stack of used shells(that in 'normal' times would be a stack of winter wood) is a cinematic masterstroke. The key figures are archetypal.The Armless Boy who lives with the most horrendous premonitions; his sister who has been raped and later suicides after drowning the orphan child they have 'inherited'; and Satellite's dependance on his second-sighted rival, brother to the permanently damaged girl of his affections.  Ghobadi's tale avoids sentimentality with its pragmatic, grim humour. The village elders are impotent before the devastation and dependant on the adolescent, Satellite to drip feed misinformation from the TV's skewered nformation of events.The US 'copter leaflet drop, promising help that is about as lightweight as the paper its written on, is unlikely to relieve the tragedy at ground level, as the film's protaganists crutch off to the right in the closing image"

You will particularly enjoy this film if you like to watch Ballroom Dancing competitions on PBS or the program ""Dancing With The Stars"". I also recommend that you watch the original Japanese version of ""Shall We Dance"", which this movie is based on. Both films share similiarities, but it is interesting to watch both versions of ""Shall We Dance"" and make your own comparisons. My favorite of the two is the American version of ""Shall We Dance"", with Richard Gere.  He is a multi-talented actor with a touch of Fred Astaire. And he can really dance!"

dvd,3 of 3,5.0,unforgettable,"I have always been a fan of Joseph Gordon Leavitt, and this film set that in concrete forever. Escaping his Tommy Soloman role in 3rd Rock From The Sun, Joseph has created a character so vivid and real that it's scary. Every actor in this film has done a fine job in telling this very sad story about friendship, love, sex, hopes and dreams. A few of the scenes are absolutely heart breaking to watch. The sex and violence may be viewed by some to be excessive, but it's a necessary part of telling this story. At times painful and uncomfortable to watch, the film takes hold of you and before you know it you are swept up in this very touching diary of what happens to boys when they become men too early"

dvd,,5.0,Beautiful!,"This film is a real gem. The casting could not have been better. Jeremy Sumpter has a magical quality that makes Peter completely believeable. He is a cutie that grabs your heart with his  mischievous smile. Jason Issacs does double duty as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook and handles  both roles perfectly. This film will appeal to all ages and everyone will take something special away from it. The youngest will love it for the timeless story and lovely special effects, while older viewers will be touched by the poignancy and ultimate loneliness of the boy who will not grow up. I highly recommend this movie"

I thought I was too uncoordinated to get this down, but the left to right on this DVD is REALLY confusing. Once I get messed up, there's no getting it back.  I DO NOT recommend this for anyone who is just starting out.  It's not easy to pick up the flow.  He goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it, to telling you to mix them all together by name.  I'm sorry, but when I am learning a movement, I can't remember what to do after only being told once.  I am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than I am to the names of them! I'm just left frustrated and wondering which DVD I should start with instead"

This is the type of film that perhaps can no longer be made in the climate that we live in.  Susan Sarandon plays the part of Brooke's mother.  Keith Carradine is also along for the ride as a not-so-successful photographer.  I highly recommend this film to those who can appreciate the works of David Hamilton and Jock Sturges

dvd,14 of 15,4.0,Entertaining portrait of this tragic beat poet,"I think there are two types of successful documentaries.  Great films regardless of subject matter (ie: Ken Burns work, Woodstock, Errol Morris's films) and documentaries that exist because of their subject matter (most of Michael Moore's films, Supersize Me, almost every musician or film star doc). This second group does not necessarily need to be a work of art to be successful.  If you're a fan of the subject, you'll almost inevitably like the film."

If you have liked ""Speed"", you will probably like ""S.W.A.T"" too. The actions are great, and so is the photography. The director has used his imagination and with the camera he managed to get some excellent shots for the movie. However, I was little disappointed by the acting of Samuel L. Jackson, and Michelle Rodriguez (actually not expected anything from her, she has an emotionless face), but Colin Farrell, and Olivier Martinez looked great throughout the movie. "

We ended up watching it twice, one after the other and were amazed at how much more we saw the second time.  You won't go wrong with this one.  We really love seeing the literary classics done with this kind of quality"
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Great movie - lackluster DVD,"I'm writing this review for people who want to know how they could possibly get this fantastic movie for such a cheap price.  First, let me say that I love this movie.  I have owned it on VHS for years and have finally replaced it on DVD.  "
dvd,74 of 77,5.0,Erotic science fiction at its best,"In this erotic science fiction film from the folks at Surrender Cinema, fan favorite Jacqueline Lovell plays Lolida, a former employee of an organization dedicated to finding and destroying anything possessing the least bit of sexual content.  Now, she is on the run from her former employers, carrying with her a number of video ""stories"" that touched her (and caused her to touch herself) and made her realize that the very knowledge she was destroying should actually be spread far and wide.  To that effect, she produces three of these stories for the benefit of whoever may be receiving her transmission.  The three individual stories are quite strange, involving alien abduction, a female pilot's imprisonment on a distant planet, and a man caught in a ""time slip.""  Featuring a significant number of impressive softcore scenes, these three stories manage to be interesting as well as provocative.  It is unfortunate that Jacqueline Lovell serves as little more than lovely narrator herein, but some scintillating performances from the likes of Gabriella Hall do much to assuage one's disappointment.  Lolida 2000 is yet further proof that Surrender Cinema makes the best erotic movies in the business"

dvd,0 of 3,5.0,A must for the home collection,"I'm trying to decide which of the three I love the best, but all should be part of one's home library. I often view them while I'm on my exercise bike and always pedal faster! It's easy to forget you're sweating while watching people on the screen being chased by dinosaurs. Perhaps gyms across the country should invest in the Jurassic Park movie collection?"
dvd,3 of 7,1.0,I wasted over 3 bucks and an hour and half of my life for this film!,"The other reviews tell you the plot (if you can call it that). The first scene actually had me intriqued and I thought it was going to be a good flick! Then, things went to hell. I just want to say that this movie is horrible! I LOVE JLH, so I was very surprised to see her in such a bad movie. The writing, directing, and everything in this movie was blatently bad. "
dvd,,5.0,John Ford/Henry Fonda/John Wayne Craft Excellent Western,"The 1st and best of the calvary trilogy.  Fonda plays a small-minded, embittered, rascist, classist, dishonorable, incompentent, pendantic, martinet.  Wayne, in a subordinant role, plays his loyal but wary second-in-command. From the very beginning, Ford's Col Thursday gets off on the wrong foot.  Rude, unprofessional and openly disdainful, he alienates everyone on his new post, especially and, purhaps most importantly, the women. His ceaseless disrespect offends the wives and infuriates their husbands. Nobody likes to see their wife disrespected, particularly by a senior officer who should know better. Fort Apache is a wonderful examination of military mens' devotion to duty even when commanded by those unfit to command"
dvd,,5.0,"""Look, it's okay to admire my wife, but would you mind taking your elbow out of my butter?""","Here's the plot: Before they were partners, Bert Kalmar (Fred Astaire) was one half of the popular dance act Kalmar & Brown, and Harry Ruby (Red Skelton) was a struggling piano player/songplugger. The first time Kalmar and Ruby met, it doesn't turn out well. Kalmar, you see, is obsessed with magic and moonlights as a stage magician. When Ruby is assigned as his assistant, he botches Kalmar's magic act disastrously and earns Kalmar's wrath. However, when Kalmar suffers a back stage knee accident and has to break up his dance team, he bumps into Ruby again. This time, they manage to collaborate on a song before things go south, and that, in essence, was the birth of their successful tin pan alley songwriting partnership. "
dvd,9 of 9,4.0,"A well written, well filmed and well acted adaptation. Highly Recommend","For anyone who has seen the 1981 film adaptation by Just Jaeckin and was dissapointed then this is for you. The 1981 film, I feel, failed to capture the essence of Lady Chatterley's character whilst this version has got it almost perfect. I think the filming and editing in this version far exceeds the film and the acting is a darn sight better. Joely Richardson does the lead justice and Sean Bean (although much better looking that the book describes Mellors but really, who's complaining?) compliments her well. The screen play is faithful considering filming constraints and all together I really enjoyed it. I'm now studying the novel for a university module and this has made me appreciate what is essentially a book/adaptation that pushes class boundaries through the guise of female sexuality. It caused a lot of controversy because of the female lead apparantly being stronger than her husband, taken to extreme in her sexual escapades, rather than being simply an object owned my him. At the trial of the book in the late 1920s the procecutor famously opened with the statement ""Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?"" Need he say more?"

dvd,1 of 3,4.0,"Martian western with Cheese, please.","This film has a few rough spots( Carpenter lacks the chops of a major action director and his fight sequences fall a bit flat) but all in all i would say this is an enjoyable bit of b-movie hokum. I loved the setting and thought ICE CUBE and his gang of Compadres were the coolest Carpenter anti-heroes since Snake Plissken.And once again Carpenter has come up with a compelling blending of genres; this thing plays like a western, a zombie film, a demonic possession thriller, a kung-fu fight fest and an urban siege film (one can clearly see the influence of both the western RIO BRAVO and Carpenter's own ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 here)."
dvd,,5.0,Stephen King is awesome!  Tak a Lak,"I read the book before I Purchased the Movie, which is always better, but the movie folows the book very closely from beginning to end. 2 people driving in a desert stopped by a demented cop, who plants drugs on them.They are taken to a jailhouse where others that were abducted are kept, and the story builds from there. Don't want to give away to much, but if you are an avid Stephen king fan, you will not be disapointed."

dvd,,4.0,Digital Photography Unleashed: Very Good ,This is an excellent introduction to photography (Film or Digital). It was a little basic for me but on the other hand it was good to do the review of basics.  I gained alot from the instructions on techniques. I recommend it for anyone except the very advanced photographer
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,It would be five stars if.....,"In fact, I'd like to rate it as 4 and a half stars for this DVDs set. The reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me is because the game 7 (1988 semi-final) I got was not really completely, it didn't included the first minute of the game, and in the end of the game, it also missed about 10 seconds. However, it didn't really missed the famous duel between Bird and Wilkins. But still, it would be really nice if I can get a ""completely"" game. And from some of the previous reviews, it looks like I was just unlucky to get the incomplete one (or the faulty one)."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,I still love Lucy,"It's amazing how fresh and funny this series still seems after more than fifty years and I don't know how many viewings.  My two younger sons, aged eight and five, watch it with me and are as enraptured as I am.   Lucille Ball herself is dazzling, but Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley all give wonderful and hilarious performances too.  What a marvellous team they made."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Ground Zero Heroes - up close and personal,"Like Day of Disaster, Steve Spak has filmed close up footage of emergency workers, this time during the recovery phase, that most similar programs do not have. Steve's access to emergency workers allows for a perspective that most other documentaries have not shown. It shows action and emotion that have been excluded in similar works. If the viewer wants to feel what really took place in the pit, this is the one to watch."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,The Western's last dying gasp...,"Sam Peckinpah defines the word ""maverick."" He came out of Hollywood with his own unique brand of filmmaking that often clashed with studio executives. This resulted in a career of tough, uncompromising movies that were either loved or hated - there was no in-between with Peckinpah's movies. This collection feature some of the man's most memorable westerns and if there is a theme that unites them all it is the continuing pre-occupation with over-the-hill professionals existing in a world that they no longer belong in and are given one last shot at glory and redemption."
dvd,15 of 18,4.0,Not to be missed.,"This movie is based on a true story of Paul Castellano, who ruled the Manhattan in 1970s with construction unions and real estates funded by the money he earned from the illegal activities of the Gambino crime family. After becoming the head of the crime family, his resistance to involve in drugs and crimes made many people down the chain unhappy. John Gotti was one of them, who later assassinate Castellano and rose to power. "

Makes me laugh every time my son attempt to dance with them.  He's 10 months old and is a serious fan of the dancing, color, and music.  I believe the older he gets it will definitely help him with his imagination, and teach him to play and share with others.  I'm especially happy with the fact that more than 1 episode is included on each DVD.  Can't wait for the new releases to come out.  If you haven't seen their show, tune in to Nick Jr. and you'll be impressed like I am"
dvd,10 of 10,5.0,"Star-studded cast, impeccable acting and great drama as well as comedy.  As fresh today as it was in 1933. ","My mother used to use the expression ""dinner at eight"" to refer to the high-drama that always precedes the launching of a party.  She must have seen this 1933 film and it obviously influenced her for her entire life.  It wasn't until last night, however, that I, myself, saw this film on DVD.  And I must say that I can now well understand the effect it had on my mother and on her generation.  "
dvd,0 of 2,1.0,a little harsh the first time,"I posted this originally under ""wow...this sucks""...I may have been a little harsh.  I am still disappointed with it, as I had high hopes when I caught the tail end of the performance on TV (but I think I saw his first ""Bananas"").  Its not that there are no funny parts (there are a few), but its that his material is not really fresh and original...its been done before and done better(particularly arguing with his puppets and some of his general observations that start the show and I really didn't care for his timing/delivery).  I will say that his puppet symphony at the end is a killer segment...I did laugh really hard at that...i guess if i could change my rating it would be a 2 out of 5 instead of 1.  Check out the Jeff Allen ""Bananas"" DVD...he is funny, orginal, and the story of his life will bless anyone who watches it.  "
dvd,2 of 2,2.0,WOW,"Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an ""accidental death"" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"Good Holiday fun, but re-releases","This is a great way to get a the Disney shorts for the Holidays, but you may be buying the stories multiple times.  Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol are also on the DVD Snowed in at the House of Mouse.  I prefer House of Mouse even with the extra narration tying in the cartoons because it also has one of the Donald on Ice cartoons.  Small one is nice, but sad and is also on included on another DVD as a special feature.  Disney is releasing their cartoons on multiple DVDs at the same time and it is easy to buy short DVDs like this one and find out later that all the cartoons are already on a larger compilation.  As an earlier review said, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is already on 2 other DVDs.  Still, if you want a particular cartoon and not all of them, this is a good way to go"
dvd,,4.0,Politics and Injustice,"This movie is the quintessential example of how politics and public opinion rules the day.  Each of the actors in this criminal injustice movie are compelling.  Cusack's plight is what endears him to the viewer--restive in nature, the Louisiana boy attempts to save Pacino's administration and future but, is unable to resurrect him in the end. While Pacino is resolute in his hopes, dreams and desires, his role as the Greek mayor of New York City is plagued with a plethora of problems that he can no longer control.  His prior associations for good or bad is what is his final Waterloo.  This film is resplendent in its depiction of police and political depravity.  This is a must see film for political science and criminal justice students."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,The great underrated 60's classic,"PETULIA is one of my all time favorites. Incredibly beautiful, haunting, humorous and, finally, heartbreaking mosaic story of people at a time of seismic cultural shifts in america.  One of the last adult relationship dramas made by Hollywood. Influenced by all that was happening in European and american film at the time , stylistically, it is a breathtaking feast of filmmaking. I saw it in college, in Dayton, Ohio, and I've never forgotten it. I've seen it, maybe 20 times, and have introduced it to many, many friends.  I met the producer, Raymond Wagner, twice at PETULIA screenings at the L.A. County Museum and at the American Cinematheque, and he said that George C. Scott regarded his performanced in it as his personal favorite. Why does this film touch people in such a unique way?  I've tracked down most of the locations in San francisco when i used to live there.  Dr. Bolen's modern apartment location is still there on the Filbert steps beneath Coit Tower"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"No words, just unintelligible drooling.","Oh my. This is a brilliant DVD. First of all, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that the Beasties make some seriously awesome music videos. Case in point: my brothers are not B-boy fans, but they worship at the altar of Sabotage every time it plays. So compiling the videos (minus those during the Def Jam days) by itself is a fantastic idea. Then, there's the countless different camera angles, often several per video. The stills. The commentaries from directors and the Boys themselves. (Even though theirs don't bring much new knowledge to light. Whatever, even as kickback as their commentary is, it works.) The different remixes. Again, often several per song. The extra clips like the interview with the cast of Sabotage (my sides hurt after that one) and the Intergalactic short. This DVD is so jammed with goodies that you won't want to leave your house. Ever. Okay, for at least a very long time. Bonus points for making everything clear and concise, the instruction manual, and the kick ass Sabotage poster that now resides on my ceiling"
dvd,3 of 6,5.0,Much More Than Just Really Hot Chicks Naked,"There are so many reasons to like ""Wild Things"" it's easy to call this movie perfect. Although it's not the best movie ever made (or even in the Top 20 for that matter) it truly is a perfect movie...For what it could've been. I borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it, it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity. Well, this movie does have a plot and it's quite complicated. Some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes, but you can't argue that this is a damned good movie. Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School. Lombardo is a lady's man, in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he's done half of Blue Bay. Well, Lombardo has a student named Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards, who i've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie) who seems to be coming onto him; Lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother Sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in Blue Bay. Well, one day Kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash Lombardo's car for the senior car wash and then we see Kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face. Then, Kelly says Lombardo raped her. Lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer (Bill Murray). Well, then another girl named Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) says Lombardo raped her as well. Another player in the plot is Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon), the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories. Now, this movie is one of those films where you think you know what's going on and then they throw a wild card. After that, you think you know what's going on again and then s*it happens. Even when the movie ends, you don't know the full story until the credit sequence. The sex scenes (the most famous with Denise Richards, Matt Dillon, and Neve Campebell) are quite nice, but surprisingly the movie would be good without them. This is a really great movie and worth the $5 bucks it would cost to buy it. "
dvd,5 of 33,1.0,"fake ""Dog Whisperer"" - studious ignorance","Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it. "
dvd,6 of 22,1.0,This Film is an Outrageous Sacrilege!!!!!!!," Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don't misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things."
dvd,12 of 13,5.0,Wonderful find for exercise after my baby!!,"I recently had a baby boy, and felt a &quot;little&quot; out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB"
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Just amazing...,"I was born in '73, didn't even exist when this was shot, but caught it on cable and was just blown away.  As a fan of Janis, the Dead, Buddy Guy (he's still doing his thing here in Chicago), and most of all The Band, it is simply amazing to see these folks in their prime.  Best part, hands down is to see these amazingly talented musicians all jamming together between shows on the train, wasted out of their minds.  Truly enjoyable"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Highly recommend for a great overall workout!,"I have several of Karen Voight's workouts, and as usual, she attacks her excercises with fury! But, she's encouraging enough to keep you going. And seeing what great shape she's in really motivates! This interval workout is the perfect balance of toning and cardio. Challenging enough to work up a good sweat, but not too intense... just right! Everytime I do this, I feel exhilerated and proud! For great overall workout, Karen Voight is a must-have"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Definitely an overlooked movie...,"This movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise, but it took a few watches for me to get to feel that way. Gene Hackman plays a private eye who is under utilized in his career (he plays an ex-Oakland Raider in the movie) and is also in the middle of discovering that his marriage is falling apart. (I thought it was interesting how Hackman used his private eye skills to spy on his wife while she was cheating on him.) Hackman's character accepts a seemingly open and shut runaway case (to bring home Melanie Griffith's character) that is nowhere near as simple as it seems. The plot line takes so many twists and turns it does get confusing, but it never gets boring. Overall, I thought Gene Hackman did a great job in this movie, and there were also good performances from the supporting cast. It was fun to see Melanie Griffith and James Woods so early in their careers too. The DVD was worth buying and also has footage on the making of the film"
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Ice Princess - follow your dream,"The movie has a good moral - always follow your dream, not somebody's else. Good story. Very serious, but sometimes funny. Nice ice skating scenes. Suitable for children. Good for a group movie."

dvd,9 of 11,5.0,Bat-21,This film encompases the realism a Vietnam Veteran wants in a film centered on/in that war.  the films actors dedication to self portrayals of those who were there while fighting against all odds for those in need and under fire is accurate.  Danny Glover portrays the honest truth of character that most men had within themselves while there.  I remembered my own dedication to my country and its best beliefs while watching the film.  Thank you Danny for a wonderful portrayal
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,"Book was better, but I did love this too :-)","I really love this movie.  I go back to it every now and then.  I love the music and the scenery and the entire storyline and everything about it.  Some of it is humourous, same is a little sad, but the whole thing is excellent.  It gets you at the start and keeps you engrossed.  Angela Basset is one of the best actress' out there at the best of times, but in this she is fantastic.  I love her throwing all of her husbands clothes etc into the car and setting it alight.  That is such excellent revenge.  I also loved Loretta Devine here.  Her character gets involved with the late great Gregory Hines who is amazing and she plays her part well.  There is a good 'cameo' spot by Wesley Snipes (yum) and even Whitney Houston didn't do a bad job.  Look, it never was going to be nominated for an Oscar, but it's still a great girl movie and thoroughly fun.  I love it.  Check out the soundtrack too.  It's tight"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,YOU MUST HAVE!!...Great Video!!!!!!!!,"I Bought this dvd hoping to learn or to get some movements of break dancing, and I learned more than expected."
dvd,15 of 17,1.0,The Longest 108 Minutes,"I have nothing against soft core movies and every now and then I see one that actually has a decent story.  Unfortunately, Poison Ivy II is not one of those movies.  The story drags so badly that you'd swear it's stretched over at least 4 hours  and it generally feels as slow and constipated as any film you're ever likely to suffer through.  If there was some geunuine heat on the screen when the movie tries to be sexy, you might forgive this.  Alas, the sex is just as ponderous and devoid of appeal as the rest of Poison Ivy II.  Alyssa Milano looks like she wants to be somewhere else every time she reveals even a little bit of skin and there is never a sense of true passion when she's with either her boyfriend or her art teacher."

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,The January Man,"Though I bought the movie because I'm a HUGE Alan Rickman fan, I found the movie thoroughly enjoyable. Kevin Kine of course is wonderful, and very amusing.

dvd,7 of 16,4.0,Another widescreen review,"PICTURE QUALITY = 4-SOUND QUALITY = 5+The overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying. Color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie. Improves as movie goes on. This being a very senic movie I was not completly happy but still satisfied. Could've been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but wasnt.The sound quality in Dolby was awesome. Not in Dolby Digital but on a system with Pro Logic II it souded great if not better than most non-digital dolby surround. All surround sounds are present and really stood out. The soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room. Very happpy with this DVD sound quality.THE MOVIE - *note spolier. The movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a FUN Western movie. Comedy, action, stunts, scenery, and many great actors. Everything you would want in a &quot;fun&quot; western film in the old fashioned tradition. Light on violence and good enough for the whole family.*Spoiler - The best (and my favorite) thing about this movie is the fact that James Garner still plays as Maverick even though the audience doesn't know it. Watching it over and knowing that Mel Gibson is playing his role as &quot;the son of Maverick&quot; and James Garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and over.My overall review is that it is worth buying and I'd give it 5 stars if the picture was just a touch better. Don't be fooled though, I have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component DVD player so I see almost any grain there is if any is present. Overall this DVD was satisfying enough to make me happy I bought it. On any other tv it will display a perfect picture.

dvd,,5.0,An Oldie but a Goodie,"This party pack should be a no brainer purschase for anybody fond of the 60's/70's stoner party era.  ""Dazed and Confused"" is a movie which portrays a typical high school where the new seniors are eagar to start hazing the new freshman, a regular ritual preformed at the school.  For the boys its a few paddlings to the butt with a wooden paddle that all the seniors make and take pride and creativity in making.  For the girls it's less painful with only the freshman cheerleaders getting soaked in miscellaneous items such as raw eggs, ketchup, mustard, etc.  The movie focuses heavily on one boy that breaks his way in to the senior group and ends up hanging out with them regularly including attending parties with them, hanging out at the pool hall, and even smoking weed with the guys.  In the end it just shows a typical party night for that high school.  All in all the movie is wonderfully done with accurate cars of the time and usual night activities (going to the drive-in diners and hanging out at the pool hall).  The actors in the movie were excellent and some sparking the beginning to their very successful career with this movie.  A must see!  As for ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" this movie is similiar to ""Dazed and Confused"".  It has similiar qualities Dazed in that all the kids in the movie are all about partying and having a good time.  The main character of the movie, Jeff Spicoli, is a huge stoner that shows up to class late aggravating one teacher in particular, Mr. Hand the teacher that thinks everybody on dope, who ends up getting his ""stole time"" back from Jeff in the end.  The movie also focuses on Mark Ratner and Damone, the man who helps Mark with his love life and ends up eventually steal Mark's dream girl away from her and getting her pregnant, something he pays for in the end.  The movie is very good and shows high school life in a slightly dramatized comical way, a great movie for anybody who likes ""Dazed..."".  "
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,A classic  Treasure,"This is one of the very few movies ever made that I could watch over and over again. I do regard this movie as a classic by which today's movies can't really compare to. The acting is great , the dancing amazing, there are  some tunes that will stick in you head for quite a while; What's not to like?  If you like musicals, this is one you should see"

dvd,1 of 9,4.0,Realistic depiction of war with some cheesy exhibition of patriotism,MY MOVIE REVIEW RUBRIC (03/19/06 VERSION):
dvd,7 of 7,5.0,Absolutely Brilliant,"I started watching this show as reruns in '96 on Comedy Central and could not believe I was actually seeing the results of rare comedic geniuses.   Not many things crack me up anymore, but I was hooked after seeing this.  It even inspired me to visit London for the first time.   This is one of those rare syzygical moments in comedy that will always be remembered.   A must have unless you're an uptight conservative snob!   Get 4 DVD set only.  The newer DVD set is funny, but the magic is hardly there any more.  "
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,My favorite version!,"If I had to pronounce myself by the two best achievements of the Goddess Garbo I should mention Flesh and the devil and this one. In both cases the director was Clarence Brown who knew to impress it to Garbo this sense of  vertigo and misconduct, that is hard to find in any other version. "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,"The real ""melting pot""","I watched L'Auberge Espagnole on a flight home from the east coast, and literally laughed outloud at some scenes. No, it's definitely not an Audrey Tautou movie (though she plays a small supporting role). But it is a wonderful movie about that transition in life -- when we finally realize who we are and what we want. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,My daughter drives me nuts with this show,"Since my daughter (3 yrs old) first started watching it on HBO, she fell in LOVE with Harold and the Purple Crayon. When I purchased the DVD she constantly wants to play it over and over and over. She brings the DVD along wherever she goes. It's the perfect cartoon for children in her age group. "
dvd,1 of 21,2.0,boring,didn't get into it; nothing engaging here; movie didn't make me interested at all; characters boring; turned it off after 30 minute
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Must-Have!,"My son, who is almost 3, wanted to watch only this DVD for about 2 weeks when I bought it. Inertaining and educational! The first day he already new all the planes, trains and automobiles! And he loves to sing along to the ""school bus"" song! I owen all of the Baby Einstein Videos, and now the ""Little Einsteins"", and I think they are great! Nice, peaceful music, and very educational! My son has been watching these shows since he was about 3 monts, and still enjoys them! I recomend them to Everyone"
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,"film noir classic collection, vol 2",My husband and I enjoyed all of these movies.
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,An Amazing Film,"I'll keep this brief. Trying to think of a director living and working today who would make a film this brave is impossible. It's unfathomable. This is a film that stands among the very best of the last, great gasp of American film making in the late seventies. If you have an aversion towards ""musicals"", (which I do) leave your aversions aside and view one of the greatest autobigraphical films ever made. It's self depreciating nature is way beyond words. It's triumphant in it's self exploration, perhaps more so than any other film I've seen. What a movie. Do yourself a favor"
dvd,14 of 14,4.0,"""This Dirty Little Hole Is My Dreaming""  ~  Getting Caught In The Middle","Ray (Bryan Brown), the resident white police officier in a remote region of the Australian Outback finds himself in over his head when a young male is murdered for descrating a local sacred site. Ray's attempts to locate the killer are hampered by the local aborginal community which views the death as required and justifiable by ancient tribal law. And so the confrontation begins."
dvd,,5.0,Great DVD for kids too!!!,I love this series! I think I'm a bigger fan of it than my 6yr old son.
dvd,,4.0,"Some Glitches, But  Still Pretty Good. ","I know some previous reviewers pointed out some glitches to this 9th chapter. (1. We don't know how Jason came back after the end of Part 8. 2. Jason has a sister in this movie even though in Part 1 his mother said he was an only child. 3. Jason supposedly can only be killed by a certain party, even though we know Tommy Jarvis killed Jason in Part 4.) Well, if you raised these complaints, you were right. But the truth is, if people are willing to pay to see sequels, the industry will do what it has to do to create another chapter, and it really doesn't care about cheating. (Look how ""Halloween 4"" brought back Michael and Dr. Loomis even though they should have died in a hospital fire. But they cheated because people wanted another chapter.) Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I think Part 1 was pretty good; part 2 had it's moments; I didn't much care for Part 3; part 4 had its good points and introduced Tommy Jarvis; part 5 was surprisingly good and focused on the aftermath of survivor Tommy Jarvis; part 6 remains my favorite one for soundtrack, well done scenes, and a surprisingly well written script; part 7 was arguably the most boring and worst chapter; part 8 was slightly better than part 7. Onto the subject at hand. The opening scene gives us something new. We see Jason blown to bits, and we are wondering how even Jason will come back from this. (But since this is the 1st scene we obviously know he will do it somehow.) Good suspense. Soon we learn that Jason has the ability to inhabit other bodies when he (with some nice effects and musical touches) 'borrows' the coroner's body. Jason then continues his killing spree. As Jason does this, we learn that Jason has a surviving sister, niece, and once removed niece. Also, we meet Mr. Duke. Duke explains that Jason has the ability to jump into other bodies, that he knows the way to destroy Jason, and will do so for a price. One interesting thing is that we learn that Jason can't stay in any one body long before he must seek a new one. We are allowed some time to wonder why before Duke gives us the answer. Besides telling us the way Jason can be destroyed, Duke also explains to us that Jason will eventually need to make use of some Voorhees woman to get his own body back. Now I know some people complained that we don't get to see Jason on screen too much, but let's be fair. We all know (possibly through the good acting of the borrowed bodies) who Jason is. 2nd, it offers some new twist in that the other characters don't know at first who Jason is, and in one well drawn scene even we the audience don't know. 3rd, rather than just wondering how many people will get killed before (providing if) Jason is stopped, we are in suspense as to whether Jason will somehow manage to get his own body back. Overall, there is good suspense, some good laughs, decent character development, some new twists, and action that is not so overdone. While Part 6 will always be the best to me, this chapter was surprisingly good.   "
dvd,22 of 25,5.0,Super cool movie the same as before,"Another re-release for ""Ice Age"" (this is the third counting the single disc edition of the film) to coincide with the sequel, this edition essentially is the previous two disc edition with some minor features added that don't make it any more worthwhile to pick up. The DVD ROM printables and ""Scrat's Frozen Facts"" appear to be the newest features on this set. Most of the featurettes are recycled from the previous edition."
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,GREAT!!!!...,"I've been attracted to the smiling pirate image (he is smiling?) of the Silver & Black ever since I was a little kid. I love EVERYTHING here: *especially* the '70s, '80s & L.A Raiders..."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,THE BEST EVER,THIS WAS VERY FUNNY AND BROUGHT BACK THE GOOD OLE DAYS.  VERY ENJOYABLE!!!!
dvd,,5.0,I love this movie.,"This movie came out when I was twelve and I have been in love with it ever since. It brought me, a rural farm kid, the magic of Leonard Cohen, Concrete Blond, Was (Not Was),The Beastie Boys, and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film. It also brought me Christian Slater in a role that I would later relate to in a big way as a teen. In short, for reasons all sentimental, I love this film. It may not have cohesiveness in the same way ""Heathers"" does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days. So watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school. I know I do"
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,Batman AND moviegoers finally get the film they deserve..,"I can't add much more to what everyone else has already said except to say that I totally love this film, and it is  one of the best comic/superhero films of all time, much less the BEST silver-screen representation of Batman. None of the other films can even touch this one. "
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,Think! Think! Think!,"Someone said vol.3 is little bit boring than last two sets. Yes, episode 9-12 doesn't contain many actions as other stories. However, without watching through episode 9 & 11, it will be a bit difficult to understand why the Laughing Man did kidnapping 6 years ago. (Episode 9 does tell not only who the Laughing Man is, but also the background of financial & political situation around that time...Well, still, episode 9 is a summery of the incidents.) If you notice that one of the kids appiered in episode 11 is one of the chat member, you might understand why I said so. "
dvd,2 of 6,2.0,Sound is So Bad Almost Inaudible!," Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion"
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Milford Hi ,"Stephen King's: Sometimes They Come Back is very emotional, yet funny at the same time.  Given, the movie doesn't come near the quality of the short story.  However, it definitely puts SK's story to life.  The acting is very good.  In fact, for SK's Constant Readers, this appears a good deal in other of his novels & stories.  Hearts in Atlantis for one.  * That train that appears a # of times in the movie, I wonder if that is: Charlie The Choo-Choo from The Dark Tower saga"
dvd,2 of 6,5.0,Sophie's Choice,"For the first time, director Pakula exposed the breadth of Streep's prodigious talent when he cast her as Sophie. ""Choice"" is deliberately paced, literate, and atmospheric, and be warned - does include some disturbing flashback sequences. Above all, it's a Streep tour-de-force, netting her a well-deserved Oscar. Kline is also solid as the tragic Nathan. This devastating film will stay with you long after the lights come up."
dvd,1 of 2,5.0,What is the 6th Sense?,"Is it the ability to see dead people?  Yes, in a sense.  But in a broader sense, it is the ability to see the invisible, non-sensory forces that motivate people's behaviors.  In the movie, the sense is manifested in a child's ability to see ""ghosts,"" the ability to see undead people whose souls are not at rest, still troubled by what they perceive are mistakes in their past.  Many children and adults are gifted with the ability to ""see"" what other people cannot see, the ability to see what is read between the lines of the 5 normal senses.  "
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,  Please! It's Entertainment Not Reality!,"  There's only one reason to see this movie. Entertainment.  It's just that simple.  If you're looking for profound, this whole movie genre isn't it.  If your looking for fast paced action, witty dialogue, an edgy sound track that compliments the plot... a wild, unique approach to stunts, and a totally unconventional, irreverent ""secret agent""... then this movie is for you.   "
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,BEWARE!!!!!!  NEW AMAZON shipping box exposes the invoice and contents!,"I gave the item five stars (although I haven't viewed it--it is a gift), but this review is about NEW unacceptable Amazon packaging for this item. I ordered this item as a Christmas gift. I received it in a brown box with a shipping label.  When the box was turned over, there was a peek-a-boo hole in the box approiximately  2.5"" x 3.5"" exposing the invoice.  The order number, content information and price were ALL visible through the hole. If you are concerned about privacy or if you are buying this as a gift and wish to keep the contents secret from another household member, you may want to purchase this item elsewhere or make plans to be the only one picking up the mail until after it arrives. I have purchased MANY things from Amazon and this is the first time I have received anything in this type of box. I hope it will be the last.  "
dvd,4 of 6,4.0,A more refined Sept. Sessions,"It's the natural progression from September Sessions and it hits the mark.  With amazing footage and an equally fantastic score this is the quintesintial chillax surf film.  There are several shots where the film runs right to the end, bleeding out perfectly on a ride or a gnarly wipeout.  It's perfect and in the end leaves you begging for more, and for a board and some surf.  I'd really give it a 5 but I don't want to be waxin' any balls here"
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,a classic story that's worth your attention,"As much as I adored the original version of this film with Albert Finney and Aileen Quinn, I am not the type of person who instantly shuns remakes. I love the story of ""Annie"" and was very excited to see a new version when this first came out in 1999."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,Great movie,great movie the only thing is that it don't have subtitle in Spanish
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Sometimes Life Gets in the Way of Our Humanity,This movie has an excellent moral that can really change your life if you will apply it to yourself. 
dvd,,5.0,Columbo meets The Prisoner,"I would like to point out just one interesting episode of this somewhat famished collection of Columbo edibles. Patrick McGoohan, who gained fame with his portrayal of Spies and what happens to spies when they retire, gets to hint at his Prisoner role a bit in a great issue of Columbo from this particular year. Identity Crisis is what the audience experiences, as little hints are constantly betraying the murderer and his identity as the prisoner. McGoohan says more than once ""Be seeing you"". This of course, was the departing custom by Number 6. He is also well acquainted with Japanese and the east and it is perhaps one of the better Columbo episodes. As fans know McGoohan appeared twice during the run of this series and as a bit of trivia, only 2 actors appeared 3 times as Columbo criminals. Robert Culp and Jack Cassidy. (Cassidys on this season too!)  In reviewing the rest, the scenarios are always the same. Rich people commit murder, Columbo visits and hounds them constantly while he discovers inconsistencies in their alibi and eventually tracks down minute'mistakes to eventually convict the person, as they smugly assist in their own downfall with superior attitudes and constant counter suggestions meant to take Columbo off the scent. Worked every time"
dvd,7 of 9,5.0,Why can't more movies have this depth?,"I can't say enough good things about this independent movie!  It is a well-made movie that kept me hanging on to the edge of my seat to the last minute.  The ending had me thinking about the movie days later.  It really made me re-evaluate my own life: my struggles with food addiction, etc.  It's so hard to change destructive habits, especially with all the temptations in our world. It answers the question, ""How does one change or what has to happen for one who has no control to find control?""  Never before have I seen such realism in depicting the devastation of heroin addiction.  This gritty, labor of love is not to be missed.  It really puts to shame a lot of the multi-million-dollar T&A mainstream movies that have neither soul nor message.  I realize even more the need to support independent movies, so they'll continue to be made.  They dare to take us where mainstream won't.      "
dvd,,5.0,Worth Every Penny!,"I love David Talbert's work.  These plays are worth every penny!  I originally rented He Say She Say ...., I loved it so much that I decided to buy the three pack.  I have watched these movies soooooooo many times!  They are great for family gatherings as well.  Instead of watching movies that everyone has seen, I pull this out of the collection and we have a blast!  For many of my relatives, this was there first time hearing about these plays."
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,"Nothing like the book, but still good.","It's nothing like the book, but I still liked it. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think the acting was great and it wasn't nearly as great as the first movie in the series. Nor was it as good as the book. But I'm still glad we bought it. It's a fun movie  but it will never make my favorites list. "
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,I could watch Vitti read the phone book (and I'm surprised she never gets around to that in this beautiful neo-realist classic),"This is the first movie I've Netflixed twice.  I kept it for two months the first time, watched almost all of it, but then lost patience and sent it back because there was something else I wanted to get quickly.  But I couldn't stop thinking back about it and wound up renting it again.  I'm considering just going ahead and buying it.  I still haven't figured out if I actually *like* it or not.  But I can't stop watching it.  "
dvd,4 of 5,2.0,Not that good,"David Kirsch needs to stop touting his own horn- his little  ""distinctively david"" tips are annoying (because he is not the first person to come up with the workouts he teaches) and WE KNOW he works with stars like heidi klum- give it a rest already."
dvd,,5.0,Barbara Cook and Sondheim at their best,"For those that love Barbara Cook's splendid vocal ability, and the music of Sondhim, this is a real treat.  This is as close as one can get without being at a live concert"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,"Beautiful film, even if the message is obvious.","Despite the fact that I think it's ridiculous to structure a film around the question of whether non-human beings experience emotions (only a species as arrogant and detached from nature as ours could even conceive of such a question), this film was extremely worthwhile.  There were some interesting points, for instance: human anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications probably work on dogs because their brains are reasonably similar to ours; and fear is probably ""the"" universal emotion because it leads to survival-enhancing behavior.  The footage on octopi, dogs, sea lions, rhesus monkeys, dolphins, elephants, and wolves, among other species, was beautiful to watch and often incredibly moving.  While I'm glad that there is now a body of scientific work on this subject, many of us don't need science to understand that many species experience emotions as we do.  Konrad Lorenz, though he was a fine scientist, was probably not relying on research when he said: ""The fidelity of a dog is a precious gift demanding no less binding moral responsibilities than the friendship of a human being.  The bond with a true dog is as lasting as the ties of this earth can ever be."
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,CHAPLIN SPOOFS HITLER!," The great Charlie Chaplin was a ""pre-mature anti-fascist'.These leftist political leanings and a  private life that was ""uncoventional "" eventuallu led Chaplin to leave the U.S(he also had tax problens) for Europe,but years before leaving,he starred,directed and wrote this masterful satire/spoof/put-down of Adolph Hiter.I won't repeat what the other reviewers have written,but I will say it NEVER fails that tears come to my eyes every time I see/hear Chaplins closing speech."
dvd,,5.0,Kids will love it--through 2nd grade,"My kids began doing yoga in PE class at school this past year--about the same time I began doing yoga. Many yoga DVDs are just above kid level (ability and interest-wise) unless the child has been doing yoga for awhile. I can see kids loving this--the breaks are humorous and allow kids a breather. It's a fun way to get children to exercise and to learn yoga poses. Of course they will move past this level in time, but it's a nice way to maintain their interest. I can see kids up through 2nd grade (and even into 3rd) enjoying this video. I also recommend Yoga Fitness for Kids ages 7-12 with Leah Kalish for elementary school age students--it's for kids but more serious while being fun, and seeing children their age (and older) doing the poses (and struggling with them, sometimes, too!) helps their self-esteem"

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,love it,"I don't know why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars. If you have ever taken dance class this DVD is superb for having variety.

dvd,,5.0,The Next challenge workout is an excellent Challenge,This dvd is great it can be as hard as you want it to be- do this 3 times a week and you will get the result you are looking for. It is very easy to follow and not borin
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,Good epic movie,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is about the story of Balian (Orlando Bloom) going to Jerusalem in an attempt to find forgiveness for himself and his wife who has committed suicide. That much is revealed early on, the rest of the movie is about the moral choices he makes to save the people and city of Jerusalem from idiot religious zealots within, and the Muslim army running out of reasons NOT to break the peace. It's a pretty long movie, so if you like epics then you should be pleased with this. There are also plently of bloody battle scenes if that's your thing, and the movie is pretty void of any comedic moments or characters. So basically, if you want a serious, fairly historically accurate film with lots of fight to death scenes and moral dilemmas then this is a movie worth checking out"

dvd,11 of 34,4.0,"If you hate skaters, watch this movie","If your kid is a total loser and headed for prison, it could be because you bought him that skateboard last year. This is a loser subculture if there ever was one, and this film does a great job of explaining why. Here we are in ""gritty"" Venice, California, back when a modest home was actually available for less than half a million bucks. We have a bunch of Timmie-from-Lassie kids who are surfers. They all come from broken homes and their moms, who are all waitresses, turn tricks at the Motel 6 if their tips don't make the nut for the day's drugs. The kids are befriended by a surf shop owner who sponsors them. Amazingly, he is not a chicken hawk. The surfer xenophobia toward anybody who is not from their neighborhood is trumpeted as a virtue. But since the surf blows out around ten in the morning, the kids have to find something else to do. Fortunately, some other kids who studied in school and made themselves useful to society invented polyurethane skateboard wheels so skating can become a mass-market phenomenon and skateboards can be sold at K-Mart instead of just gritty little surf shops on the beach. The kids imitate a Hawaiian surfer, who they'd probably bomb with bricks and broken glass if he tried to surf their miserable beach break. This imitation creates a whole new style that has defined skating for the world's youth. Fortunately, there was an older guy named Friedman hanging around to see if he couldn't make some money off this whole deal. The kids end up the stars of Surfer Magaine's skateboard publication and pretty soon skateboards are big again. Along come some guys with big bucks and the kids desert the humble board shaper who gave them flight. His shop goes bust and he has to get on welfare. The kids start bringing home big bucks. One day they discover skating in empty swimming pools, which is a direct result of the drought in California. They cruise around in seedy quasi-suburban neighborhoods looking for pools to drain. Then they find a rich kid who is dying of brain cancer and his dad drains their pool so the gritty Timmies can skate. The film does not show the kid with the brain cancer. I don't know what it is with surfer films, but those guys sure love to go on and on about themselves. It's like they think the longer they can make the film the more money they'll be making off it. "

dvd,6 of 6,5.0,"A War Time, Stir-'Em Up Movie, And Very Well Done ","It doesn't matter the war. It doesn't matter the country. It doesn't matter the rightness of the cause. A good propaganda movie hits one theme hard: Take a group of people and let the audience get to know and sympathize with them, then show them dying bravely and willingly in defense of hometown values, preferably against an enemy who is cruel. Wake Island follows this formula so effectively and professionally that, despite how dated some of it is, it still (at least for me) can get the emotional juices flowing."

dvd,1 of 2,5.0,You'll Need To Pay Attention With This One. It's Worth It.,"Following is the one of the cleverest, smartest, toughest psychological thrillers since...well...since Memento. Bill (Jeremy Theobald) is an unsuccessful wannabe writer. ""I've been on my own for a while,"" he tells an older man at the beginning of the movie, ""and getting kind of lonely...and bored...nothing to do all day. And that's when I started shadowing."" Bill will pick out a person and spend the day secretly following them around, seeing what they do and who they meet, what their lives are like. Fate, or something more sinister, takes a hand when he follows Cobb (Alex Haw) one day...and Cobb confronts him in a cafe. Cobb is about Bill's age, but he's smart and assured. And a thief. He breaks into people's flats and takes things, not just for the money. He convinces Bill, almost in a seduction, to follow him around while he does this. Bill is torn between fascination and unease, and fascination wins. Cobb explains to him that ""interrupting someone's life is what it's all about. Making them see all the things they take for granted."" One night Bill meets an attractive blond (Lucy Russell) in a nightclub owned by her boyfriend, an older, ruthless criminal who deals in drugs and pornography. As their relationship develops, so does his relationship with Cobb. Cobb may not be the best guy around to trust. Maybe not Lucy, either."

dvd,,5.0,Packs A Real Punch.,"Voted best film of the 1980s', Martin Scorsese's 1980 boxing tour de force ""Raging Bull"" is indeed one of the best movies ever made. Covering the life of famed boxer Jake La Motta (portrayed by Robert De Niro, whose physical transformation throughout the movie is as impressive as his performance, which is a contender for his best). Spanning 25 years through Jake's life, we see his rise and fall well documented. We see his struggle to keep his title, to stay fit, to maintain a solid family life as well as his relationship to his brother Joey (Joe Pesci). This is what true filmmamking is all about."

The choreography is interesting, but not too hard to pick up during the  first time you do the DVD.  The music is not annoying.  Karen Voight is not annoying.  It is fun and a good workout and worth the money.  I've only done this DVD once, but I was pleased with the DVD.  I will use it over and over. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Oh...Mama!,"Though not for younger children, this is a delightful movie and a great 'broadway style' film. Movies will never beat the intensity of a live stage, but this one has earned the timeless title of a 'classic'. The songs are terrific, the humor is great, and you won't want to miss the dentist scene between Steve Martin and Rick Moranis. If you like the plucky, Saturday Night style of humor (from the good old days), you'll want to get Little Shop of Horrors for your comedy collection"

dvd,12 of 13,4.0,Lombard's Legacy Preserved in an Often Dazzling Six-Film Collection,"The early death of Carole Lombard at 33 from a January 1942 plane crash remains one of cinema's most tragic episodes. During the 1930's, she was the most luminous of screen beauties yet innately likeable. What made her unique was the scintillating, often ribald and genuine manner in her performances. Even though she delivered top-notch dramatic performances, especially toward the end of her career, it is her comedies that continue to reinforce her legacy. It's almost impossible not to adore Lombard for the way she downplayed her looks, coming across as a proto-feminist in many of her roles. In fact, of all her contemporaries, Lombard still comes across as the most modern and self-aware, which is proven by this splendid two-disc set of six of her lesser known films. Granted none of them are close to the quality of her acknowledged classics - ""Twentieth Century"", ""My Man Godfrey"", ""Nothing Sacred"", ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", ""To Be or Not to Be"" - but each provides ample evidence of her abundant comic talent during the middle of her career between 1931 and 1937."
dvd,0 of 2,4.0,a bit different,its not like the others. it has a little twist.
dvd,1 of 1,2.0,Please let it be the Final,"Final Destination 3 is hopefully the final installment to this series. They have all been entertaining, gory, and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally. The acting has never been first rate, horror movies rarely offer Oscar worthy performances. The formula has always been followed, someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their ""get out of death "" free card to the grim reaper. The main characters must figure out the order of death, and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely. By this third movie, it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation. The tanning beds, the nail gun, the motor chopping off heads, and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius. The extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time, I don't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates (besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense) I have read other reviews on here, and I have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster shouldn't have showed their grim fates, if they all were supposed to die on the ride, Did death know she would save them? If so than that changes everything, its not really cheating death than is it? Oh well, anyway, watch this if you have some free time, and if you liked the first two, its an okay , hopefully the end to this played out series."

The humor is dry and intelligent, and the characters are very complex: at times, you feel sorry for them; other times, you love them and laugh with them; and mostly, you think they're idiots.

The bellydancer is very talanted and there is a warm up, shimmy drills, and 3 dances to learn from beginning to advanced - within those are the performance, chorography and chorography breakdown.  The drummer is great too, there is even a rhythm workshop with the drummer and the bellydancer.  She talks as if you're right there with her, love it!  "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,s-p-e-l-l-b-i-n-d-i-ng....,"If I am going to come away with anything from this intelligent, engaging little film, it's that spelling bees are aired on ESPN for a damned good reason.  It truly is a competitive test of endurance, placed on the heads and shoulders of very young, ambitious kids.  You will walk away with a new feeling of respect for those young ladies and gentlemen who have the guts and minds that get them up on that stage, in front of a crowd of hundreds (and countless thousands who are watching them on television) go for the goal.  "
dvd,1 of 1,4.0,Spine-bending,"Even if you haven't read the book you'll probably get the message of this film. Most of the ideas have filtered into the consciousness of Western man, especially the phrase Big Brother is Watching You. Surely everyone knows what this means. The cast is perfect: Burton, Cusack, Hamilton, Hurt seem to fit their parts exactly. It was a shock to be told that the location shots were filmed in areas of London that actually were in existence in 1984. I recognized Battersea Power Station, and London University Senate House. Those places reflect the totalitarianism of the 1930s, the decade that produced WWII. The book was written in 1948 (obviously), which was only 3 years after the ending of the war. The fact is that conditions in post-war Britain were almost worse than during the war itself. Austerity was the watchword. Rationing prevailed. Bombsite rubble was everywhere in London. Russia, the former ally, was now the enemy. Orwell was working for the BBC, and he must have developed a sensitivity to the potential ways in which the public could be deceived and manipulated. It didn't take much projecting to imagine how things threatened to develop, especially with the history of the pre-war Communist show-trials and executions, and rantings of Nazi oratory to draw on. All this is very well depicted in the film. The warning of the book was that these things weren't happening in Eurasia (Nazi Germany) or Eastasia (Russia) but in Oceania (US and UK). Airstrip One was the UK re-named: a place for transatlantic bombers to land and take off from. The national anthem was titled: Oceania,'Tis of thee. So Orwell's satire was targeting home territory. The threat of an everchanging enemy meant a way to keep the home population under control. The vision is utterly bleak. However, if the film has a flaw, it is that the visual shabbiness is almost too much. It's just a little over the top: and if the settings had been a fraction less threadbare and brutal, then thoughtcrime and its cure could perhaps have been even more chilling. Difficult to tell. John Hurt --- what a name for the part.  "

dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Bardolatry at its finest!,"This is the film that made Brigitte Bardot a legend. I have to admit: I have tried to look at this film objectively and I find it alternately demeaning, silly, and just plain dumb. So how come I'm giving it five stars? One word: Bardot. If you were to assemble a dictionary that would use visuals to illustrate the various words, Bardot's mambo sequence would authoritatively define the word ""sensual."" With the pulsating sound of the bongos in the background punctuated by blaring horns, Brigitte is larger than life dancing from room to room like a woman possessed. This may not be acting but it sure holds your attention - kind of like watching a human being transform into a wild animal. This sequence tells you all you need to know about why Bardot is a legend even in her senior years. And no, I don't believe And God Created Woman's silly ending in which we are expected to believe that a few slaps from Jean Louis Trintignant are enough to turn Bardot into a submissive French housewife. On the other hand, I don't think audiences in the 1950's were ready to deal with the reality of a sexually liberated woman like Brigitte. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,EXTRAORDINARY WW2 COLLECTIION FROM DISNEY,"This collection represents the best animated shorts from WW2, and presents them in Disney's unique and original way...as always, Disney does it like no one else can. Some are informative, some are amusing and some are really chilling, e.g., ""Education for Death"" which gives a POV about what it must have been like for so many children growing up in the shadow of Hitler and his Nazi goons, and it truly disturbing and sad. ""Der Fuerher's Face"" provided real relief for not only children here in the USA at the time, but for adults as well. Like showing the monster in the closet in the daytime...thus diminishing the terrors at night. By deriding something and shrinking it down to a level where Donald Duck can attack and make fun of Hitler, it diminishes, somewhat, the horror that this man represented."

I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked"
dvd,18 of 18,1.0,Horrible DVD,There is not one reason to purchase this DVD.  Neither kids or adults will enjoy it.  I was hoping for something along the lines of America's Funniest Home Videos (WITHOUT Bob Saget) but it did not even live up to that weak standard.  A total disappointment.  Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy watching overweight folks perform pig calls at a county fair.  That is the type of material (I kid you not) that is on this DVD.  I only hope I can get rid of it on eBay so I don't have to look at it in my DVD collection
dvd,7 of 8,5.0,"Proud to be an American, and Proud to Watch this Movie","I can't recall ever seeing a more thoughtful documentary on the most recent of our nation's military efforts.  What separates the American experience from that of almost every other ""empire"" throughout history is the fact that critics of our government are allowed to voice their opposing views.  Efforts by some to paint a message like this as anti-American are disengenuous and downright wrong."

dvd,,4.0,"Will also use the word ""surprising"" for this film","A lot of good directors will tell you good stories can often fall apart if the casting is bad. There are particular actors and actresses that are not terrible in their respective films but they feel woefully out of place among the talent around them (Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection or Denise Richards in the World is Not Enough). In this case, it's Adam Sandler who actually doesn't even feel miscast. He does a very respectable job at getting away from his Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison schtick but this time instead of being miscast, he just seems like a lightning rod for miscasting rants from people."

What is the appeal of crossword puzzles? This entertaining and informative documentary answers this question."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,Everytime I watch i cry!,"Being first generation in an Asian American family, my sisters and i can really relate to this movie.  We watch it about once a year with our mom (who is Chinese) and we always laugh and cry.  My favorite part is the scene with Waverly bringing home her boyfriend to meet the family and how the cultures clash.  We made our boyfriends (who are all white) watch that scene especially so they know how to act.  The part that always brings the most tears is the scene with June and her mom after the crab leg supper.  Very typical of Asian American families espcially if you are the first born of immigrants.  Recommended for all mothers and daughters to watch"
dvd,,4.0,Very funny parody of mafia movies.............,"The Freshman is a very funny movie.  The central joke is that Marlon Brando plays a godfather type figure in lower Manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character Brando so famously portrayed.    Matthew Broderick is the freshman, an innocent NYU film student, who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with Brando and his ""family"".  The funniest scenes involve a  Komodo dragon  loose in a New Jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy.  The movie has no real violence  and though there are a few mild ""bad"" words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families.      "

dvd,6 of 9,1.0,Very bad movie....,"My title is pretty obvious, but this film is garbage.  I love dark cinema, but I just hated this tripe.  It has an overriding smugness and self satisfaction (very typical of the 1990s') that overtakes any comedic elements in it.  The hysterical performances (especially Daniel Stern) end up being unintentionally hilarious, because they are so ridiculously over the top, and I don't think that was the point.  It was like Peter Berg went out to make a really vile, disgusting film, without any taste, substance, class, or intelligence.  Berg did an interview where he said ""yeah, throw things at the screen.  I know it's horrible.""  It reminds me of when Jerry Springer used to say ""I know my show is trash"", thinking that excuses him for making it.  It doesn't.  Trash is trash, even if you know you're making it.  You can have the most heinous subject matter in the world, but if there is intelligence and sincerity behind it, it can work brilliantly as a comedy (Dr. Strangelove is the greatest example of this).  The Belgian film Man Bites Dog is more similar in tone to this film, and that film is hilarious, because there's intelligence and real wit behind it.  This is just an attempt at cheap shock value.  It's not funny, and is definitely not worth your time.       "
dvd,14 of 47,2.0,Where's the Maharishi when you need him?,"I thought, since this was a Criterion Collection flick, that it was gonna be a psychedelic, spaced-out trip through India with heavy Ravi Shankar music, incense, and flower children with bells and long hair trying to ""find themselves"". It was about as far away from that as anyone could get, but it was WEIRD nonetheless. Basically, it's the story of a bunch of rich white people living in India on some sort of plantation, far from the everyday realities of India itself in their luxurious palace. When I found out the plot I was immediately turned off, because I hate movies about rich white people, especially when they slum around in foreign countries ripping off the local economy through some sort of corporate pseudo-slave labor arrangement, sitting back on their plantations acting all sophisticated in white linen clothing."
dvd,5 of 14,1.0,Surprisingly disappointing,"Not only is this film not well produced, with relatively poor visuals and a less-than-quality soundtrack but it leaves one completely unsatisfied.  The violent scenes are unnecessary and provide little but visual uncomfortableness throughout the entire movie.  I was expecting something much more  based on prior reviews.   I found the film falling far short of where it  could have gone - disappointing and puzzling"
dvd,4 of 5,4.0,Best Episode Ever!,"This is the season I've been waiting for - where the BN show really hit its stride, but especially because it contains the best episode ever: ""Carol at 6:01"", where Carol's husband Larry is so needy that it drives Carol nuts.  Although the highlight of the episode is just prior to an act break where Bob, Jerry, et al. plan their revenge on Howard, who has been winning at ""Chinese poker."" A must-see"
dvd,,5.0,spirituality in scientific terms,"I found this to be an inspiring, thoughtful, and extremely interesting take at the new paradigm of science, quantum mechanics.  This movie explains in non-technical terms the philosophical ramifications of the theory (almost universally accepted) and how it is relevant to our everyday lives--even non-physicists.  In it are interviews of many well credentialed and credible physicists, philosophers, and theologians, making it engaging for even the most cynical of viewers.  Interspersed is a drama showing the theories in action for a regular person.  For me, it helps to reconcile spirituality (Christian in my case) and scientific theory whereas before I always felt my love of science and reason were in constant conflict with my spiritual beliefs.  No longer!  Watch the movie, which is for the most part not dogmatic and not judgmental but instead eye-opening and logically satisfying even for the ""religious.""  I love it"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderfully Complicated Family Life and Values,"I loved this movie!  I wasn't going to rent it because I'm not crazy about Dermot Mulroney, so my Son lent me his copy, and now I'm hooked! The rest of the cast is superb!  This movie had me feeling meloncholy and warm and then it broke me out into laughter and lastly, tears. An emotional roller coaster and worth every second!  The characters come off as real people who makes mistakes; lot's and lot's of mistakes, and that's okay, because we're all human! I recommended this movie to ALL my family relatives, and now they all want the movie too!  Doesn't get any better than word of mouth.  I believe if you watch this movie, it won't disappoint you!  Happy Holidays!!"
dvd,3 of 6,4.0,Very sweet and entertaining,Edge of Seventeen is a very enjoyable movie. I found myself rewatching it over and over again. Theres nothing to spectacular about it. Its just a typical coming out and coming to terms movie. I just found that the main character is very sweet and charming in a innocent way. The plot was very st8 foward and basic with a few little tid bits to living it up. The film was made in the 80s and is a bit dated. But if you just want to see a decent film concerning the gay lifestyle or coming out this definatly buy this film. You wont be dissapointed
dvd,13 of 13,5.0,Beautiful!  You can't beat a BBC period drama!,"I love Elizabeth Gaskell, a Victorian author that was sadly overshadowed by the likes of the Bronte sisters and Charles Dickens.  She was a talent in her own right and I enjoyed reading her novels.  North and South and Wives and Daughters were her most successful novels and two of my favorites of all time, which is why I had to watch the BBC adaptations of the same.  The adaptation of Wives and Daughters is beautifully done -- it kept (almost) true to the novel and I enjoyed all four episodes.  The fact that the adaptation was written and produced by the same creators of the A&E/BBC Pride and Prejudice makes things all the better.  Molly Gibson lives a content life with her father, a respectable doctor, in the countryside.  But things change when, after spending many years alone as a widower, Mr. Gibson decides to remarry.  Molly's new mother, Claire, is a governess Molly had met briefly when she was a little girl.  The woman is self-absorbed, pompous, selfish and has airs of grandeur.  When Claire's daughter, Cynthia Kirkpatrick, moves in with them, Molly likes to have a new sister and they get along well, but when Roger Hamley, her friend and love of her life, falls for the flirtatious, attention-getter, much prettier Cynthia, Molly is heartbroken.

dvd,2 of 2,5.0,surprisingly great,"When I first saw this on release I wasn't expecting much, and by the end of it I was blown away.  This is Jolie's best action flick and she has some really nice comic timing which I'd never seen before, certainly not in the Tomb Raider films.  Pitt is about what you'd expect in a ""light"" mode, he's not as intense as in films like Kalifornia or Fight Club, but this is just a fun summer thing and he seems to be having a great time.  "

Maybe adults get a kick out of it, my 10 year old brother (at the time) enjoyed it. So, if you're an older viewer than maybe this movie is good, but please, keep it away from young children. This movie terrified me as a small child and I ran out halfway through nearly in tears. Please, doen't be overly anxious to share this with your kids, it may be best to wait a few years. It is one of the most terrifying memories I have as a little girl and I certainly wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone else"

The first-edition packaging of this set included a relatively large, and sturdy 6 x 8 x 3 inch folding box. Stored in this box were three disks (two DVDs and one CD), and a miniature art booklet. The outside of the collectors box was a beauty to behold, as the artwork on the back and front sides were done in a glossy finish. Only 10,000 units of the first edition were ever made."

dvd,42 of 43,5.0,"Too Short, But Still Delightful",Two episodes and approximately 2 to 2 1/2 hours is not enough time to do justice to Nancy Mitford's hilarious and moving novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate.

However, my only problem with it, is the limited amount of time devoted to an episode.

She's supportive, gives great cues, and best of all, sincere. She's not cheesy like most workout divas. Her work out are great too- I always work up a sweat and I'm definately stronger since doing her routines. Slim and sleek which is more leg focused,as opposed to Bikini Ready Fast which feels more focused on the arms, though each part of the body is worked hard. "
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Our Kids LOVE this dvd and burn Lots of Energy with it!!,"Great workout for our kids & us parents too....simple to follow, very effective, and our 4 kids from baby to pre-teen jump in and kick.  The coach is very optimistic and positive.  I also like the extra defense techniques shown to children.   It was very much worth the money....especially good on Rainy and Snowy Days"
dvd,13 of 14,5.0,very sweet romance,"Okay, I'm a sap for a romantic comedy; I like a happy ending, so sue me.  This movie is funny and sweet, well acted, and has great production values.  The characters are very endearing and seem like real, everyday kind of guys.  The second time I watched it was even better because there was much I missed or didn't appreciate the first time.  Definitely worth buying and watching over and over"
dvd,8 of 11,5.0,Pathological Profit Machines,"Whether you are talking about new technologies that save lives, a book that changed your perspective on the world, the horrible conditions of sweatshops or exposure to cancer-causing agents; you are essentially talking about corporations - the fundamental unit of global economics, and by default, the institution which holds the fate of the planet in its legally personified hands. "
dvd,,5.0,a great love story,"I'm not a foreign film buff, by any stretch - but I loved this movie!  In fact, my 14-year-old daughter loved it too, subtitles and all.  It's charming, with moments of subtle humor, and is ultimately a testament to the power of a great love.  We originally checked it out from the library, but decided that we wanted to own it because it's the kind of film you want to see more than once.  Don't miss this one"
dvd,8 of 10,5.0,Not from the Biography Channel...,"I pre-ordered this as soon as I was able, being a Huge fan of Mr. Gould, and not disappointed in the least. Those whose roots with Gould are not quite that deep yet, I would suggest some of the other DVD titles listed here on Amazon first. This isn't your typical biography produced for the masses, but more focused on Gould's craft & thoughts. There are many  unscripted scenes that had been previously been introduced to the editor, where you witness Mr.Gould seeking perfection in the recording studio.  I could go on & on, but would like to thank Bruno Monsaingeon for producing another treasure about Glen Gould. A must have"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Plotless yet charming,"I just saw this on television, and really enjoyed it. I don't want to repeat too many reviewers, so I'll keep this brief and say that most people who are accustomed to pondering their self-worth will get a lot out of this film. You'll likely see a bit of yourself in each character."
dvd,0 of 2,5.0,""". . . what I say to my victims before I kill them.  I  like the sound of it . . .""","Jack Nicholson's Joker is a performance for the ages - and one to which perhaps more of us should take heed.  Egoistic misanthropy and callous disregard for life have exponentially exploded among our species since the great actor's wild parody of the sins of the ""Me Generation"".  To me, the speeches of our nation's political and corporate leaders at times hauntingly echo Nicholson's Joker's now classic harangues - and private corporate armies? Is there really much difference between Blackwater and the ""Joker's men""?"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Hong Kong Superhero movie done good,I can&#8217;t remember ever seeing a superhero Hong Kong action movie. You would think it would be something obvious to do considering the dynamic action styling of Hong Kong action films. Sounds like a good idea? Well The Black Mask delivers on that idea. Combine insane stunt work and martial arts choreography along with a masked crime fighter and you get a superhero movie with action that will put Hollywood to shame. 
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Sweet & Beautiful,"IF YOUR A BEATLE/GEORGE HARRISON FAN, AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS DVD, THEN YOUR NOT A FAN. IT IS THE BEST PERFORMED TRIBUTE CONCERT EVER CONCEIVED. LAID-BACK GEORGE HIMSELF I'M SURE WOULD BE PROUD OF THIS EFFORT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SONGS PEFORMED AND HIS ORIGINAL RECORDINGS IS THAT GEORGE IS NOT THERE HIMSELF TO SING THEM. VERY MOVING, CAPTIVATING AND END'S POIGNANTLY WITH JOE BROWN'S ""I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS"". AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE, AND HEAR IN DTS."

I sent it back for exchange, and received another identical disk that it too would not play.  I sent it back for a refund, and was never able to view it.  I never thought to try it in my computer, bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue. Oddly, the DVD has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all DVD players in the US.."
dvd,0 of 1,5.0,for whom the bell tolls,"A hollywood classic at it's best.  Ingrid Bergman displays innocents, warmth and the sincerity of a woman coming to terms with the cruelity of war.  Gary Cooper is the hero, brave true and uncompromising in the face of danger...Their love story is beautiful to the eye and raises the spirit of human courage to new heights.."
dvd,3 of 6,4.0,gold,four rooms is gold
dvd,,4.0,you need to be awake to watch this....,"i went into this DVD with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it.  maybe ""enjoy"" isn't the right word, it is intense, it is political (and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics)and it jumps around from subplot to subplot.  in fact, i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks.  but I found it very plausible. and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out.  it succeeds here.  it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence.  Sure, it makes the Gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them, but that usually makes for a good starting point, since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway. I once heard a history professor say "" it isn't about the struggle of good vs evil, it is always about the struggle of good vs good....both sides always think they are right and God is on their side""..... Watch it, you will come out the other side thinking. "
dvd,1 of 4,5.0,Watch This...It's Reality In Your Face,All those so-called 'reality' shows that we see on TV every single day aren't about reality - it's entertainment. This documentary is about some of the harshest realities of life.
dvd,4 of 6,5.0,Season One:  The Holy Grail of '60s Sci-Fi!,"            This is the first and best season of TOS.  Some of my own favorites from this season are ""Miri"" guest starring Kim Darby on a duplicate Earth (though a cloudless one) where only kids have survived a longevity experiment gone haywire.  But Grup Kirk comes to the rescue with ""NO BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!""  and Kim's subtlety is a good foil to Shatner's intensity.  Also here is one of the ""kids"" Michael Pollard who was 26 at the time.  That one kid is so annoying, the one who always shouts ""BONK BONK ON THE HEAD!""   Spock, who a few episodes earlier was saying stuff like, ""Ah yes, one of your Earth emotions"", is here explaining Miri's emotions to the others.  "
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Easy to learn from!,This DVD would be great for kids/teens. Moves along nicely but slow enough to learn the choreography (taught from the back too...which makes learning SO much easier). Very new in terms of style...not something I've seen before. Would be great for hip-hop newcomers!!
dvd,,4.0,Still a lot of laughs in this old thing...,"Jane Fonda is best taken on screen in small doses, and the presence of the ace funny girl Lily Tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside, good-girl inside Dolly Parton in supporting roles help this project immensely. My favorite actor in this one, however, is Dabney Coleman as the evil boss. There are a few excesses, including a marijuana scene which rings false"

dvd,7 of 7,5.0,"""Sometimes truth defies reason.""","The Meiks brothers had a troubled childhood. Very troubled. Their mother had died after Adam was born, leaving his older brother Fenton to take care of him with the help of their father. The three males seemed to fend well for themselves, not running into too many bumps in their simple yet strange road in life. It was a fairly close-knit family with plenty of pleasant memories and more to come. But all of that changed one night when Dad (curiously, his name was never revealed in the film, being credited as ""Dad Meiks"") rushed into the boys' room, flipped on the light, woke them up, and began to unravel an unusual tale that would change the very course of their lives in a most dramatic way. Dad had been visited by an angel - an angel sent by God himself. The heavenly apparition told him of his new calling: to be a destroyer of demons. According to the angel, the biblical end times had come and there were demons of Hell now walking among mortal man, disguised as humans. Dad would be given sacred weapons from the angel soon, and thereafter he would receive a list. The list held the names of the demons in disguise - names that appeared to be mere human identities, but, just like the demons themselves, were simply cover-ups for the true evil that lurked in their soul. It was now up to this family of three to become warriors of God. The young Adam obeyed his father and came to believe every bit of it. But Fenton was disturbed by these ideas, insisting to himself that his father had lost his mind and nothing this crazy could be real. Yet surely enough, step by step, it all began becoming a reality. The main slaughtering weapon had been retrieved - an abandoned axe in an old shed, with gloves by its side. They came to find out, that the gloves were for Dad to use when capturing the demons and bringing them back to the house. Because when he would remove the gloves and touch them with his bare hands, he could see their dark sin nature and know for sure who they really were. They weren't humans of course, they were pathetic demons - no match for the wrath of God that was being handed out through this divinely chosen man and his sons. At first Fenton wanted to run away and get help. But as time moved on, trapped within this world of madness and extremism, he began to question his reality as a whole. Could he brake away from this terrible mess he'd been drawn into, or was he destined to become a demon-slayer, just as his father was, and just as his brother would come to be? Years later, as a full-grown adult, he gets a frantic phone call from his brother. Shortly after, he decides to give FBI agent Wesley Doyle a visit and finally relieve himself of these secrets that have plagued him all his life. At first Doyle is confused as to why he would come to him to reveal the mystery behind the ""God's Hand"" serial killer case. Yet once he unveils this deranged tale and the story progresses, they take a trip to the burial site of the victims, where reality warps and warps until it all comes into focus. It turns out that the truth is more twisted than the viewer could have ever imagined."
dvd,5 of 6,4.0,john wayne gives the  marines air support,"typical world war two aviation yarn starring the duke as the tough as nails squadron commander. good supporting cast. a plus for the film is the fact that its shot in color, a rarity for this type of film at the time. if you like john wayne and ww2, you'll like flying leatherneck"
dvd,5 of 5,4.0,There's a burn... surprisingly!,"The first few times I did this video, I was focusing on the poses and didn't really feel the burn. It all felt too slow-mo, compared to Bryan Kest's power yoga videos. But at about the sixth time I did the video, I ""slowed down"" even more, and realised that the slower you do the poses, the more difficult they become, and the more burn there is. Which made it quite strange cos now, my practises on this video feel alot more difficult than the first few times I did it. It could be all in the mind. But as Yee proposes in this video, it is all about ""mindfulness"". So for those who don't seem to feel any ""burn"", how about trying it this way - do it even more slowly, be in the present and focus fully on what you're doing, and on the sensations, and maybe you'll start feeling it - which I did, in my arms and thighs!"
dvd,,4.0,Worth one's time,"The personality of the main character, Dr. House, is a breather from having to be PC all the time and it based on the notion of being brutally honest.  That the main character does not make allowances for diplomacy is based on the notion that he has no time for stupidity.  Therefore some people find House tiring and overly caustic, but it makes for great entertainment.  The medical info is always challenging and I enjoy googling it afterwards.  The series is one of the more intelligent ones on TV and one can actually learn from it"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Classic movie. All of the fighting scenes were excellent, no flaws in them. People dislike the fact that they glide over buildings etc, like they are flying. Big deal its just a movie, and adds a different type of twist to the movie. The music of course, goes along with the movie, and the scenery that its filmed in is nice of course. ""Michelle Yeoh"" and ""Ziyi Zhang"" both act excellent in the movie, just with the normal acting and especially in the fighting scenes. I highly recommend this movie to ALL Kung Fu fans and for people that want a good story line in a movie. Because this movie, it does follow a story line, its not just fighting here and fighting there. So I highly recommend it, youll love the fighting scenes also"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Pleasantly quirky,"I love this movie because both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are so quirky.  Together they have this strange but amusing chemistry that draws you in and makes you hope for their ultimate connection.  Most who like romantic comedies will like this movie however, if you're one that is on the fence when it comes to watching ""hollywood love stories"" then this movie is not your style"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,"Another ""must see"" for history students.","As with all movies about history, I review them from the perspective of the history teacher and leave all of the other particulars to the other reviewers. In this case, however, I'd like to address the Amazon review (written by Dave McCoy) as well. McCoy states that the director (noneother than Steven Speilberg) feels compelled ""to entertain with beautiful images and contrived emotion . . . [and] . . . cheapens his grandiose motives and simplifies slavery, treating it as cut- and-dry genre piece. Characters are easy Hollywood stereotypes--'villains' like the Spanish sailors or zealous abolitionists are drawn one-dimensionally and sneered upon."" For the record, I'll say that I agree wholeheartedly---but in this case, an excellent movie still unfolds and a story that SHOULD be told is told! Also, let me address a fellow reviewer's (Leon Washington) remark that those who slam this movie are guilty of racism. I don't necessarily think that those who give this movie bad reviews are categorically racist, but I do think they may be missing the ""big picture"" here. Alright, let's get on with the review."
dvd,,4.0,FELICITY TRANSFORMED,"Felicity Huffman is fantasic in this movie..a woman, playing a man, trying to become a woman..now that is a tough assignment and Huffman hits it out of the park.  I really thought she deserved the Oscar, but im sure her being on a nighttime, prime time soap, did not help her to be taken seriously in this great performance.  The actor that plays her son is good as well, and drop dead hot, he and Huffman have great chemistry so that when she must tell him the secret she has been keeping you feel the angst they both feel at this revelation.  Wonderful performances through out, the actress the plays Huffman's mother is fantastic, she really nails the part.  I highly recommend this movie, even if maybe the subject matter is something that your not that comfortable with, this film is worth the time of a viewing, you come away feeling better for the effort."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Kinda Accurate,"As someone who's experienced some similar things, I can say this film is pretty accurate.  The Sixth Sense wasn't even close.  Besides, after A Pure Formality and Final Approach, I already knew what the twist in that film would be.  Particularly realistic in Stir of Echoes was the involuntary and unconscious urges, instincts, and blurtings that occured.  When my great grandfather died I did exactly the same thing Bacon's character does at the kitchen table over orange juice.  I was like three at the time.  Ditto when I found out about my sister being pregnant and blurting out ""it's a girl.""  The flashes of red in this film, while not accurate, are a good metaphor for the emotional charges or flashes you perceive.  Do I know what causes this stuff or why I can do this and not others?  Is it dead people causing it?  The zietgeist or whatever?  Can I start describing the way the universe is or prescribing a particular philosophy you should adhere to?  I haven't got a frigg'n clue, but not only is this a well made film, with good acting, photography, music, sound effects, and writing, but it also portrays this phenomenon in a way that makes me think someone involved in its creation had first hand experience with it.  It'd be nice to say I've followed through with things like Bacon's character does, but I got to admit usually I've chickened out.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then just enjoy it as a film.  The only negative comment I can make is the last act can seem a bit rushed, but the resolution is quite satisfying, especially for a chicken like me"
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,Mamet Writes and Directs and Val Kilmer Gives a Great Performance,"The one thing you must understand is David Mamet is a master wordsmith.  His plays and films are about the words said.  The difficult thing is he also likes to repeat key phrases and overlay conversations - that is have two precisely timed conversations going on at the same time.  Therefore, pay close attention to what is being said."
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Great show but huge downer.....,I wanted to buy this cause i watched it a few times and never finished it so i looked and it shows the COMPLETE COLLECTION for only $44 so boohaa but when i got my dvd it only is the 1st complete collection which was the bummer. it shows in the picture its complete and it also says it has 7 dvds which only has 4 so if you want this just cause its cheaper then be my guest but if you want to get the complete collection this aint it.

dvd,6 of 7,5.0,Please don't think this is Japanese anime,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is indeed the best show to air on Nick since the 1980's, but this show is 100% American. From the co-creators, producers, and often writers Bryan Konietzko (Invader Zim storyboardist to Art Director) and Michael Dante DiMartino (direction of various episodes of Family Guy, King of the Hill, and one of Mission Hill (an adult swim show) to the American directors, writers, musicians, and storyboardists. It is true the show is animated in Korea but so is every other animation project these days, Korea is where the costs are lowest and hence everyone sends their work there - including most of the Japanese anime you've seen in the past 10 years."

dvd,6 of 7,5.0,felt like giving Gilliam a hug and organizing a fund-raiser,"to enable him to complete his movie and i don't even like the story of Don Quixote that much! But what very little of the Gilliam's Don Quixote we are able to see of the  movie is enough to left one hungry for more (which makes La Mancha worth buying all by itself, really, as even a taste is better than none)... It IS a shame that the movie can not be completed not because it is heatbreaking (which it is) but because proves Gilliam he IS a real visionary and his movie is a real masterpiece and it is everybody's loss that the movie is not completed..."
dvd,,1.0,I don't think I laughed once and afterwards I felt bad for all of humanity,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.  The trailer is pretty hilarious but it's a film (and I use the word ""film"" in its broadest sense) that just doesn't work.  "
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,You're a reporter!,"Howard Hawks was responsible for a lot of outstanding movies, like ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Bringing Up Baby."" But one of his best was wild, witty screwball comedy ""His Girl Friday,"" with Cary Grant as (once more) a divorced man who won't give up so easily. You'll never look at a rolltop desk the same way again."
dvd,1 of 4,1.0,Has the whole world gone mad?,"An average customer review of almost 4 stars?  Have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia?  Jason supposedly went to hell yeah?  Then why is still in one piece.  This time round, the government realise there's nothing they can do to stop Jason and have him captured.  He is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm.  Unfortunatley, he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space! Yes space!  The budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good.  There may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it's just not enough! This sequel sounds more like a Star Trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good Friday the 13th flick.  Supposedly, a TWELFTH Friday the 13th movie is being made (if you count the excellent Freddy Vs Jason).  While Freddy Vs Jason was indeed impressive, there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore"
dvd,5 of 7,1.0,Another cheapo DVD from Lions Gate/Artisan,"My rating is for the DVD, not the film, which is one of the best Lovecraft adaptations ever put on screen.  Unfortunately, the cinematic morons at Lions Gate didn't deem the film worthy of a special edition, which shows you just how much they know about the horror genre: Zero!  Instead, they give us a bare bones DVD with a full screen transfer, which means you get only slightly better quality than the old VHS.  Who the heck watches full screen movies anymore?  Lions gate had no business releasing this film.  They should have licnensed it a DVD compnay that knows what they're doing, such as Blue Underground, Anchor Bay or Synapse to name but a few"
dvd,0 of 3,4.0,DISNEY VAULT,Does anyone know when and if this title is going back into the Disney vault????? 
dvd,16 of 17,4.0,Great Flick,"The movie takes a while to get into; actually it's better on the second viewing because you can focus in on the character shifts, story arcs, and other subtle changes.  I brought this movie based on other's reviews and I have not regretted it.  The special feature section which explains how the movie was made, charcter's development, and some of the rehearsals is great.  My only disappointment came with the sex scences.  Given the compelxity of the movie and its stories lines I expected them to be more graphic and explicit, they seemed a little ""demure"". "
dvd,9 of 9,5.0,one of the best of its kind,"""Virtual Encounters"" is one of the better erotic soft-core DVDs I've seen. There are lots of crummy ones out there, but this one does NOT disappoint. True, there's not a lot of story to it beyond a girl getting caught up in erotic virtual reality scenes, but since most of the DVD consists of those scenes, how much story could you have? You've gotta make your choice. If I counted correctly, there are 8 boy-girl scenes, 2 girl-girl, and 1 boy-girl-girl. Anyone who complains about the actors in this must live at the Playboy Mansion, because to me they all look great and are very sexy. Two of my favorite scenes are with the bodacious Taylor St. Claire, one with her as a sizzling stripper who brings a guy from the audience onto the stage with her, and in the other, she's dominating another woman in a dungeon in a manner too hot to describe here. Other big name contributors are Jacqueline Lovell and Jill Kelly. Overall, the disc gets pretty close to x-rated, and to avoid that a few parts of scenes are done in a rather fake looking manner. For example, there's full frontal nudity of the women, but they had to compromise realism a little in order not to show men's privates and to avoid an x-rating. Other than that, they sure don't hold back much. The disc also has a nice extra with previews of 4 other Surrender Cinema DVDs. Overall, ""Virtual Encounters"" is very impressively acted and filmed, and there are quite many really HOT scenes in here. Especially at the very moderate price, this one is a winner! "

dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Genial Music Video,"Flashback.  Spring 1983.  I'm huddled with my fellow English majors at Temple University commiserating over the latest Woody Allen snoozer.  ""Flashdance"" comes up and derisive laughter emits from the elitist swine.  A few months later same film was playing free of charge at the student movie theatre.  Try as I must the sight of Jenny and the off-the-shoulder sweatshirt was too much of an enticement.  Oh, well!  What's the loss of a few brain cells?  Flash forward.  Spring 2006.  Jenny comes calling again.  How has this confection held up?  Very well, thank you.  For sure it's predictable, preposterous, and formulaic.  If the formula works, why complain?  What is the legacy of this cultural milestone of the Reagan era?  It probably begat ""Showgirls"", ""Striptease"", and ""Coyote Ugly"".  It also spawned a porn parody, ""Fleshdance"".  In the eighties Paramount seemed to have it's finger on the national zeitgeist with films like ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Footloose"", ""Top Gun"", ""Crocodile Dundee"", and ""Beverly Hills Cop"".  What did that say about us as a people?  Darned if I know!  Irene Cara got an Oscar for the title song(Martin Scorsese still doesn't have one).  Anybody interested in Jennifer Beals' subsequent filmwork should check her out in the superb ""Devil in a Blue Dress"".  I haven't seen her on ""The 'L' Word"" because I don't have Showtime"

dvd,6 of 9,1.0,"Hand in the ""Honey Pot""...","This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very ""hush-hush"" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle."
dvd,,1.0,DUMB WITH A CAPITAL D!!!!,"The criminal goes from being the dumbest air marshall to the dumbest criminal, Jodie Foster over-overacts (what has she ever done since Bugsy Malone that was decent), the sentimental hogwash flows like so much syrip, and, the best actor is the little girl who sleeps through most of the movie like the poor folks who had to watch this Hollywood drivel.  No wonder people are staying home!  Terrible, Dumb, Stupid, and whatever adjectives you may want to come up with.  How anyone could rate this 4 stars is beyond me.  Tells me how stupid the human race is"
dvd,,5.0,Kinky,"Not only because I am Clive's biggest supporters, but this film blew me away!!!! I bought a copy and I love watching this particular movie many many times. The story line was intense and I sure would not have said no if he were my brother! OMG I got to see my sexy man nude! This movie has it all as far as I am concerned. Excellent cast and a nice story ending too."
dvd,,5.0,It's sweet without being sticky. ,"This is among my favorite Christmas movies. This movie's strength is in the understated characters. I can honestly say that only one person is overacting in this film, (guess who?)  and it works. It's easy to forget this is a fantasy. The actors were so laid back it comes off like a simple family tale. Kudos especially to Ed Asner, whose gruff but kind Santa is among the best portrayals of the Jolly Old Elf in cinema.  And I still rewind every scene Faison is in. "
dvd,4 of 11,5.0,Long Before Brokeback Mountain,"there was ""The Adventures Of Spin & Marty"".  Along with Perkins The Butler, played by Deputy Dawg look-alike J. Pat O'Malley, these two boys rip up the Mild West.  A little known fact is that Mel Brooks used this show as a jumping-off point for ""Blazing Saddles""."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful and Original,"Dead Like Me is one of the most original shows I have seen.  It is about a young woman who dies and reluctantly becomes a Grimm Reaper, plus she has to hold down a day job.  The plot and premise are great, but the really beauty of the show is in the characters and the acting.  All the characters are interesting, funny, and very different.  The great dialog is advanced even more by the acting, which is wonderful.  This show is definatly worth watching"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,A good movie for Gwyneth,"Not being a huge Gwyneth Paltrow fan I was skeptical the first time I saw this.  I was very pleasantly surprised, the story is interesting, the acting is good, and the characters are real.  I recommend this to anyone who might be interested in a slightly different romantic comedy"
dvd,0 of 1,4.0,What can I say?,A Movie that will make you wonder if it could be true. It made you wonder what would happen next or if they would be able to stop it in time and did not come with the normal hollywood happy ending that we all wait for. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie
dvd,,5.0,black dog,"the film was excellant there was lots of action, there was also great well known actors in it to, there was no bad langauge and no sex scene's"
dvd,1 of 4,1.0,Terrible,"Do not waste your money purchasing this movie. Wait until it shows on TV, if you're unlucky enough to see it. The music for the story was inappropriate and totally threw off the entire story. Instead of following the story my husband and I kept concentrating on the terrible music. Dont waste your money"
dvd,5 of 7,5.0,One of the best!,"'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.  Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may.  I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.  Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original)  Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look.  Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill).  Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned.  The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.  One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.  This is the film to beat"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Friends: Season Six - More Divorces, A Proposal, Student Dating, The ''could've been"" and Unagi..... Great!","Wow, a lot of people do not like this season, but I really enjoyed it! This season had a lot of highlights for me. The Proposal at the end of the season was really great."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Effective -No Frills Ab Workout,I bought this exercise DVD three weeks ago and have been doing the beginner level ab workouts every other day. I like the fact that there are no commercials or introductions to fast forward through. The exercises are really short (10 minutes) so I can do this workout in addition to pilates or other strength training DVD's and get about an hour worth of aerobic activity; it's convenient. The workouts are also designed much better than what I would do on my own (crunch's and sit ups); there's a lot of variety to each workout-it doesn't get boring. Note: The advanced level workout's are bit jarring on the lower back- so work your way up.
dvd,1 of 2,4.0,Re:  Its a gas,"Another hilarious cube vision movie.  Mike Epps is one of the funniest guys on the planet and Cube's serious personna make for a classic goofy guy/straight guy combination.  Get some popcorn,  take a few deep breaths,  cause you will laugh.  Its a gas!!"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,A Wonderful Movie - One of Garner's Best,"Sally Field And James Garner star in this May-December romantic comedy. It's one of the funniest movies of all time, and has James Garner at his finest. He definitely makes the movie. Murphy's a widower, doesn't figure he can find another woman to love. Emma has been married to a good-time boy who was never there for her, or her son, unless he needed something. I love the age play in this movie. Emma's son (played by a young Corey Haim) gets a ride in Murphy's car and things he's driving too flow, then they pick up a man that is even older than Murphy and he wants out because he's driving too fast. The movie is full of those kinds of moments that just make you smile because it's funny that it is so true"
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,ER at it's finest,"The fourth season is one of the best.  This is ER when it was still ""pure"".... all of the Old Cast was still in place along with some new standouts. "
dvd,8 of 8,5.0,Is It Good?  Heck Yeah!,"Gungrave is an drama/fantasy anime set around the 1960's. Harry McDowell and Brandon Heat were just two young street punks, who stole things and fought other street gangs to survive in their turfs. Harry and Brandon, grew up in a orphange and have been best friends ever since. They were willing to do whatever it took to rise to the top and achieve freedom from their life of poverty and danger. Their chance came up when they met a top member of the most powerful mafia called, Millenion. Harry and his best friend Brandon, start off as errand boys, doing petty jobs inside the Millenion organization, but you'll see as they climb up the ladder and become, the mafia's top executives. You'll see as their ambitions and greed take over their actions for better or worse. "
dvd,,5.0,Absolutely Amazing!!!~,"  This movie is a complex journey into the minds of the Wachowski brothers and how they have got the knowhow to put trilogy depth into one single movie. They have this movie so multilayered, that half the movie, V is talking through the other characters and since the whole movie is one idea, it turns out to be possibly the most wholesome movie I've ever seen! From beginning to end, its poses many questions and lets you create the answers within your own mind. Everytime I watch this movie, I find something new and Natalie Portman plays the part perfect... puts me in tears. It takes a couple time of watching it for it really to kick in. Very well made flick. Amaaaaaazing!!!"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Indiscreet,"What Director Stanley Donen uses excellently here are two gorgeous, sophisticated stars that fit like a glove. He also creates a deliciously elegant atmosphere with colorful, chic sets and stunning Dior gowns that comprise a feast for the eyes.

I admit that the first time I watched it, I thought the beginning was a little slow as well.  But I watched it again and I paid more attention to it.  Sean Connery as Noah?  Sean Connery as Noah telling the animals with long ears to get in the ark and sit on the sides with their heads out because it will look ""f-ing excellent?""  "

dvd,2 of 3,5.0,"Creepy, thrilling, and frightening!","I watched this last night. For a new documentary filmmaker, John Borowski, is somebody to watch out for. This coumentary reminds you of old black and white thriller films but with great narration and commentary by Harold Schechter who wrote depraved about Dr. H. Holmes born Herman Mudgett. The criminal profiler reminds me of a blonde Chris Parnell and the forensics person is quite vague but explains the lack of forensics science during that time. Dr. H. Holmes was a frightening man who killed, slaughtered, dismembered humans and sold their skeletons for profit. He was truly a genius at manipulating poor men like Benjamin Pitezel and his family who were his greatest casualties. He was the first serial killer to become so notorious by the end of one century on par with England's Jack the Ripper"

dvd,9 of 9,5.0,Wonderful work!!,"After seeing ""The Visual Bible: Matthew"" which was absolutely fantastic mainly due to Bruce Marciano's outstanding performance,I had low expectations-boy, was I wrong!! "
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,What's better than a hot guy getting revenge?,"When I first saw this movie, I was surfing the limited channels on our television a week or so ahead of the time they would actually come on so that I could catch any that sounded promising. This was one of those. The description sounded good and a few of the actors' names sounded familiar, although I had never seen any of their movies to date. "
dvd,,5.0,Relax and Enjoy the Ride,"There are movies that inspire, movies that educate, movies that thrill an audience, movies that make us laigh etc.  Occassionally there comes along a movie that is pure fun; one that makes us enjoy every twist and turn, mixing laughter, endearment, and excitement.  ""Back to the Future"" is one such movie.  It is a well-scripted, well-acted, well-directed, well-filmed fun ""what if"" story of time travel.  "
dvd,1 of 6,5.0,To Anyone interested in Parenthood in The WideScreen Format,"I have it, Thanks to Turner Classic Movies, If you are interested"
dvd,25 of 25,5.0,A Great Set,"If you don't like classic comedy, you're not going to like this either.  But for me, this is my first stop when I need to take a break from the Marx Brothers (who I watch way too much).  These films are exhibit A for Bob Hope's comedic talents, and Bing's cooler than you or I will ever be.  Plus with Bing around, I'm actually happy to listen when the songs come, which is not the case for most 30's and 40's Hollywood films.  Morocco is my favorite, but any of these four films can brighten a dark day.  There are a few decent extras on this set, and for $20 it's a steal.  If you're willing to watch a comedy made before ""Animal House,"" you should go ahead and take the plunge into Hope and Crosby's world"
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,Gustavo,Excellent! I enjoyed it so much.... and will keep watching it over and over....
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,The Flying Nun made me a believer! :o),"Granted that peoples' viewing taste change as they mature, but I was sooooooooooo thrilled to see this finally come out on dvd.  I grew up watching this when I was a little kid, and like mostly everyone else who liked this show, I assumed I should be able to fly too (since I weighed only 70 pounds).  The love/hate relationship Sister Betrille has with Carlos Ramirez (Alejandro Rey) as she tries to find new ways to make him help the convent is hilarious.  Is it that the show is nostalgic that makes me like this show so much?  Perhaps...it reminds me of a time when the world was not quite so hectic, and yes...even a lil more innocent!  But then again maybe that is just me! :o"
dvd,,5.0,90's,"I was talking to someone recently about the most definitive movie of each decade. When it came to the nineties, we debated heavily whether or not the title should go to Shawshank Redemption or the Usual Suspects. I've probably watched 100's of movies from the 90's, but Usual Suspects is tops for that decade and puts a lot of more modern movies to shame"
dvd,1 of 5,1.0,Would've given it nil stars if I could've...,"Dated, derivative, self-indulgent & unintelligent.  This is truly bottom of the range stuff.  The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire.  None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully.  I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).  Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase. "
dvd,3 of 4,4.0,Dice players rejoyce,"I first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80's. I loved it then and still do today. Great story, great casting, great acting & great period film making. Diane Lane is not to shabby either as a strippin' diva with a taste for the fast life. Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this ""Gem Club"" of a movie. I sincerely hope we'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on DVD. Heck, I'd love to have a DVD with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it's not. I can always dream though.."
dvd,2 of 2,4.0,Thrilling!!!,"I have to start by saying I've never had such a physical reaction to a movie, like I had with this one!  As the film progressed, I found myself sweating profusely, my stomach in knots!  This is all due to the anticipation (or apprehention?) I felt waiting for Tom Ripley to be exposed as a fraud for impersonating his rich former-friend Dickie Greenleaf!  Just when you think Tom will finally fall flat on his face and be completely exposed as a criminal, he lands on his feet.  Either due to lots of luck or his own quick thinking! It's this anticipation/apprehension of waiting to see Ripley's ultimate humilation that had me in knots and sweating on pins and kneedles."
dvd,6 of 6,5.0,Wow!,"A pricey item, but Panik House has gone out of their way to provide value. Fans of Scorpion and Zero Woman (the old films - not the mostly-rubbish shot on video remakes) will be plenty satisfied with the selection. Loads of fun."
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,"Good season, poor DVD","I'm a great fan of The 4400 but I don't have patience enough to follow the schedule in the TV, therefore the DVD is the best choice to watch the episodes whenever I want. However,I like to have extra material in the media, like interviews and mainly subtitles (at least the English subtitle, because I'm not a native English speaker) and this DVD doesn't have it. Despite this lack of extra material, I recommend the purchase"
dvd,0 of 28,1.0,Couldn't wait for it to end,"I thought for sure I would enjoy this, but I found myself looking at the time and wondering when it would be over.  Stowe is good as are the others, but the story just did not engage me"

There are no major changes to the format or cast this year.  The only change is that the pair are now finding themselves in many more exotic locales than just L.A (2 out-of-town in San Fran and Vegas, and 6 out-of-country in Mexico, Malta, Ireland, and England).  "

dvd,1 of 6,1.0,sum of all stars? zero!,"Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled ""reapeat"".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor"
dvd,,5.0,one of my favorites,"This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our  bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings."

dvd,3 of 6,5.0,"5 stars, but not for this version!","I have to agree with the other reviews that mentioned a M.I.A ""Hearts of Darkness"". If you already own the original A.N. and Redux, then there is not much more to see. I would only buy this if it included ""Hearts"" and didn't have the annoying mulit-disk issue I was reading about. I'm holding out for the real ""complete dossier"".."
dvd,3 of 3,5.0,One of the best films ever made!,"Watching The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a surreal experience, one that you will not regret!!! A classic in every sense of the word. Furthermore, this DVD version is flawless, with 2 soundtrack options, and a host of special features. You can't go wrong."
dvd,5 of 10,5.0,Start Your 007 marathon here,James bond is a British agent that gets into all kinds of situations while saving the world from dastardly criminals that get more dastardly with each film. The 00 designation a means license to kill. Ad for a while there the devices used to kill where starting to outshine the stories. But no mater how exaggerated the Bond goodies were they stories did stick fairly close to the Ian Fleming stories. 
dvd,,5.0,A U2 Fan Must Own,"I've been a U2 fan since their early years. You'll read many philosophical reviews and in-depth disections here, but my point of view when it comes to music videos is that they should be, above all, entertaining. This video gives little glimpses into what inspired U2's music through that particular period. Bono & the boys are quite proud of their Irish roots, but humbly allowed many styles of American music to influence some of the best stuff they recorded through the 80's."
dvd,4 of 7,4.0,Not Enough Credit,"This is a fine quality horror film that doesn't get the honor it should.  This isn't just another monster in the woods chasing teenagers movie.  This is a tale of revenge, regret and retribution.  Good acting, lead by Lance Henrikson highlight this film, along with some incredibly creepy settings.  Special effects did a great job with Pumpkinhead himself.  If you are a fan of horror, go grab this one"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,Mail Order Bride - A Fun Movie with Great Music,"This film is a lot of fun; it's funny, well paced and features a terrific soundtrack of music by an extremely entertaining Russian rock 'n roll band called Red Elvises. The cast is also very likeable and talented, featuring, among others, Danny Aiello and Robert Capelli, Jr."
dvd,,5.0,"Hilarious, inspirational, funny - with a real depth & world-wide appeal!, ","This movie was superb. I wish it was available in PAL (not just US/Canada's NTSC format). I was both inspired not only with it's hysterical, insightful humour, but with it's global appeal. It brings out themes that EVERYBODY can relate to, not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families, but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes. The movie has great wit and side splitting humour. It's such fun to watch and this man is a star!"
dvd,2 of 3,5.0,Such a Treasure!!!,"The French Chef....Julia Child....will forever be a national treasure.  Thankfully, technology has made it possible for Ms. Child to teach for generations to come. "
dvd,9 of 12,5.0,Thank you thank you thank you,"Thank you for finally releasing the 3rd part of this great series. On this DVD is the only surviving footage of blues harmonica genius Little Walter, which was until now only available on bootleg videos. Unfortunately, the DVD continues the tradition of the first two dvds in the series in showing the original broadcasts in an edited and out-of-order format. Maybe one day they will release a boxed set of the video footage in the proper original order with the original introductions intact. Still, despite the drawbacks to the edited footage, it is better than not having it available. The footage itself gets 5 stars"
dvd,3 of 6,1.0,what a sad world we live in.," They say that art reflects society and it is no wonder that Bush is president and the whole world has gone mad killing each other over religion when movies like Two Days are made.  The film is the worst i have ever seen by far, a motiveless paul rudd who gives a terrible performance tries to convince us that he wants to kill himself cause he cant get work as an actor in sunny LA and afford a BMW, this in itself is a flawed idea but trust me when i tell you it sinks lower than dolly partons [...] as the story, or lack there off, unfolds.  No real characters, just cliche's, absolutely no direction whatsoever, nothing is achieved visually just a bunch of talking heads that fail to convince us of anything else except what fools we were for watching this film.  By the end of it i wanted to kill myself in couldnt wait two days!!! Who made this film????"
dvd,2 of 21,2.0,A disappointment in a way...,"For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,NO DVD?!!,"HBO Better get the act together and come up with a dvd real soon, i'm not impressed with them at all. Well enough of that now, great film and Kelsey Grammer and company did a fine job here. So get the movie. DON'T WASTE YOU TIME TRYING TO FIND IT ON DVD"

dvd,1 of 1,5.0,gets better and better,"First, I truely believe this movie has very little to do with comic books except as a metaphor for self-discovery.  Second, this is probably the best movie I have ever seen that deals with a man's loss sense of self (AKA mid-life crisis).  Here's our reluctant hero on the verge of a divorce, detached from everything around him (even his son)while stumbling through his life on a daily basis.  He tries to juice up his life a bit early on in the movie in a failed pick up attempt on the train he will untimately be the lone survivor of."
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,High school nostalgia,"This is perhaps the greatest National Lampoon movie ever.  Or, at the very least, it's tied with VAN WILDER and the original VACATION.  NL has made a few lame movies, but this one is one of the most worthwhile."

But apparently I've been living under a rock since I've recently just discovered Veronica Mars -- one of the best shows on TV that people aren't watching.  I'm a huge Gilmore Girls fans, but I must say that I think Veronica Mars is right up there or even surpasses GG in it's witty, sassy dialogue.  Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring, who play Veronica Mars and Logan Echolls, sizzle onscreen and are such a kick to watch.  The mysteries that they layer on in both seasons are enough to keep you addicted & will have you finishing the DVDs within only a couple days!"

dvd,1 of 6,2.0,Too dry and boring,I have to go against the grain here and give a Thumbs Down to this series.  The things that come out about the characters is simply not very interesting.  The things that they say aren't interesting.  Their lives aren't made interesting for us.

dvd,11 of 13,5.0, One of my All Time Favorites ,"This film made a very deep impression on me as, although I'm originally from Canada, I always introduce myself as ""from New York"" when I visit Europe, and I have experienced the same kind of anti-Americanism that is lampooned in this film.  Also, for about 13 years (before I got married), I made numerous trips to Europe, met lots and lots of European women, and had some of the same  experiences with them as the characters in this film: Two American cousins (Fred, a naval officer, and Ted, a Christian Sales Exec) who are sharing an apartment in Barcelona, while searching for members of the opposite sex. "
dvd,2 of 3,4.0,Hillary,Much has been written about the miscasting of John Travolta as Bill Clinton in this movie.  Not much has been written about Emma Thompson's casting.
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,"Life goes by fast.If you don't stop and look at it,it could pass you by.","One of John Hughes best films,Ferris Bueler made me laugh harder than any other Hughes film. The though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were him.I love this film"
dvd,10 of 11,2.0,"""I'd put her in boiling oil and watch her fry.""","It's amazing what you can get away with even when you have censors breathing down your neck. With the Hays Code of film censorship enforced in 1934, a number of films were made which appeared to be moral crusades. In reality, these films gave an excuse for a titillating glimpse at some lurid element. It was also important, in these 'moral crusade' films to include moral statements--usually at the beginning of the film--making it clear that the film is some sort of attempt to expose a wicked social ill, and educate the public about it at the same time. These moral crusade films include such titles as ""Cocaine Fiends"" and the well-known ""Reefer Madness."" ""Child Bride"" (alternate title: ""Child Bride of the Ozarks"")--made in 1938 falls into the same category. In this case, however, the social ill is supposed to be limited geographically to those regions in America that allowed early marriage.  "
dvd,6 of 6,4.0,Still Holds Up....,"This is no NEW movie, with fancy CG or big name stars...but the one liners and attitude are enough to make this movie a classic for the ages.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's a guys flick through and through.  So, order up some Pizza...invite a few buddies over and enjoy.  The fight scene in the middle of the movie is one of the greatest fist fights you will ever see in cinema!!!  Best be ready to be entertained...this movie should have been more than just a great cult hit"
dvd,14 of 33,5.0,Another overpriced boxset.,"I'm sure that this anime show is topnotch. I'm sure it kicks ass. However, why in god's name are they selling it for almost $150? Because you are willing to pay for it. Do the sell Harvey Birdman or Venture Bros for this much? No, because nobody is stupid enough to pay for it. While it is a good show, I would reccomend refraining from buying it until they cut the price down (simmilar to Neon Genesis, cowoby Bebop, Trigun, and every other 7 year old, 24 episode anime they want to sell to you for $100). "
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Sting at his best,This DVD is a must for any Sting fan. It gives fans the most revealing view of the singer I have ever seen. The keen insight from Brandford Marsalis was a delight to see and everyone seemed to put their all into the project. I'm proud to finally have it on DVD
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,On the Edge of Perfection,"Okay, let's get it said and out of the way: ""The Searchers"" is one of the greatest films ever made. There, it's done. We can move on now. It can be hard to view, and harder still to write about, a film with such reputation for greatness and such a deep background of commentary as John Ford's 1956 classic. The film holds great cultural weight and a completely objective approach to the film is, for most, impossible. It is the most quintessential film of the most quintessential American genre, and its themes and characters take on infinite meaning towards the country and people they represent. It is perhaps the richest western ever produced in both scale and content. And yet ""The Searchers"" is really two films in one, and while many like to conveniently ignore its failures, they still fall from the screen cold and lifeless whenever viewed. The film is great because of its challenge to the commonly held notions of history, both cinematic and actual, that have produced it, and yet it still gets caught up in the pitfalls it at other moments so brilliantly rejects. For as much as we would like it to not be, ""The Searchers"" is still a studio film of Old Hollywood, and a western to boot, and despite it undisputable greatness, at times in the film this is painfully evident."
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition),"Yep, still one of the funniest movies ever made. We quoted it profusely back in college, now my 5th, 7th, and 9th graders quote it. I guess kids are more advanced these days. Niih"
dvd,,5.0,one of the best sesame street videos,"this one is my son's favorite. he's almost 2, and this one grabs his attention the most. i think this is one of the top videos if you are going to get just one or 2 of them. its not very educational, but filled with songs and different clips. i have noticed that a lot of the sesame streets will have some of the same clips, and this one has the classic clips like c is for cookie and oscar's trash song. i like this elmo because it has a lot of culture in it. it is from the 90's so has that bright colored clothing and hip hop style.  its also longer than a lot of the other videos. the end is my favorite with the african singers singing the carpenters ""sing a song"" song. "

dvd,6 of 8,2.0,Disappointing,"I found this movie was disappointing and the acting amateurish.  The nude scenes were scarce and brief (unlike the hype)and I'm someone who believes that good full-frontal nudism will salvage any dog.  But this old dog just don't hunt.  If you can't resist the hype, rent don't buy. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,My daughter and I love it!,"I grew up with the other Annie movie and loved it, but when I went to buy the movie for my daughter, I thought I'd also give this new version a chance.  I love it!  And I feel it's paced better for my daughter, and she found it much more fun.  I normally like to stick to classics and frown upon remakes, but now I realize some things are done better the second time around.  The acting, singing, and script are great.  Give this a chance-- for ten bucks you won't regret it!"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,Epic movie that gets better year after year,They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  
dvd,8 of 12,5.0,Extraordinary Account of the History of the Universe,This DVD provides a scientifically objective account of the origin and development of the universe from its first fractional second of existence to (almost) the present.  The uncanny correspondence of this factual account with all the Judeo-Christian biblical creation references certainly provoked further study in our house!  Highly recommended
dvd,4 of 5,5.0,Glad I Bought It,I would recommend the video set to anyone playing golf (from beginner to experienced).  A real value
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Flawless,"I was hesitant to start collecting Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex because I had watched the first 8 episodes and was not totally convinced to buy it. Well, I collapsed and gave in after seeing the episodes on this disc. The show never ceases to amaze me at how intelligent it is and in the writing. This is quite possibly the best series of anything, ever. And this disc proves it"
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Powerful Courtroom Drama that Still Resonates," The military courtroom drama,""A Few Good Men"" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's ""never even seen the inside of a courtroom"". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a ""Code Red"" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the ""Code Red"", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as ""code, honor & discipline"". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not ""handle the truth""? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous ""You Can't Handle the Truth"" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend ""A Few Good Men"""
dvd,2 of 5,4.0,Tedious beauty,"I first saw this film in 1965 or 1966 at the Ann Arbor Cinema Guild.  I didn't ""get it,"" but the memory of certain scenes stuck with me -- so when it became available on video decades later, I bought it.  Especially memorable scenes involve chasing a dog late at night through deserted streets, a halyard clanking against a metal flagpole, a flight in a small airplane, and hanging out at the airport in Rome.  All the human relationships in this film are problematic.  A lot of people, will find this film hopelessly affected, needlessly tedious.  But it's far from being Antonioni's worst movie: Zabriski Point wins that one by a kilometer."
dvd,,5.0,"Wow!  Don't read about the movie, just go watch it...","Often in my reviews, I touch on elements of the plot.  I wouldn't call them ""spoilers"" per se, but I went in to this movie almost cold, and that turned out to be an immensely rewarding experience!  Harakiri rewards patience.  I was actually bored for the first 30 minutes of the film, and then it all comes together.  Somewhat light on action, this film is an articulate criticism of the corruption power brings and the length one man goes to expose the hypocrisy. "
dvd,1 of 1,5.0,A Masterpiece...,"I taped this off the air when it was first broadcast, then bought the LD's when they came out.  Seeing that a DVD release is not likely, I treasure them-a wonderful documentary"
dvd,4 of 4,5.0,The superb Gretchen Mol.,"Given that Bettie Page is a relatively minor figure in world history, unlike other reviewers I felt no need to fact check this film, nor did I mind that Gretchen Mol looks more like Rebecca De Mornay than Bettie Page.  Please, folks, wait for Ken Burns' 18-hour History Of Bondage for this level of detail."
dvd,,5.0,Great Concert Footage and Music,"Haven't seen this since it was in the theaters almost 20 years ago. This is an excellent concert DVD. The documentary footage is the usual rockumentary stuff, going to Graceland and seeing Elvis's grave and talking deeply about the meaning of the music (which the band actually mocks and laughs about doing). But the music and seeing U2 in their prime as this monolithic juggernaut of musical talent, charisma and stage performance is just magical. The music is great and Bono is the air apparent to the thrown of Savior of Rock and Roll. He is THE MAN. One highlight that was not actual concert footage is them working with B.B. King. Also love the beginning, ""Charles Manson stole this song from the Beatles... we're stealin' it back,"" as an intro for Helter Skelter. The first half is in black and white for all the new songs that they were introducing. Then when they get to most of their big hits in the second half it is in color"
dvd,,5.0,Just as good,Season Three keeps up the breakneck pace of the previous two.  My only criticism would be that there was no continuity with Kate Warner.  It was left very unclear why that relationship did not continue.  The return of Nina Myers was an added bonus.  It's fiction - kick back and enjoy.
dvd,4 of 4,4.0,Second servin's,"I see alot of low ratings and don't know why. This is a documentary on beef in the industry as a whole, not just today's petty ass squabbles. Beef2 takes you on the same trip as the first one. Showing you there is no such thing as loyalty when it comes down to paper. It also shows you the outcome of a battle is not decided on whose the nicest on the mic. Krs's loss to Nelly proved that. The Roxanne phenom was also incredible, how one young woman's appearance and a single verse sparked dozen's of responses from some of the best artist ever. What kept me from giving this a 5 was the part of the pimpin'. I really didn't see the importantance of that. Or the D-12 and Royce beef. I'm not sayin there nobody's but there is much more established artist with real beef that derserved that screen time(Mc Eiht vs. DJ Quik,Nas vs. Cameron, Jay-Z vs. Jaz-O, Foxy Brown vs. Lil'Kim) just to name a few. Overall this was a good installment, I hope it's not the last one. "
dvd,1 of 3,5.0,A Child's Paradise,"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is one of those rare films that bridges the child-adult film gap.  Persons of all ages can watch, eyes wide, and revel in Willy Wonka's eccentricities and Charlie's inate goodness and splendid luck.  The film, more than 30 years old, hardly feels its age.  Made in a time before computerized special effects, the relative cheese quotient only serves to make the film that much more charming."
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,worth the buy,"Naruto is one of the best anime of it's time. this collection comes with both english and dubbed versions of the series, I started with watching the dubbed years ago but I still love the english version of this show that is how well Viz did on converting the show and with this set the English version is fully uncut all the blood and sexual themes are still intact and now has the orignal openings from the Jap version not that crappy one from cartoon network the bonus features are great too and the sketch book was interesting to look at but I would have prefered a Manga but oh well maybe next set which I am anticipating greatly.  I have been watching this series for years in dubbed form and I am still in love with it till this day Dubbed or English it is all good so I highly suggest this set for any vet of the show and anyone who has never seen Naruto definetly needs to pick this up it's worth it.  "
dvd,2 of 5,5.0,Great Trilogy and Special features,"Everyone knows the first Jurassic Park movie rocked.  The Lost World was just as good, but it was more of the same: thrilling dinosaurs and chases scenes with dinosaurs that look completely real.  The third Jurassic Park movie was not quite as good, but still a great movie.  It had all the ingredients and I really enjoyed all three"
dvd,2 of 2,5.0,Great Live Show,U2 fans will never forget the phenomenon that was known as Zoo TV. Zoo TV was a massively produced world tour that took rock band U2 all over the world. Long time fans may remember that they performed at the MTV Music Video Awards with Dana Carvey via satellite during the MTV Video Music Awards. The tour was in support of the groups 1991 album Achtung Baby.
dvd,1 of 6,5.0,One of my favorite,"I haven't owned this one yet so everytime it's on tv I was so happy I had a chance to review it again. And it never disppoint me---I was always moved strongly even though I've seen it three times and now it's the fourth time. I never spent my life as this style of the people in this movie, but it's never a problem. I think Meg Tilly is a very good actor. About the great speech of a big star of director--I think it's ok or funny, just it's also abrupt putting this part in this movie"
dvd,3 of 3,4.0,Phenomenal,"""Never Get Outta The Boat"" is probably the best film on drug/alcohol addiction I have seen to date.  It certainly transcends ""Requiem For A Dream"", which I found neither shocking nor moving, and has something that ""Traffic"" lacks entirely.  "
dvd,2 of 4,5.0,"Revitalized, Funny Woody. Not the best, but great fun.","`Bullets Over Broadway' by Woody Allen proves that one of Allen's strengths as a writer is in conceiving of implausible premises such as `Zelig', `Purple Rose of Cairo', and this movie and making them seem very real, and in building some very big jokes out of the situation. I believe this is the first movie done after the very messy breakup with Mia Farrow and the scandal with their young adopted daughter. This coincides with a change in studio with the move to Miramax and a relatively fresh crop of actors. While Allen's work seems much fresher after the somewhat weak `Shadows and Fog', there seems to be no inhibitions from the Weinsteins of Miramax on Allen's style. Aside from an executive producer added to the masthead, joining Rollins and Joffre, there is little change in Allen's senior creative team and the movie seems to be as fresh or fresher than Allen has been for a while."
dvd,,4.0,Awesome!!,i am a huge fan of this show i have been since this show first started. I have seen every single episode. This season was one of my favorites it had a lot of good episodes that address controversial problems teens face today like pride and accidents will happen. However i was very anxious to see accidents will happen for the first time. Once i saw it i was kindof disappointed.  I really dont know why they had such a problem with showing this episode in the u.s. It was just a regular episode manny gets pregnant and everyone finds out. I have seen many episodes from different shows and movies  like this episode so i dont think it was anything special. But i strongly encourage to buy this season there are plenty of awesome episodes
dvd,65 of 68,5.0,"Black history , beautifully told!","This documentary does what so many others on Black Music failed to do, it  discusses the music in the context of black struggle in America.  The reason this DVD was such a breath of fresh air to me is because I purchased it after returning a documentary (American Roots Music) that did the exact opposite.  Where American Roots Music teases the viewer with one or two seconds of it's &quot;rare footage&quot;, Blues Masters shows rare sessions with Son House, Leadbelly, Bessie Smith and many more virtually uncut.  Where American Roots Music attempts to handle the music as if it exists in a vacuum; Blues Masters doesn't separate the music from the people who created it. The latter even makes mention and shows footage of self-determined Black leaders such as Marcus Garvey  and Father Divine, who both were very influential among common Black folks of the time. It discusses the &quot;Racist Regime of America&quot; and it's deep mistreatment of Blacks and alludes to the fact that this deep seated oppression and pain had to be an element of what actually drove Black folks to create the blues in the first place. This DVD is a must have. Buy two copies, just in case one of your friends decide to borrow it and never give it back"
dvd,1 of 23,1.0,Waste of Time and Money,"Awful. Only made it through 2 episodes. Definately British so-called ""humor"". Would not make my enemies watch this. This sounds like a harsh review, but this was the kindest way I could put it"
dvd,4 of 6,4.0,Thank God It's Friday!,"Friday After Next has shattered the myth that all sequels are doomed to be worse than their predecessors.  While I hope this is the last in the Friday series, it will have you howling as much as with the first one.  Ice Cube is a natural in his role as Craig, a young man growing into his own while trying to navigate the wilderness of a Los Angeles `hood unscathed.  If you've never seen any of the prequels, rent Friday - the one that jumped it all off.  I can guarantee you'll want to add all of them to your DVD collection ASAP!"

dvd,2 of 4,5.0,Very Good Flick. One Of Van Damme's Best!,"One of Van Damme's best films, quite similar to the best film to Van Damme's name 'BloodSport'. The Quest was enjoyable and suspenseful. Great fight scenes, very cool final fight. I would recommend buying this film on DVD"
dvd,3 of 4,5.0,What a Great Film!,"I first encountered Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Donnie Darko"" a couple of years ago, and was blown away by his natural style of acting and easy likeability. I have both versions of that film, and go back to them often. More recently, I saw Gyllenhaall in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" was again amazed at his warmth and humanity onscreen. I decided to try this earlier film and absolutely love it. As a family-oriented movie, parts are a little bit predictable, but you really root for the kids and their dream of building a rocket. For this generation's attitude of instant gratification, this is an inspiring story of how persistence and hard work can really pay off. For those of us of a more mature nature, it's still and inspiration and a joy to watch. Meeting the men the story was based on was also a treat, as was the information about what became of all of the main characters. A great movie"
