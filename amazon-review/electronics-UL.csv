electronics,16 of 16,4.0,"Good product, but here are some warnings","All-in-all a fine product, rather than add to the marketing reviews, here are a couple of points not well communicated."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,How to get it working again!,"True, this little guy freezes from time to time when you forget to dismount it properly (NOT creatives fault!). It's pretty easy to reformat if you people who say it's 'broken' used LINUX and not windows! Simple as that guys - no need to bother with with wasting your money on repair costs. Unbelievable."
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Expensive!!! But a damn good stereo!,"Okay... so the price tag is a little hefty but this stereo unit is definately worthwhile. I decided to go with the Hi-Fi because it sounds great, it charges your Ipod and it also offers an AUDIO IN plug-in so you can hook it up to your computer and use it when watching your DVD's or playing video games. This is not available with the other competing units which provide an AUDIO OUT plug-in... this is stupid. Why would I want to add more speakers to another speaker? Anyways..."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,HP Premium Plus Photo Paper - Excellent,"Although a bit more expensive than desired, HP Premium Plus Photo Paper gives very good results especially when using HP printers (I use HP photosmart7760). The special coating on the back to prevent sticking is also a very good innovation."
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,Just Super,I bought this 1GB card for my Palm Zire 31 Handheld mainly for storing and carrying around music (with the convenience of an organizer) for my rehearsals. The card works flawlessly and the write and read speed is absolutely amazing. PalmOne's documentation gives the impression that only PalmOne's cards will work on their PDAs and does not document that any other SD or MMC card would work. But I took a chance with this 1GB card and I saved big time as PalmOne's 512 MB card with way lower write speeds (not even specified by their specs) sells for $99. I got this card for $89.
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Nearly perfect.,"I've used Lexar cards for quite a while, and they have always worked great. The SD cards (interchangeable with MMCs) are inherently fast (writing time to the card can slow your camera), are excellent misers of battery power and have a distinctive cost advantage over most other brands. You really cannot go wrong with Lexar"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,It works.,"Everybody keeps complaining about the sensitivity of this radio.  I am not in the boonies, I am in the city and the tuner picked up all of the radio stations and tv stations that I would be interested in listening to during an ememergency.  Others have also complained about the fragile nature of it's construction.  I didn't buy it to use on a regular basis.  I bought it to be used when the electricity is out and I want to stay informed.  I hope I never need it, but I probably will and I expect it will serve it's purpose at that time"
electronics,,5.0,BCI-15 Ink Cartridge,High quality photo prints.  Can't tell the difference between my prints and processed print
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works very nice!,"This is a very nice microphone. It really improves the quality of the sound especially when you don't want to show your recorder, you just plug in the microphone, put the recorder in your bag and just let the microphone outside to do its job. It comes with a clip that you can use for example to put the recorder in your pocket and attach the microphone to your shirt"
electronics,1 of 20,2.0,do you ship in Italy?,i wont know il you ship two headset for motorola talkabau
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,"awesome, awesome, awesome",it has a powerful bass very comfortable in the ear and has a perfect cord length. i cannot complain with this at all. it is like buying one of the best at a cheap pric
electronics,,1.0,Wide Multi-Color Page Streaks  Render Printer USELESS.,Printer has had very light use and suddenly developed mostly magenta & cyan toner leaks. The excess toner is streaked and transfered to every page resulting in full length page striping. The print outs are absolutely useless for presentation and barely useable for drafts. HP denies there is a problem however I see that I am not the only one with this issue. Won't buy HP again. This is clearly a defective product design. There is no resolve. Your printer is now an expensive and rather large doorstop. 
electronics,,5.0,::Love::,"I normally don't write reviews for things, but since the previous reviews gave me a somewhat jaded view towards these headphones before I bought them (yeah, I bought them anyways) I decided my imput would be helpful."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works with Dell Inspiron 5100,It was so easy to install and worked perfectly the first time I turned my computer on.  I'm going to get another card and upgrade to the full 1 Gb capacity of my laptop
electronics,,5.0,Transpod for the IPod,"I read a very favorable review of the Transpod in ""MacAddict"" (a 'zine for Macintosh users). My experience with the Transpod agrees with this review. I have found the Transpod works well. I strongly recommend it!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Phone tools 4.0 made my cool phone even cooler,Well the first thing I did was make sure my phone was supported by the program(in my case V3c)Once I saw that it was I ordered it up and in 5 days it was in my mail box!!!I couldn't be happier with the ringtone maker!!!You can take any part of a song or wav file and make it into ringtone...NO MORE PAYING RINGSTER EVER!!!!!On top of it all the price is more than right because my local phone place is selling the same product for $30.Over all if your phone is supported GET THIS PRODUCT!!!
electronics,3 of 6,5.0,Don't listen to the hardcore gamer lol,I game heavily with this mouse.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good for traffic control.,"I work a side job directing traffic near a busy Texas highway.  Without this, I had a hard time hearing the other officers on my Talkabout.  Using the earbud makes things MUCH easier and I can concentrate on the cars and not the radio."
electronics,,5.0,APC notebook power surge,This surge protector is really small and handy. . . it even fits the casing for the power supply in my notebook bag.  i take it with me everywhere i go and it has worked well for me.  it has given me a sense of security that my vaio is protected for electrical surges at all times
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Low Pitch Hum Unbearable,"I have two major beefs with my unit, which I've had for about 7 months:"
electronics,,5.0,Great Keyboard!,This has been a great keyboard. It is silent and the keys have a firm feel when I press them. The keys' profiles are flatter than the Apple keyboards and that makes it easier to move from one key to the next.
electronics,,5.0,Not bad for a flash drive...,I needed some extra space on a flash and this really made my traveling a lot easier.
electronics,,1.0,D-Link is garbage,This piece of junk died after less than a year in service.  I have a Linksys access point that has been running for over 3 years now.  I'm on my way to get another one of those to replace this inferior D-Link product.  Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere
electronics,14 of 14,4.0,"Great headphones, minor limitations","UPDATED - I've been looking forward to these headphones for quite a while. The sound of them is, in my opinion, great. Granted, I am not an Audiophile, but to me, the sound is very good. My main reason, for getting these is because I frequently wander about my apartment listening to audiobooks. I wanted a way to leave my iPod in one position and wander without worrying. These headphones are perfect for that. With a range approaching 30 feet (don't believe the published full range, you'll never be happy if you think you can reliably get 30 feet from the source) I can leave my iPod in the middle of my apartment and go anywhere in my apartment without issue. "
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,Avoid this product,I don't see why I need to download an application to remove the U3 utility. It's totally unneeded. Also the drive lasted a total of 2 months. In those 2 months I used it about 10 times. The slider also is sticky and becomes difficult retract and close. I would avoid it.
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,iriver t10,"I use this primarily for voice recording school lectures. The recording quality is better than the creative recorder I first bought.  It's not as easy to use as the creative. Online and telephone support is excellent. Battery life seems short, but I have nothing to compare it to.   I would definitely recommend this for voice recording"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Your gonna need one of these,"I just got an iPod the other day, and while I love it, it is rather fragile and needs protection. This case not only looks good, but it covers your entire iPod. This was the best $25.00 I could have spent on keeping my iPod safe"
electronics,,5.0,Good Gift,I got this stuff as a gift for a friend of mine. He seems to be happy using it. So I am giving this a 5 star
electronics,,5.0,These batteries are great!,I would certainly recommend these Sony rechargeable batteries! My boyfriend bought me a set with the charger shortly after purchasing my Canon PowerShot A620 (which I also love!!) and I am now back to buy an extra set b/c we are going on vacation. They last a long time and re-charge in no time at all.
electronics,,1.0,The Controller universally sucks,Problem one is you need to push the buttons hard.  The controller also wears out quickly.  The next thing is it won't hold a code for more than a few minutes.  I am constantly typing in 1002 for my Sony tv.  RCA sucks.  Directv shouldn't allow RCA to make products for them.  I have three of these pieces of junk
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Awesome Cable,"First off, the cable is 6 feet long.  For some reason this isn't in the product description, so there it is.  Anyway, having said that, I can say with 100% certainty that this cable is every bit as good as my much, MUCH more expensive Monster Toslink cable.  I got this cable to replace the optical one because I'm switching soundcards on my computer and the new one doesn't have optical output.  Anyway, I tested them side by side and I couldn't tell a difference.  I'm already using Monster speaker cable which does make a HUGE difference over the junky cable that came with my Logitech Z-680's.  Anyway, I could tell no difference whatsoever switching between the two.  The only real difference is the price.  I paid more than ten times as much for the Monster Toslink cable.  So, if you're debating whether to go with this or something more expensive my reccomendation is to go with this cable.  It'll save you a lot of money and you'll get the exact same performance."
electronics,8 of 9,4.0,Ideazon Everquest II Keyset for Zboard Keyboard,"This is my 1st review, so let this alone tell you that this item is worth buying.  Now, I came from EQ1 to EQ2 like most people did, but between the years of eq1 and eq2 a lot in my life has changed.  For example, I no longer have endless hours to purge on online gaming."
electronics,,1.0,trouble from the start,"From the beginning I had connection issues with the hardware and software - my system hanging on me for no good reason.  On a couple of occasions I had to reformat the player, but found that even that was difficult to do (worked on WinXP but not on Win2k).  Maybe used it 10-15 times total over the past year because it's been so difficult."
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Nice until it broke,"Used it for 2 weeks and then the on/off switch no longer turned the mouse on.  I had registered it with iogear and contacted them to complain.  They asked me to return it and then sent me a refurbished on that didn't work at all.  Seemed like a good mouse and the price was right, but 0 for 2 has made me give the Kensington version a try"
electronics,26 of 26,1.0,Be an educated consumer!  You don't have to spend a lot for *digital* cables,"You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals.  Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel?  There's no gold inside!  So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables.   If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie.  Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference."
electronics,3 of 4,2.0,My Amp bites the dust.!,I have to add to the reviews on the amps in these failing. I purchased my Promedia speaker system through Dell on 10/04. Recently the sound quit working. I finally got Dell to send out
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Scratched my iPod,"I currently have the 60 GB video iPod, and at first this product was working great for me. I did try to run with it but my iPod was to big, and the band didn't support it much so it wobbled a lot. The cover is what I am particularly upset about. The cover scratched my iPod up pretty bad from continuously taking it out and putting it back in to charge or update my iPod. I know it is the cover that scratched it, because I always keep my iPod in the cover and I also keep it in the iSnug protective case (the one that is zipped up and has an extra netted compartment for the buds.)  I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I am currently looking for a new case to put my iPod in that has an opening at the bottom so I don't have to take my iPod out to charge it"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,What everyone needs,The product did not require as much effort as others I have used before.  The radio runs for better then 20 mins. with just a half minute of cranking and the fine tune adjustment is a big help also.  The Grundig FR200 is perfect for the outdoors person and/or those who deal with power outages
electronics,,5.0,Excellent see throu !!,"My opinion on web cam got changed with this creative web cam. The picture clarity is excellent and the aduio quality is simply supurb. Making long line short, i canot imagine my chat (with family members  in INDIA from USA) without this webcam."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,0 stars:  AVOID like the plague,"Would you play Russian Roulette?  No, of course not.  Then why would you do so with your media??  That's what you'll be doing if you waste your money on this ""media"".  The only worse ""media"" is hocked under the linkyo label"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Great Product!,I love this phone! One thing you have to decide before purchasing this is what you'll use it for. This is not a replacement for your cell phone. Look at it more as a cordless phone. 
electronics,,5.0,Works great,"I did my first install of this wireless desktop this past weekend and everything went smoothly.  I love that you can opt to use the existing PS/2 connections, leaving another USB port open."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Not a GREAT Mic,"This mic was great, for the short time it worked. I only had it for about 2 weeks or so before it quit working. I was glad I had only paid about $4 for it"
electronics,,2.0,disappointed,"this looked like it would be a great addition to my laptop, but they were a disappointment...the volume just wasnt' there for what I neede"
electronics,27 of 31,2.0,"Sounds great, CD player dies","Great appearance and sound, JVC has produced a nice sounding unit.  Speakers look as great as they sound, no problem handling bass at loud levels.  Tuner is very easy to use, USB input works flawlessly.  Now the bad news, the CD mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any CD, whether store bought or MP3 burned.  First unit died after three weeks, the replacement lasted five.  CD player mechanical design is unable to handle light use.  Will think twice about buying a JVC again.."
electronics,,5.0,Great!Excellent!,"This bag is fantastic,comfortable to carry, fits loads in,protects my laptop,doubles as hand luggage.No complaints at all. Best bag I've ever bought"
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Great Scanner!!,"I just love this scanner. Not only does it work well for documents as well as slides and negatives, it has a very small footprint on the desk and looks so Slick!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,This item does not work with Mac OSX 10.4.X,"I bought the item noticing they had support for Mac 10.3+ which should include 10.4.8 since it is greater than 10.3 right ? :)  After having issues getting it to work on OSX, I called up tech support.  Sadly, it is not supported nor does it work with 10.4.X. "
electronics,4 of 7,5.0,Very Nice!!!!!,"The iPod photo Dock is a nice home base for charging your iPod, hooking your iPod to your computer, for connecting your iPod to your stereo or for hooking it to your TV to view Photo's. It is very convenient and easy to use; all you need is the right cable to connect it to your stereo (TV, computer-it especially comes in handy if your USB connection is in the back of your computer.), You can get Monster iTV Link cable that provides both S-video and audio. Its a nice place to set your iPod (and do all the above) when your home and I would recomend this product"
electronics,,5.0,Wonderful 'phones,No complaints. At all.
electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Poor and useless support. Does not record images,"I've made the biggest mistake of buying 6 of these cameras only to find out that the images does not get recorded at all. I called the technical support of D-Link and all they did was make me repeat the trouble 4 times and promise me to pass me to level 2 support and then they'd drop the line. If I call back, I had to go through the same routine all over again. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT or you will be as sorry as I am now"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Wow - They Burn Great!,"I've gone through nearly half a deck of 50 in a couple of days so far, and they are flawless.  No coasters!  No pixelation or jumping footage!  Spend a bit more, but go for the Verbatim DVD+R"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works great,"Good construction, right size (buttons are big enough to use) and sounds great.  Replaced a high-end office-type cordless and this phone is better than the last set (Siemens)."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Excellent GPS,"I bought the Garmin ETREX gps (yellow)and am very happy with it. In fact I went back to Amazon and bought two more, one for the wife and one for our son. It does everything it says it will do and more. Also very pleased with Amazon and the ordering,and handling. I have started to buy all my products through Amazon whan available"
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,As Advertised,Product was easy to set up and use. Loading the program was easy and without error. Map detail was above average and after setting a route I intentionaly turned at tye wrong places and each time the program corrected itself and gave me new directions to the original destination. Would recommend this GPS ta anyone
electronics,5 of 17,1.0,Big problems with Panasonic.com, It seems Panasonic has become like other Corporations in that the customer is treated like the enemy.  Panasonic.com doesn't return any emails or calls and even customer service has ignored all of my emails.  I sure hope the recorder doesn't break because there is no way I'd expect any help from Panasonic.  
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,get 'em NOW!!!,"These are great for road trips, T.V., and other stuff. whaen i was getting them i wanted to know how big the transmitter is. it's small. it comes with a plastic thing so the transmitter dosen't hang; wich is the only time when the quality is not so good. it also comes with a elastick/velcro band to keep it from hanging. the charger has a V spliter so you can charg the headphones & the transmitter at the same time. this all fits in a carrying pack that comes with it. at full charg it lasts the same as my ipod. the ears are not to big. Im a kid and they fit me. theses are aswome "
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,not so hot,I bought this unit from the Verizon store to pair with my Motorola E815. Sound quality wasn't too bad but there were some very annoying traits which caused me to return the product.
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,THis is such a bad product.,I just receive this radio today. Yet it is totally useless. I cant hear anything from this poor radio. It just keeps scaning and repeats over and over. It does not receive any station at all. It is even worse than my $3 mini radio bought in walgreen. What s bad radio. Avoid this item.
electronics,,5.0,Awesome!,These speakers pump!  They sound great and can be used for almost anything since they accept multiple input sources.  The subwoofer is HUGE though.  Make sure you have space for it
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,iHome clock radio,My son is very satisfied with his iHome clock radio for his ipod
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,I am very pleased with this mouse.,I have been using this mouse for around a week now and so far I love it.  I have found the precision is very good which makes it easy to navigate with.  The design is very comfortable and I can actually move the mouse easily without constantly hitting the 3rd and 4th buttons.  Overall I highly recommend this mouse
electronics,,2.0,Good player but  very poor construction,"My player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).  "
electronics,23 of 23,5.0,Super Fast SD memory,This is the fastest SD memory I tried. 
electronics,0 of 10,5.0,Hey?,"Does any one know if you can have 3 hours of converted of movies,100 pictures,and 10-20 song all together.or like just 3 hours of converted of movies at one time.thats al"
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,"Map updates, customer service  HAHAHAHA","The maps are old, an customer service is clueless. The website is worthless also. The product works, but the old information constantly makes you travel out of the way before you get to your location. I for one will try another brand"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Great Product. Never Had Battery Probs ... Maybe because ....,"I read the directions before I began using it. I've had it for nearly three years now. 1) I don't use it with the screen up at max brightness; 2) When it's not connected to the cigarette lighter adapter, I disable the WA-AS setting (more than doubles the power consumption); 3) I avoid using the GPS feature for navigation when on battery power (only use it for spot locating a position) since the GPS really consumes lots of power; 4) I watch the on screen battery indicator for low charge and when it gets low guess what? I  turn it off and put it on the charger as soon as I have the chance."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,FAST AND FINE!,"For the price, you can't find a better quality printer than this one.  Easy to use, easy to load, easy to change settings, easy to be satisfied with your purchase.  Highly recommended.  I have had excellent results both for photograph printing (large size, excellent resolution) and regular page printing"
electronics,,5.0,What else can I say but...,"What else can I say but ""it's excellent!!! I enjoy using it, traveling with it, using it to carry music and video's, and talking books, back and forth to work. The only thing it needs is a convienient way to hook it up to my car speaker system with out major surgery"
electronics,,5.0,very good,my compact flash card works just fine & good here very fast.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Love it,I really like my xt home kit. I never have to listen to crappy music again!
electronics,,4.0,Great Buy!,"We initially bought this for the baby's room, and have it in ours, while she is still small. We have found that it is a great product. The clock is automatic, as is the date which is a nice feature. We use the CD feature mostly at bedtime. We keep the volume on the CD pretty low, which unfortunately also controls the alarm as well. The blue light when it runs is not too bright - It actually serves as a nice night light. The nature sounds are very soothing, and we will probably use that feature more when she is older.  I wish that these were independent of eachother. Other than that, this has been a super product"
electronics,6 of 13,2.0,Not happy....,"I have used the FVS318 for about 4 years now. I was hit by lightening and blew out one router on my VPN. I bought a new one to replace it and found that the new V3 is not backward compatible with the older versions. I had to totally reconfigure the unit and purchase another one to replace the older unit that DID work. Netgear also has posted on their website that they will in no way pay or discount the purchase of a new router due to the lack of backward compatibility. I would suggest going away from this router and possibly going away from netgear. I have been a huge netgear fan in the past, but... I recently replaced my personal wireless router with a Linksys"
electronics,10 of 11,1.0,Terrible customer support,"About 6 months after I started using my SanDisk card in my Canon camera, I started to get ""memory error"" problems.  I reformatted the card in the camera and that got things working for a few more months.  Now, reformatting using the camera doesn't work.  "
electronics,24 of 24,5.0,Pinpoint precision,"This is a great GPS, probably the best I've ever used. I started with GPS in 1997 with the Garmin GPS 38, and three years later purchased an eTrex. I was satisfied with that, but when I heard about the added features of the 72, I went ahead and bought it to replace the eTrex. It is far more powerful than the eTrex and easier to use. The 72 makes excellent use of its dedicated zoom and menu keys. These alone make this unit quicker and easier to operate than some entry-level units. The display is of higher resolution which makes things like track lines more precise--a real problem on the eTrex, on which the track appeared as a thick black line that didn't show many meanders or fine movements. Many of the software features that the GPS 38 had, but the eTrex didn't, are included here, such as the ability to measure distance between waypoints, pan on the map page, and time-stamp marked points. The receiver in the 72 is very hot and sometimes gets you a fix within seconds. The software is apparently upgradeable and the receiver is WAAS-enabled, so it's ready for the next generation of navigation. Like most GPS units it's completely waterproof and it's worked for me under very unfavorable conditions. The third GPS I've owned and probably the last one I'll ever need to buy. Another job well done by Garmin"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,great printer,affordable printer that prints a very good quality shot.  i have particularly enjoyed working with black and white cartridges.  a good buy indee
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Nice to see better storage,"I have the previous version of this product with a fixed 24 MB of memory. I am very happy with it except for the storage. I think this is the same item only with an expandable memory. It is small, so you can use it on the street. Easily fist into your pocket. Mark your car when you park in a city that you are not familiar with and you don't have to worry about it again. Do your shopping and come back with the GPS. However, the screen is a little small to use in the car. It is usable, but I would still prefer a larger screen for the car. But all in all, I guess this is the right size both for hiking and driving."
electronics,18 of 18,4.0,has worked well for me,"This product works well for me.  I have three wired computers connected to it as well as my Netgear WG102 wireless access point.  Upstream from the router is my Netgear FR114P wired-only router and from that my Motorola SB5100 cable modem.  I've had this setup for 6 months now and no lockups or wierd reboots from any of the equipment.  After dealing with flakey networking problems for almost 3 years from various equipment, I now swear by Netgear ""blue box"" equipment.  (And I've had issues with Netgear consumer ""white plastic"" equipment, among other brands of consumer equipment.)"
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Wide Screen Recording,"There is one, but serious flaw in this DVD recorder which is not spelled out very well in the Instruction Manual.  If you want to record widescreen material and have it play back in widescreen format, you must use a DVD-RAM disk.  Although it will record using DVD-R and other formats, if you use them to record a widescreen image, it will pay back in a squished full screen image. I think this should have been noted prominently in the instruction material"
electronics,,5.0,It works,This product works well. You can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders. Theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside. I can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great sound and quality,"I've never paid this much for a pair of earbuds. I purchased a $30 pair of Sony earbuds, and the difference in sound quality between those and the ZENs is very noticeable. I have a ZEN Microphoto, and I was impressed with the quality of that, so I went with another Creative product. I'm not disappointed. It's important to note that ALL earbud-type of headphones require them to be seated properly in the ear canal in order to get full audio quality. These are no different. The first thing I noticed is that I have reduced the volume on my player, and have turned the extra bass OFF; there's no need for it with these. I highly recommend this product"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Lexar Professional CF cards,"I'm a working photographer who has been, after several years use, getting write errors on my Lexar Professional CF cards 1 Gb and 2 Gb. I contacted Lexar about what to do and was told that the professional cards have a lifetime warranty and they are now in the process of replacing my cards, after 40K to 50K exposures on each. Quite happy with them"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent CD-RW,"It is an excellent product, easy to install, really powerful, the only minus is the burner software, if you have or you can purchase Nero or CDRWin then you can obtain the maximum performance from this unit"
electronics,15 of 17,5.0,"Great, Soft and Practical",I purchased this for my special needs son who is 4 and needed a case for his cd player. It is very lightweight and soft and has space for a few of his cds. The adjustable belt is very easy to open and close and make larger and smaller. I am very pleased to have made this purchase
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great price,I bought it to hook up my x-box 360 to my computer. It works great and i did not have to spend $100.00 on a wireless
electronics,,5.0,Wireless Headphones,Best move I've done in awhile. The sound quality is excellent with no static or other anoying side sounds that I had on the other phones I have had
electronics,,4.0,Great bass for small headphones,"The portapros have great bass for small headphones.  And at least when I bought them, the Amazon price made them well worth it.  The only little quibble I have with them is that when you put them down around your neck for a minute, the headband contracts and gets very tight"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect,"It got to me quickly, even before the estimated arrival date, in perfect condition. It blows away my last MP3 player. And best of all, Microsoft and/or Apple don't have their hands in this device. No playsforsure. No i-tunes. That's the best part. I pity all of you with i-pods and playsforsure mp3 players. You'll never know what it's like to not be a corporate lacky unless you get an MP3 player like this one."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Simply Amazing!,"I use these in my office hooked up to my ipod, and it is quite an amazing experience!  If you are researching all the options for ipod speakers this is by far the best one - you just hook this up directly into your ipod or ipod dock. They sound amazing"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,It's an advanced flash drive that leave others in the dust,"I was hesitant about the U3 launcher software included on this device - but after using it, I've found it very useful. Ordinary flash drives are great for copying files, but this is something beyond that. The ability to easily sync Outlook or other emails, and to bring apps with you that run off the flash drive and not the host computer is worth the price alone. It saves me lugging a laptop between home and work. I can run Skype anywhere without installing it on a host computer, because it's installed on the device."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Don't buy this!  ,"I got this thing as a wedding gift.  I attempted to use it after returning from my honeymoon.  It completely corrupted the memory card and of the 80 pictures on the card, only 12 were readable.  The camera then could no longer read them either.  It's bad enough that it destroyed a $30 memory card, but it lost all of my honeymoon pictures which are irreplaceable.  I've had some poor products before, but this one goes down as the worst of all time. "
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"A bit bulky, but it's all good","As a journalist, I need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever I went. Now, with the Zen's microphone/recording feature, I'm able to use it to record my interviews, and it's easier to transcribe because of its clear, crisp recording quality."
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Great product...shame it does not work,"I did my research for an automotive GPS unit and ended up with the iWay 350c because it had way more features than similarly priced units, or was half the price of units with similar features (however you want to see it). The unit worked flawlessly for exactly 3 days. The GPS was pretty accurate (within 200ft), the FM modulator was very clear, and the MP3 player worked fine. I was on the road for those 3 days so I really got to enjoy it. I loved the MP3/FM modulator combination because I like my music kinda loud in the car so I was happy that the unit would interrupt the music to give me the next instruction and then go back to it. It was all fun and games until the 4th day, when the unit stopped being able to communicate with any satellites. I worked in quality assurance for years so I understand that nobody can test every single unit, and it would not bother me had the unit arrived defective. The fact that the unit developed the defect within 3 days however, has me thinking about the quality assurance of the vendors that supply Lowrance with the components they use. I called Lowrance and after a 20 minute wait I got an agent that had me reboot the unit and then asked me to send it in for a fix. I chose to return it to Amazon instead (since it never made the 30 day mark) and get my money back. As of right now I don't know if I will get another one. I may wait until a later version of this unit, when hopefully quality issues have been sorted out. If you do buy one, do yourself a favour and buy it from a reputable store so that you can return it should something go wrong"
electronics,16 of 16,1.0,Not compatible with all ipods other than mini's,So I just purchased the reader to take on a trip figured it would be nice to have. Well not so nice if you have the ipod video because it's not compatible so just a heads up if you are going to buy this item
electronics,,4.0,"Good, but uncomfortable for long use","I find this headphone/microphone set very good in quality of sound and other features, but it becomes uncomfortable for long use. I sometimes have to use it for conference calls or other calls in skype or google talk. Sometimes the calls extend beyond an hour. It gets painful during those times."
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Really nice & features packed,I bought this player for my son (16 y.o.) in Jan 2006.
electronics,,4.0,excellent for price,"I bought this for work. I was using the ""basic"" dell keyboard but use the wireless comfort keyboard at home. Using two different keyboards was causing me to make errors, so I bought this for work to aleviate this. The change was surprisingly effective. I recommend for anyone looking for an inexpensive 'quality' keyboard"
electronics,,5.0,I guess we're the exception...,"We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color & b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works like it should except for Yahoo! messenger,"This camera works great for me. The onboard microphone picks up my voice up to 10 feet away, and I didn't have to shout so my friend could here me talking. He did notice that I was moving away from the mic so he understood why my voice was getting softer."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Will not record,"I finished up my last batch of these discs bought some time ago, without a problem. BUT the next batch purchased most recently will not record on my Philips CDR 765. There are too many different types of media discs and not labeled properly. Should be an industry standard that the consumer can readily see that they can use them. Not sure what to get now or if another brand will work properly"
electronics,,5.0,A winner case for the iPod 30 GB,"I am pleased with this case.  Good quality; good fit.  The 5G black iPod needs a covering; this case fits the bill.  If you wish to plug in an AirPlay2 FM transmitter, you will probably have difficulty as the connector on the AirPlay is not long enough to overcome the thickness of the DLO case, but a Maxell Remote plugged in fine and then the AirPlay2 could be plugged into the bottom of the  Maxell Remot"
electronics,,5.0,A first time DigiArtist,"I love this Tablet, It's just like working with the real thing with out all that mess, just got to get used to it, I never thought I woulde use the modern art tech but I gave it a chance and I love it."
electronics,41 of 41,4.0,The best 7.1 system under $100,"This is probably the best 7.1 system for less than $100.  That being said, it's not everyone's perfect match."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Great product, excellent quality for the price.","This player is awesome!  I am having fun with my new toy.  I like the larger screen and the thin styling.  It has all the up-to-date and modern AV-I/O connections.  Play music, video games, camcordings, etc.  Battery could last a little longer but the features are power-juicers"
electronics,,5.0,A nice case for iPod and accesories,"I'm very pleased with the INCASE travel pack. Have a good design for all you have to carry with your iPod, and a car charger is included. Good quality and size. A must for iPod users"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Coby dVd player,The item works well and is very good considering that I paie less than $30 for it. It may not have the whistles and bells that the more expensive ($80) dvd players have but as a basic unit it is great
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Great keyboard,"I got one of these because it's the only USB keyboard allowed by our company.  But what a surprise!  I find the reshaped keys really innovative, and the touch pressure required allows me to type really quickly (I touch type and laptop keyboards work with too little pressure to touch type quickly -- they cause more errors).  Of course, I always liked the good old IBM clicky keyboards best (i.e. [...]), but this one, while it does not click like the IBM, allows me to type almost as fast.  Until this keyboard was developed, the IBM stood alone.  One additional tip: I find that I need a wrist pad in front of this keyboard (I have the matching black Kensington one) to get maximum speed out of this keyboard"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Highly Recommended,"Although this skin increases the thickness of your 30GB iPod to that of a previous generation iPod, it's not unacceptable at all.  The protection that this skin gives is supurb - dirt, grime, sweat are all kept away from your iPod.  I highly recommend iSkin's products for those who want good protection for their iPod that also looks cool"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,Great alternative to photo paper,"We used to print our marketing literature on glossy photo paper (architecture firm, lots of pictures).  Tried this paper and loved it.  The pictures are just as crisp with only a very slight color difference from the glossy paper, and it's about 75% cheaper"
electronics,,1.0,Bad,"If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings."
electronics,,4.0,Great gaming accessory,"In my opinion, the Fang definitely does not fall into the ""must have"" category of PC accessories... but it sure is nice to have one! The keys are soft and comfortable and the response time is good. It doesn't have that clicky feedback you get from your keyboard but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The button placement is great and the ZEngine software is very nice (if a little prone to startup crashes). The Fang could theoritically be a great accessory for gamers on the go because it is far superior to any integrated laptop keyboard. However, in practice, it is a little too big to qualify as a portable accessory. Then again, if you are already lugging around a 15-20lbs gaming laptop then I don't see why you'd have problems adding this one to your backpack (or trailer). All in all, I am very happy with the Fang"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Ipod speaker,I bought the speaker to use in my office. I've found it to be quite neat and fat enough to tuck away. The audio quality is excellent and it has been worth every penny. I recommend this product to anyone
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Worthless,"I've had two sets of Memorex DVD-R discs and no matter what they last a year at best, burned or not.  Save yourself alot of headaches and spend an extra $5 dollars on another brand that actually works"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Defective Product,Received the phone and within 30 days the phone ceased working.  While covered under warranty I had to foot the shipping cost in order to obtain a replacement. 
electronics,2 of 9,5.0,use this as a slave to Digital Performer and you can do anything!!,"If you think the synth sound is cheesy, buy Digital Performer, a motu 828, and an SM57.  Record you own sounds, and then use those with Reason instead of the cheesy syth stuff!  You can also sample audio off of CDs in Digital Performer, and use those audio files in Reason!  If you have the money, you might as well go all out..."
electronics,,5.0,Great Digital Card,Quality of pictures are good - I was able to take and store a lot of them without the quality suffering
electronics,2 of 10,5.0,Awesome,This will make you hate your speakers.  I do suggest a decent headphone amplifier(Headroom for example) and a high end replacement cable like Cardas.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,just what a mouse should be like,"I wanted a clean, nicely designed mouse, given that the trend is having more and more buttons and lights. This mouse is simply great, my previous mouse was also Microsoft, I bought it in 1998, and it's still working flawlessly, so its was down to a Microsoft or maybe a Logitech one. The decision to buy this mouse was mainly taken based on its design and the fact that only has two buttons and a scroll wheel, nothing more. It's a little bit more expensive than the competition, but in my opinion is well worth the couple of extra dollars. The construction is great, is has just the exact amount of weight, when you push a button the click feels sturdy and with great feedback. I started appreciating the good things about this mouse after using it for a while. A mouse is a simple device; it should be kept that way, and its small things that make a mouse a great one. I can easily understand why people have been raving about this mouse for so many years and still continue doing so"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Service as promised,This was handled in the way I expect. Delivery time was acceptable
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,Mute feature is inadequate design,"If you're sitting on a call at home listening and don't want the kids and dogs to intefere... or on a cell phone in traffic, you don't want this headset.  The MUTE only works if you hold the button down the whole time. The mute doesn't stay on.  Needless to say this is unacceptable. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Portable AND semi-permanent applications,"First thing first, this unit takes up BOTH plugs.  There is a three-prong plug and a second ground prong on the back.  There is also a screw that mounts this unit (semi-permanently) to the wall socket.  You simply back out the screw that holds the plastic wall plate to your outlet and screw this in, leaving the plastic wall plate in place.  (I probably wrote that in a way that comes off as complicated, but it's not.)  You can remove the screw from the unit and take it on vacation / trips with you for your laptop and what not."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Outshines the competition,"I did a lot of shopping around before purchasing this printer, including testing it and other models for myself as well as reading reviews.  It definitely had the best print quality -- especially noticeable in color -- compared to its similar-priced competitors.  Other (higher-priced) printers can produce higher-quality photo prints, but for an all-around all-in-one machine, you can't beat the MP830.  "
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Wow - buy one.,"I have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.  "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Very pleased.,"I bought these speakers about 4 days ago and have been quite pleased from the word go.  The grandparents went to work today and I tested them at peak power.  Frankly, I was amazed.  I was able to clearly hear my music from the back deck, across an 1800sq. ft. rambler house.  More than enough power than I will ever need.  Quality of sound is amazing as well.  I bought these to hook up to my pc for my music and my entertainment center with my DVD player and gaming systems.  Very, very happy with my purchase."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,I Own 5,"I own five of these.  The first one I bought at least a year and a half ago, maybe two.  Not a problem with any of them, ever.  They're fast and at a good price point.  If you do any kind of action photography where your camera's buffer comes into play it's worth the extra money to buy a card that will read and write faster"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,In my opinion this product is good:,"""The Perfect Installation"""
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,October 2006,"This dvd player is potentially a great, cheap and versatile machine BUT... "
electronics,,1.0,ugh!,Just bought this at WalMart ($20!) and will be returning it tonight. Only one of the 4 88 stations is empty here but still couldn't hear the music over the hiss and static. I vaguely knew of this products reputation but bought it anyway...big mistake.
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Papa's got a brand new mousepad!,"I'm sorry for the horrible subject lining... but yes, I just bought this mousepad minutes ago, and am trying it as we speak. I've always been into mousepads... whether for their design, easiness to use, and of course accuracy and comfort. I've always wanted a gel-mousepad but haven't gotten around to getting one. I recently saw the IConcepts Large Mousepad (the dark blue circular one with a fairly small and oversized wrist rest). Anyways, that was my initial choice b/c of the price ($6.99), but it was basically rigid. So naturally I began looking at the other brands on display... and saw this exact same Belkin product... in color black. Soft enough, decent price ($9.99) and the wrist rest was large/wide enough to support the ENTIRE wrist (god help those who actually move their mouse throughout the ENTIRE pad, right, just like the rest of us), anyways, I went down and saw the color in silver, and got it for the same price."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,H10 has been an excellent MP3 Player,"I have read some of the negative reviews and agree with some of them, on a very limited basis. Most I disagree with. Maybe some of these folks have bought lemons. I bought my first H10, the red 5GB, over a year ago. Since then, for family members, I have bought:"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Just great,I purchased the calculator for my son who attends high school. After reviewing the book that came with the calculator I was surprised with all the features it offers. I told him that many engineer students would love to have one. I wished I had one when I studied mechancal engineering many years ago. It is clear he will use at first just few of the features but as he decided for math-physics he will use it permanently for the next couple of years. No doubt it will also help him when he is at the University.   
electronics,6 of 8,4.0,Stand doesn't swivel,"There's a lot to like about this TV.  Unfortunately, the stand doesn't swivel (side to side) - if that matters to you, be sure to factor that into your decision"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,If God Needed Headphones...,"... These would be them. I listen to everything, but i specialize in trance and other electronica, and I have yet to hear something bad from these headphones. They feel great on your ears and the cord is long, but doesnt get in the way thanks to the coiling. As for the sound, wether it is Bach, Zeppelin, or Tiesto, they are the most HI FI phones i have ever put on. I DJ, but it doesnt matter if you are just going to listen to AM radio, get these phones. For the price, they wont let you down."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,great for our need,"Got this is a gift  -- intended for my daughter who will be travelling on an international flight.   Product was great, easy to use, picture and audio were clear.  It kept my daughter from getting bored during the flight.  Bonus pack was great too... its like they've thought of everything you need and included it in the package"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Review of GPSMap 60C/60CS Case,This is a must have to protect such an expensive purchase. It fits well and I still have all the functionality.
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,"Finally, a quality security lock.","After trying a couple of other security locks, this one finally turned out to be a very well designed one. I completely agree with the previous reviews. The cable appears to be very strong, the lock itself works as it is supposed to. No problem here. I actually like locks with keys as opposed to combination locks. But it is my personal preference. You can go to kensington web site and register your lock and your keys, so that in case you lose them, kensington will send you new ones. Very nice. "
electronics,8 of 10,2.0,It was surprise for me,Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
electronics,10 of 11,1.0,Combination mysteriously changed,"I had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble. All of a sudden, today, as I went to pick up the lock, which had been left untouched in the open position overnight with my combination in it, it decided to change combinations by itself. So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites. The fact that I even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock I can't rely on"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Top-notch laptop security,"This is a tremendous product that is exceptionally simple and effective. I bought one for my laptop when I entered college. I secured it to a part of my desk, and could then ease my mind when my roommate's friends would come and go, if we had study groups, or if someone managed to break in. I worked at the superintendent's office of my dorm and heard tons of complaints about laptops being ripped off, and this is a terrific solution to protect your valuable investment."
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Great Inexpensive Speakers,"Ok, I am not an audiophile but for a little over $10 +SH you can't go wrong with these speakers. Look good, sound good, and capture every bit of the music I need to hear. For a laptop or desktop, this is a great buy. They also sound great using my Zen Nano....Can't go wrong.............."
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,Perfect for 2gb microSD and Garmin 60CSx GPS receiver,"I bought Garmin MapSource City Navigator North America, v.8 to go with my new Garmin 60CSx GPSmap handheld receiver.  I also bought a 2gb SanDisk microSD card.  The entire 1.6gb North America map fits on this chip and works well with the 60 CSx handheld."
electronics,,4.0,Just right,"This is a good headset for my Panasonic cordless phone. It is comfortable - I wear it on and off for at least a couple of hours per day and it's never bothered me. Sound quality is very good, both incoming and outgoing - if anything, the microphone borders on too sensitive: people can clearly hear my music from the living room when I'm in the kitchen, and I can never get away with typing unnoticed on my exceptionally quiet keyboard! The only issue I have is that the wires seem to be thin and cheap, as every time the cord moves there is a scratching noise, which I guess will mean a relatively short lifespan - although not unreasonably low for the price. All in all, I am very satisfied and I recommend this headset"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Bugs in firmware,"The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is ""admin"". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Worked as expected -- pleased with purchase.,The Reader worked as advertised.  I'm very pleased with the purchase..
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Protection Is Not A Problem,"I know that these were designed to keep my iPod safe, well these do a great job at it, so safe that you can hardly get them off once you put a tube on!  If you have a docking station for you Nano - I would not get these because you have to remove the skin in order to dock you Nano!  I like the fact that you get five different colors in the pack - however I don't see myself changing it often with such a tight fit!  This is good buy for the money, and protects my iPod wonderfully"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Crappy Tuner,I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future model
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,It is perfect.,"I just installed a network between my two home computers, and this cable did the job perfectly.  It worked just like it is supposed to, and the 50ft length gave me all the cable I needed, with plenty left in case I decide to re-arrange the desk locations.  WELL worth the $10.99 price"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Better than many cases,"When I first saw the iPod Socks introduced I thought it was a silly but interesting idea for a case.  I wasn't planning on buying them and didn't give it a second thought.  When I saw one of my friend's iPod with an iPod Sock and actually played with them I realized that they're really cool.  It's one of those things where you have to see to believe.  I've had mine for a few days now and love them.  Nice part is on all the iPods you can easily use the buttons (except the scroll wheel), even the 3G iPods, though it takes a little bit more effort witht that model"
electronics,,5.0,The best photo paper i've ever used!,"I scrapbook, so i like to print what i need to scrap at home, one page at a time.  This way i do not have a million pictures laying around staring at me and overwhelming me.  I've purchased Kodak paper which i felt was grainy, and printed dark.  Its expensive too.  I bought HP glossy paper which was a heavier wieght and it was AWFUL.  The outlines on human bodies is black,and the ink dries raised in spots of high color, the paper feels awful, grainy nasty.  "
electronics,,4.0,Excellent Product,"I am satisfied by the purchase of this Targus CVR600 15.4 Groove Notebook Backpack since it is super wide, comfortable and with many compartments to keep objects  apart of the laptop. I recommend it to you"
electronics,,5.0,"Cheap, just enough extra juice.","This was a nice, small battery pack. with a fully charged ipod it provides plenty of juice for international flights. I wouldn't have minded an optional way to attach it to the ipod though, the dangling battery case sometimes was troublesome. All things considered, very content with my purchase"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Toshiba A1 HD-DVD upconverting DVD player,"In August I purchased the Toshiba HD-DVD player. Not only do HD-DVDs look great, but ALL DVDs look great. I would rank both HD and SD (standard definition) DVDs as superior in picture quality to HD-TV channels. This is because of the upconversion ability which converts 480i standard definition DVDs to 1080i. Even though HD-TV channels broadcast in either 720p or 1080i,"
electronics,19 of 20,5.0,Works like a charm,"I have a VOIP line and a backup landline; I had been through the nightmare of having two separate phones, and of always having the wrong one to hand, so I decided I was set on having a two-line phone.  The traditional landline was to be bare-bones, so the phone system needed to have an integrated answering machine (I've since turned off the voice mail on my VOIP line as well). And it needed to be 5.8GHz so it wouldn't interfere with the Wi-Fi reception (or vice-versa)."
electronics,,5.0,Apple iPod Remote and Earbuds,"This product was just what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use it for my iPod since I don't have the dock connector.  I gave it to my son, and he loves it.  This is very useful since you don't have to always take your iPod out to skip to the next song or increase the volume.  I just hope they have one without the dock connector."
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,TDK vs Memorex,"These cases are an outstanding buy for the price. You may find better ones, but you'll pay much more for them. These are vastly superior to the flimsy, fragile Memorex product of the same price range. These will do for most moderately handled media"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Works well but slows things down a bit.,I agree with the previous review about the passkey; it was no where in the documents. I even read the other review before buying but didn't understand what he was talking about. And I didn't remember his review when it came to the time that I needed the passkey. I'm not at all sure how mine is even functioning because I never did enter a passkey. I found the review again when I came back to enter my feedback. Belkin needs to do a better job of getting this info out where the customers can find it. PRINT IT IN THE DOCUMENTS OR PUT THE INITIAL PASSKEY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEVICE then allow them to change it if they want.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,XM Radio Belkin Audio System,Excellent sound quality.  Easy to plug in and out.  The remote is very handy when programming
electronics,9 of 10,1.0,It blew up my Palm charger for no reason,"I bought it  right before my trip to London, UK, and it was fine the first evening. But the next night I was trying to charge my Palm and use my laptop, it overheated while set at 50W (not 1600W) for no reason and blew up the Palm charger. I had to buy a new charger upon return."
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,Best little speakerless radio EVER,"I've spent a week with this little jewel and, after playing with the programming mode, finally got the hang of entering preset stations.  The manual doesn't do a capable enough job of explaining how to do it.  Once you get the jist of it, though, it's pretty easy.  The sound is incredible, the reception is very good, the size is amazing, and the battery life is very impressive.  ONE AAA lasts for quite a while, and, the little symbol that tells you ""battery wear"" is quite ingenious!!  This little companion is one of the best radios I've ever owned.  I've just ordered TWO more, just in case.  The little earbuds that come standard with the set do a very capable job.  One COULD upgrade and, perhaps, get better sound, but, not really needed.  I do a lot of brisk walking, and, this is the perfect companion for being on the road.  This would also be a great ""companion"" at ballgames.  The small size is amazing and the performance is tops.  It's no wonder that a lot of the websites that carry this item show that it's out of stock.  Get it.  It's a great radio.  By the way, the mega bass switch is extremely impressive.  The BIG sound of this set for such a small unit is unbelievable.  I LOVE this radio!!!"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,I've not used it yet but its a good idea to STAY PROTECTED,"I like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs, just set back and relax....YOUR COVERED. "
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,GREAT headphones (remove those small black clips for comfort!!),High quality sound -- with comfort. Very impressed.
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Wireless network router- D-Link 802.11g,Successfully installed and is working perfect! No complaints or concerns! Great buy
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Waited too long for this beautiful picture,"Have cable and therefore use the ""box"" controls most.  I had some trouble following all of the setup instructions, but am pleased with the control I have now.  Expect that I can call for help, but haven't come to that point.  The picture is so clear and sharp I went in for an adjustment of my prescription.  The price was a real savings.  Delivery was very fast with no damage.  Setup was ""doable"" for a couple of seniors.  Try it, you'll like it"

electronics,,4.0,"Works fine for me, but it's noisy","This is a fairly ingenious device, with a pretend cassette that acts as an interface to get your iPod's music to your car stereo's speakers.  There is an umbilical off the cassette that connects to the iPod.  The adapter also allows your rewind and fast-forward buttons to move you forward or back a track. When you eject the cassette, it automatically pauses the iPod."

electronics,40 of 41,4.0,Placement may take practice,"I just purchased this unit and once I finally got it working I could not be more pleased. Just be warned that it was not as easy in my two story home to just plug one in upstairs and come downstairs with the other and have it work right away. Maybe I just have some &quot;funky&quot; wiring in this house, BUT I had to make about 6 trips up and down those stairs with a friend standing by the unit I wanted in the master bedroom while I tried various plugs upstairs until we finally got the things to work. All the electrical receptacles work fine, so I don't know why it did not work on the first try. Once working they are great...just keep in mind flexibility of placement in the event you have an experience similar to mine. I'm going to order another set to use between the den and my husband's workshop and feel they are a great deal for the cost and so much easier than a &quot;hard wired&quot; system"
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,Looks and sounds great. Feels like a Conair.,"We have a 1941 house in California complete with a little phone shrine in the kitchen, and nothing but an old fashioned phone could live up to the special little nook.  For $19.99 (at an electronics store) I have the look.  And the sound.  It sounds like a dramatic phone ring in an old movie.  The only thing it doesn't have is that twenty pound heft I associate with real old phones.  Looks and sounds old, but feels like a Conair"

electronics,,4.0,Great for the $,"I got these ear buds to use along with my notebook computer since they are so small and easy to carry.  I have had several Sony products in the past with no complaints and like this design of ear bud.  Plus they are under $10, even if they get lost or break after a year or so your not out much.  For what they are, they do a very good job.  You can't really expect great sound quality or build quality in this price range.  If you want a great set of headphones check out the Sennheiser HD-595s, you won't regret it"
electronics,40 of 45,5.0,DVD got better,"I have a Sony 36&quot; Vega and a Sony DVD player that were hooked up with RCA cables.  I got a nature DVD and it was pretty good with the RCA cables.

electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Beware when using with WPA-Enterprise,"We bought this AP to use with WPA Enterprise using a radius server and basically, it dosen't work. At first we couldn't get it to communicate with our radius server at all. We resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked. Then authentication worked, but we couldn't get an address via DHCP. We couldn't resolve this so we assigned a static address, but couldn't pass any traffic over the link. Unfortunately, we found the Linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless. There only suggestion was to try different firmware. Once we had done this, they couldn't help any more. So basically, they might say it works, but it doesn't. Tried a different manufacturers AP, worked straight away."

electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Ipod settings and video quality,"This product works well and allows for you to view pictures and videos on your TV. The resolution was very good on an average sized tv, for larger TVs the video quality suffers a bit but it is still worth purchasing the cables. "
electronics,,5.0,Works exactly as it should,"What can I say?  It fits exactly, functions exactly as it should.  Does not obstruct the screen or cover the ports.  I use it to save the Micro from being beaten around in my bag on the way to work either in my car on on my bike.  Works so far.  Easy to clean and install although having said that, in 3 months it has stayed pretty clean. "

electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Toner Problems,"i have been using an HP 4600 for about 2 years now. There is one more printer of the same model in my building. BOTH printers have developed this problem of printing a nice, fat magenta line across the backs of pages. This problem was not so bad on my printer until just recently, but now over 50% of what I print goes straight to the recycling bin becuase the printer ruins the pages with that line!! VERY ANNOYING!!! It works great other than that. It seems like a problem that would be easy to resolve but its NOT. NO ONE can fix it! We have called several repair people who have come to look at it and they are all stumped. The only advice HP will give is to simply clean it with a damp cloth. This resolves the problem long enough to end your help session with HP and then the line is back again! The other 4600 in the building was just replaced becuase of the red line problem.  I am on the verge of losing my mind and/or replacing mine!"

The buttons make sense; both DVDs and videotapes play perfectly. I've had mine for a year and a half. I see that other folks have written that they have had problems, but I have had no problems at all. Although I primarily use it for DVDs,I really love this machine, and would recommend it to anyone who still has videos, and who hates complicated buttons and/or directions on their remotes"
electronics,,5.0,A mini hard drive,I had bought this one at the end of 2004 and I still use it heavily. I have downloaded and erased thousands of Giga bytes of data thousands of time.

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Horrible Q&A, other than that it's a nice little router","I bought one from CompUSA a month ago, but it was resetting itself every 10-15 seconds. Replaced it, and that one simply stopped responding while I was updating its firmware. Third one works in AP and router mode, but cannot connect to WPA-PSK networks under client mode. It works good if the wireless network is wep encrypted or completely open. I don't need the client mode anyway but still I prefer completely working units."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Plug it in and forget about it,This was a great buy.  It works very well and does everything the manufacturer said it was supposed to do.  I want my products to work efficiently and effectively and this auto charger does both so I highly reccomend it

electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Good...but not prefect,"The Samsung LNS3251D 32 is one of the best picture quality TV I have had the pleasure to own. The only major drawback on this model is the sound quality.  This may be easily fixed with the addition of a home theater sysyem, but should it ne necessary?  My three Sony Trinitons have great sound without an added system and if Samsung is going to continue to maintain it's assault on Sony marketshare, it better follow suit.  Overall this is a great TV and the sound problem is tolerable. "

electronics,40 of 54,4.0,"512 megs, at a premium.","For a long time, MultiMediaCards (MMCs) were a tough sell against other formats such as CompactFlash & SmartMedia (and lately vs Sony Memory Sticks too), largely because they were offered in smaller memory capacities and always had a higher cost-per-meg than those formats. The SD card (interchangeable with MMC cards) is a format which has some distinct advantages over the other formats in terms of physical size and memory protection. However, when compared to other SD cards of smaller sizes (eg. the several 256MBs available), there is a considerable premium here on a dollar-per-meg basis (all of those are well under 50 cents per meg). I think for most folks it makes more sense to buy two 256 MBs than to put all one's eggs (and files) in one costlier basket. When the new 1 Gig cards come out, the price on the 512s will drop"

My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare). It says ""out of power"" even though I fully chraged it for hours. I found out that if i hit the device it would start again. As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way. I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated. I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again. If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson: US$700"

It does not appear to cause a significant power drain on my iPAQ battery, so it must be a fairly efficient chip. The write speed of this chip is roughly 40% slower than a Sandisk Ultra II CF, which is preferrable for digital cameras. For reliable storage and backup applications though, this 2GB CF is now an excellent value"

electronics,,2.0,Serious Problems.,I got this player from Best Buy and thought that I had gotten a good deal. The battery life is very misleading. A charge overnight is supposed to give you 12 hours of battery life. With normal menu usage and about 600 songs the battery life dropped to maybe 2 hours.

So much that I bought a Muvo 128 on sale somewhere for my son to use.  Then, I bought the Muvo FM 1 Gb to get more room and then bought the 512 when I saw it on sale as a backup.  Only 1 drawback I can see, the sound isn't as loud as I would wish it to be, but hey!  It's only got 1 itty bitty AAA battery... whadda ya' expect?  15 hrs of playing time is worth the tradeoff and the thing hardly weighs more than a pack of gum."

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Good Sound Quality, but...","I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Very good sound.,"I tried this mainly because the reviews of all the other transmitters I could find were poor. This one has been a very pleasant surprise. The sound quality is very good, and there is no static---it does its job. My only quibble is the fixed number of transmission channels, though I have not had a problem finding an open channel; the channel LED's are a little dim and tough to see in daylight."

electronics,,4.0,good deal!,TDK miniDV tapes at amazon is good deal. this price is worthy to buying also it is free shipping. TDK is a fomous brand especially on vidio and audio tape. The making of this tape is really fine. 
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Over a year and still fantastic,"Have had the SoundDock for well over a year, and the sound quality is still amazingly crisp, clear and even.  For such a small unit it is surprising how easily it fills a room with sound, with almost no distortion even at high volumes.  There is no fall-off in range or articulation of each note, even when going from a pounding base in pop/rock/disco to the delicate and intricate orchestrations in classical music as I've experienced with other speaker systems.  Often the challenge for other small bookshelf units is maintaining fidelity in classical piano pieces - notes in the upper register often sound weak, distant, and somewhat tinny.  In contrast, with this unit they are full and beautifully resonant.  "
electronics,,4.0,Good mouse for road shows!,"When the time came to replace my clunky ""tailed"" mouse, I knew I wanted a wireless and that it had to be optical. I was originally going to buy the V400 because of it's small size, but this mouse's features kept bringing me back to it. I'm now glad I bought this one."
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Problems with two different units,"I bought my first LT30HV LCD TV in December, 2004.  After about 8 or 9 months I would continually lose the picture.  After several discussions with Customer Service (they had me try various things to correct the problem), they decided to ship me a new TV.  I received it in early October, 2005 & everything was fine - at first.  About 10 months later, the set started going black after it was first turned on & I had to turn it off & then on again.  Over the course of the next couple of months, this problem got progressively worse.  Now, I sometimes have to turn it off & on 10 to 20 times before it will stay on.  So, I have had two sets -- neither of which worked a full year.  Also, I found out that the second set that was sent to me was a refurbished set.  I have spoken with technical support and customer service on many occasions but they refuse to do anything about it because it is ""out of warranty"""
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,No Stars,This is an example of awful engineering and product design.
electronics,12 of 15,4.0,Motorola 2-line phone,This phone was everything it was reported to be with one exception. The wall mount feature causes the phone to sit too high for any standard wall mount jack. Also the wall mount had the phone extending out from the wall much more than a atandard wall mounted phone would be. These problems stem from the design which is truely a desk model type of phone.
electronics,7 of 7,2.0,Dissappointing,"I have been on a bit of a quest for decent and user-friendly noise cancelling cans for a few months.  I use trains and subways to commute, and I think I did damage to my hearing years ago when I would drown out the subway noise with my headphones.  I figure noise cancellation (or reduction) technology would help prevent further damage.  I had the Sennheisser PCX-250 (list $150), which sounded reasonably good and had fairly effective noise cancellation, but was very cumbersome to use, with a lot of cords to get tangled with the remote cords on my CD player (iRiver SlimX 450).  They were fairly comfortable.  I then moved to the Aiwa branded Sony noise cancellation phones (list ~$60).  These do not have a separate battery/circuitry compartment like the Sennheissers, but instead, like the Koss QZ-50, have these built into the headset.  They are moderately comfortable but bulky.  The noise cancellation is pretty effective, although it adds a significant amount of hiss (more than the Sennheissers).  The sound overall is balanced, a little bass-heavy and ragged in the treble range, but overall quite listenable.  Best of all, the Aiwa is very sensitive, so it is easy to drive, and saves CD player batteries (since you run the player at lower volume levels to achieve the same loudness).  I tried the Koss QZ-50 because I hoped the behind-the-neck design would be more comfortable and less geeky looking.  Also, I love the Porta-Pros, and was hoping the QZ-50 would sound like them.  The QZ-50s sound just OK.  Not very extended in the bass, no better than the Aiwas up top.  They are fairly comfortable, although the earcups tended to slip down off my ears when I walked.  Unfortunately, while the noise cancellation processing does not add any significant hiss, it also doesn't seem to reduce noise at all.  Add to that the QZ-50s high impedance (which requires higher volume settings on the player), and the QZ-50 is not worth keeping.  I'd try the more expensive Koss QZ based on the Porta-Pro, but it, too, uses a separate, wired compartment for batteries and circuitry.  I do not recommend the QZ-50 as a solution for listening in noisy environments"
electronics,,2.0,Good Sound...when it's working,"While I am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me, I am a little disappointed. I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace). Bose failed me once, shame on them. They failed me twice, shame on me. I'm gonna go with something else"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great replacement.,"Replace your cheap satellite home receiver interconnect with this sweetheart. It is better made, its longer and music quality ( to my ear) is better especially with the highs. Very happy."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,SUPERB,"I have been taking pictures on Nikon camera for 2 years and decided I needed a bigger SD card. I'm so glad I got this one. Its construction makes it very durable. This one is much faster than my old card. I had no trouble copying files on and off the card through the camera, and it's even faster through a USB card reader. I am looking forward to taking more higher quality pictures and movies on my new card!"
electronics,18 of 18,1.0,Not recommended,"I purchased this item hoping to put an end to all the compressed air cans that I use to clean. This was a waste of money and time all the thing does is make noise and give a slight breeze. You could easily blow more dust off of your equipment with your own lungs, even if they are filled with tar, than you can with this blower, and you might as well just scoop up anything that you want to use the vacuum to clean. I was very disappointed in this product"
electronics,,5.0,Good quality for the price,"This headset is a replacement for the one I had on a 2 line phone by Plantronics. It is versatile, for in can be used over the head or just placed in the ear with the attachments provided. It is light and confortable because of the cushion. But the best feature is the reduction or blocking of noise which allows you to hear and be heard clearly, making it very affordable for the price."
electronics,,5.0,good for the price ,"worth the money.  don't need a 100 dollar speaker, this thing is good enough."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Doesn't seem like it would make a difference but...,"boy did it ever!  The cable company came and installed our cable modem and used a cheap splitter.

Anyway, I wanted to listen to all my music in my car from my i-pod without making a cd for everything.  The device ruined the experience for me because I cannot get a good sound without static and bad reception.  I was disappointed"
electronics,,5.0,Very functional,"A very useful addition to my Palm device, it does drink the juice, but as someone else suggested, downloading the news with Avantgo allows you to unplug the card and then read hours of news without worrying about running out of power.  When you want to access the internet without lugging around the laptop, this does the trick"

electronics,,5.0,An Outstanding Mouse,"Silky smooth trackball and scrollwheel, a real pleasure to use. Ergonomically, this mouse is very well designed; one's hand rests comfortably and naturally on it. I use this mouse for many hours each day and have never had a problem with my thumb.....true, some folks may experience some thumb discomfort after heavy use, but everyone's different, right?  There's no one mouse that's perfect for everyone."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent Product and Price,Simply plug and play. Additionally Dazzle Reader shows up as a separate drive under Window's. Easy to move files back & forth to the reader.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Love it !,"First, I'm not a techno expert.  I heard this soundsystem at a BBQ at my sister in laws house.  Sound was amazing so I decided to duplicate it.  Very pleased, sound is crisp & clear.  Bought an IPOD Nano to go along with this. Very easy to use. We move it inside & outside with no problem.  To me, nothing beats the BOSE sound.  This was a splurge item and I'm very happy with the decision. Especially great for outdoor, makes excellent & easy sound system for our numerous BBQs.  Also super fast delivery from Music Friends."

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great product!,"We got this cover for our son's Ipod since he is going out of the country and wanted something sturdy for traveling.  One of the best features is the cover for the wheel. We experienced no trouble putting the Ipod in this cover and while I think it is possible that it may collect more lint due to the rubbery composition, a damp, lint-free cloth should be all that is required to clean it again.  Looks sharp and offers extra protection from bumps. He really liked this a lot"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,So much better than a mouse!,I have 2 cordless TrackMan Wheels & 2 corded versions. I can't stand to use a computer that is not eqiped with one. It makes so much more sense to to simply use my thumb to navigate rather than having to keep picking up the mouse and moving it to get to whereever it is you are trying to go and ran out of mousepad before you could get there. The TrackMan is very sensible and reliable. Why they don't quit making mice and make more of these is beyond me. The people who don't like trackballs have just never really used a trackball. They must be same people that have made American cars cushy and buy iPods
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Works great!,"The Anti-static strap is a necessity for any guru computer user who opens up the comp. case often. Static can damage components, so you either have to touch the case every minute or so, or take the clip portion of the static band and hook it to the case. It fits quite comfortably around the wrist and it's cord expands to about double it's original size, and the wrist strap and the cord disconnect with a snap. Overall, it's a good investment, considering the price is significantly less then the components you might damage"
electronics,,5.0,Why Pay More!?,"This DVD burning isn't as cut and dried as some would like you to believe. However, just because you get a bad burn doesn't mean it is the discs. There is a whole bunch of stuff going on in your computer that can affect the burn. "
electronics,7 of 10,5.0,Great Splitter - low-loss is not more,"This is a great splitter and provided my system with a much better picture than the one's Adelphia provides.  I own a very sensative 51&quot; Sony HDTV so I need the best signal I can get after my split.  This splitter provided that for me.  The previous review is wrong &amp; I'm not sure where those numbers came from but the front of my splitter 2Ghz Monster Splitter says low-loss from 5mhz-1Ghz = -3.5dB and from 1Ghz-2Ghz -4.9dB.  What this means is that it's the same low-loss as the Adelphia splitters considering the Adelphia splitter only goes up to 1Ghz.  Along with the extra bandwidth, the overall build of the connections are better as well.  If you have an HDTV or mid-range to high-end Direct View, this is the splitter to get.  For those splitting their Internet cable line to watch TV in your PC room, again, this is the one to get"

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,It works like a charm ONLY IF you are willing to mod the TuneCast (EASY MOD),"I just purchased one from Fry's Electronics few days ago and it is the HP version of the TuneCast II. (Same spec. and the only difference is the HP packaging) It was on sale for only $14.99 prior the CA tax. I figure it's worth to try since it is so darn cheap! Here is the verdict based on my usage in Bay Area, California."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Just buy it.,"You know you want to.  You're thinking about it.  You're reading reviews, thinking ""Hey...maybe this is the one for me.""  You're thinking it, aren't you?  Of course you are.  And you should be.  Because it's the best bag ever.  There's room for everything, it smelled nice even right out of the plastic, and it fits very tiny people (me) and very large people (my friends).  It is very comfortable, and does not squash the [...] of either gender (this is a big deal for me since most backpacks squash my [...], and that makes me sad).  On a daily basis i drag my laptop, a tome-sized textbook, an old skool (paper) notebook, absurd amount of pens, calculator, an extra battery, cell phone charger, mp3 charger, usb mouse, laptop adapter, girly stuff (brush, makeup...girl things) and i can still cram extra clothes in there if i need to. i am a happy kitten."
electronics,,4.0,Good product,"The cradle is of good quality.  I guess from earlier cradles Palm has made they decided to make sure that when the Palm is in the cradle it will not come out easily.  For Palm TX models they snap into this cradle and it is a little difficult to release it to get it out of the cradle.  So if you were use to Palm's earlier cradles that were easier to get the Palm into and out of the cradle, this one will be a little more challenging"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Super Comfort, Style and Sound","The Sennheiser HD-555 Headphones are quite simply amazing.  I've heard mention before of comparing headphones and speakers to cars and racing bikes, where a bike costing in the mid thousands is capable of outperforming cars costing well over ten times that amount.  This comparison couldn't be truer here. "
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Best burner in my opinion,"All this has been said before but here it is again. Sony 1-8x DVD+R's with ""AccuCORE"" will burn at 16x. TDK 8x will only burn at 8x. Wherever you buy this buy it OEM. Save the money for a better version of Nero Burning ROM. Bundled retail software is junk. I've had mine for months now and burned most every format on DVDs and Cd's. No coasters. It's quite but you can here it run. It has a busy light. If it's on it's busy. Firmware updates for media are readily available. Present version is 1.06. You can buy this under $50 and it works great with my AMD 1.4Ghz and Windows 98SE.  "
electronics,7 of 11,2.0,Didn't Deliver,"I replaced the 97 cent splitter that I bought at the store. I expected better or at the very least the same level of performance. I use this between my computer and TV. My bandwidth dropped from ~2mbs to ~400kbs. I thought I had hooked it up wrong, so I checked it. No dice, I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because it looks nice and my TV picture is the same or a little better. Wish I had my $ back"
electronics,18 of 18,5.0,Near perfect protection for my Palm Z22. I love it.  (4.5 stars),I'm a stay-at-home Mom and my Palm Z22 is helping me tremendously at home. I got the Flexi Case for it as I felt it was the most appropriate for my needs and it was inexpensive to buy. I'm glad I did and been very happy with the Flexi case. 
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,"Cute appearance, poor quality...","For the price, I would have expected a little bit better quality of a product from Apple.  The first sock that I used for my iPod promptly got a hole in it, from very little (and GENTLE) use.  I guess that's why they sell them in 6-packs...so you can just toss one out and use the next one...but for almost $5 apiece, they are not a good value"
electronics,2 of 10,1.0,car clip killed 20GB ipod nano,"Well dont trust this car clip,I did and my ipod went out the car window hit the Sydney Harbour Bridge  bounced hit a city bound train bounced back onto the road with my car driving over it as I was looking out my revision mirror I could see all the cars driving over it..I dont recommend one of these.I do recommend buying an Apple ipod 20GB Nano as they are so cool"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best Price I've Seen On the Internet,I've used about 65 out of 100 and so far not one bad disc. Best price for 100 DVD disc on the net that I've seen
electronics,,1.0,NOT U3 - Not as described,"This drive is described as a U3, but it is not. Amazon is misleading us with their listing."
electronics,3 of 8,5.0,I'd be lost without it,The TomTom GO 300 did a great job navigating me around an unfamiliar city.  I'd be lost without it for sure.  I would recommend anyone getting this.  It saved so much time I would have devoted to reading maps had I not had it
electronics,23 of 33,5.0,no surprises here,"It's a can of compressed air and when you pull the trigger it shoots air out.  There's not really much that could go wrong with a deal like this.  I have a can of this on my desk as we speak and I use it to blow dust off of my electronics equipment.  It works.  It's also fun to shoot at the dog or the pet bird.  Beware though as it comes out cold and could freeze certain organic surfaces, such as an eyeball, if applied too long.  So don't go aiming it at your eyeball, or your dog's eyeball and you should be fine.  Aim it at your cat's eyeball if you want because cats are sinister"
electronics,16 of 16,2.0,Great Idea -- Bad Execution!,The Good:
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,The Ultra II is fast between snaps,I am using this SD card and in my canon SD 600 and the time lapse between two consecutive shots are really fast. Its really worth to have a 2GB Ultra card ...it allows to take over 800 snaps in the highest resolution.
electronics,,5.0,A very impressive keyboard,"I bought both the Natual Multimedia Keyboard and Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000, and must say that I like this one much better than the bestseller Ergo 4000."
electronics,2 of 9,1.0,terrible!,"Bad bad bad.  I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs, whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable.  I purchased a 50 spindle and from the first 28 used only one worked properly.  This is an expensive waste.  I suggest going with better quality discs at the outset.  It will save on headache later"
electronics,,5.0,Great Product,This little case is slim and light weight yet protects my IPAQ perfectly! I did not get one immediately - my IPAQ screen got cracked - now it is protected! Dont make the same mistake I did and get one of these to protect your invesment
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Don't bother,"I received this as a Christmas gift and had to return.  Was not compatible and couldn't load on a brand new computer.  Software gave no ability to customize the installation.  No help from the Nat. Geo website support.  Went thru the entire install and at last bar.....sorry, disc couldn't finalize hit finish to continue and it kicks you out completely to start over again."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Never again,"Four months ago, I used this product and had no problems except the finished CDs did not play in one person's car player. With this stack every one of the first 15 CDs I made did not play in most equipment, although they played in the recorder where I copied them. It was very disconcerting to put them in other players and get nothing, or get something only after forwarding to the 3rd track. Didn't understand why this was happening. But I'll not buy them again. It was a waste of many hours since I was assuming they worked"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Not worth the money,"I bought this item to attach dual monitors to my laptop.  Since I already had one flat panel monitor, I bought another one for $300 and the dualhead to go for $155.  I checked the compatability Maxtor tool to see if it will work with my Dell Latitude X1.  It passed the compatibility test.  The installation worked like a breeze but the monitor output of 2048x780 was less than stellar.  It hurts your eyes.  Also, dialog boxes open across the two screens and that can be a pain too.  Unless you have a graphic chipset with a higher resolution, I would save my money.  Better tool is to buy a regular desk top computer with dual monitor card (costs less than $20) and you will be much happier. Or get a synchronizing tool for keeping your laptop and desktop up to date.  Or, bite the bullet and buy a large monitor.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great ink,"Amazon has a good price for true canon ink. I've been buying mine's locally (not sure why in the past I didn't think of checking on Amazon.)  For reviewer's comments on the ""P"" version of the ink, Some (not all) canon printers use BOTH the Cyan, Magenta and Photo Cyan and Photo Magenta ink cartridges. If your printer only uses 4 ink cartridges you probably should NOT be using PC or PM. If you have a printer with 6 ink cartridges then PC and PM are two additional required ones.  Whats the difference? The PC and PM are a different shade of Cyan and Magenta which allows the more expensive 6 color printers to be a bit more granular in the shades of color they can produce in your photos so they can be a little more accurate compared to the four color printers."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,It's just a toy--don't expect a real instrument,"Mnay reviewers have stated their diappointment in this guitar when they purchase it for a child to learn to actually play. Don't do that. It is not built correctly or scaled properly to hold a standard tuning. This guitar works well for my 3-year-old girl who wants a guitar ""like daddy's"", but she's 3 and not really learning how to play a guitar. It may be good for very basic concepts, but when the time comes to teach her how to play one, I will get her a sanely-priced, real child's-scale instrument from a real manufacturer (email me for suggestions if interested) and teach her to play. "
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,NOT optical mouse friendly,"Totally agree with the other reviewers who said that this pad does not work with an optical mouse.  I tried it with the one that comes with  MicroSoft's ""standard"" wireless combo and the on-screen cursor does not move at all."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Absolutely Great!,"This case is fantastic for the 5G 30GB Ipod.  It completly covers the ipod when closed.  I too was concerned about the lack of a screen cover, but after the first use, it isn't needed as the flip design of the case protects the ipod.  I tried the Speck skin tight case first, it did fit at all.  The DLO case cured my problems.  It looks fantastic too"
electronics,5 of 8,5.0,Simple... Cheap.,Great product.  Simply use the USB that your Ipod Came with and you have a portable charger. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Nice labels, work as promised.","These DVDs print very nicely on my Epson inkjet printer. They seem to burn nicely, and work fine. Highly recommended"
electronics,10 of 12,1.0,Dead after a few months,"As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better"
electronics,7 of 7,2.0,Crash and Burn,"I put this card in my wife's Dell Inspiron 4000 Laptop. It replaced a NetGear 802.11b card. Worked great! Then the Blue Screens of Death started. I have tried different combos of using Window's XP to control the card (against recommendations but is more stable) and using different versions of the software for both the card and NetGear's controlling software to no avail. I am now down to the last attempt, using Window's updated software for the card with Windows controlling the card. We'll see. "
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,"Might want to try before you buy (although with headphones, that's easier said than done)","First, the good: Sound quality. I'm no expert regarding headphones, but I had no issues with the sound on these."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Owen10,At $199.99 you can't go wrong for a 30 Gig. Mp3 player with video playback..plus free shipping and $20 in free credit...what is not to like about this nice looking mp3 player
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Computer Clean Up,"It is a great gadget to keep the tower off the floor, allowing for easy moving and cleaning without sticking to carpet or scratching a wood floor. And it is lightweight and looks especially fashionable with a black tower (think Dell)"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works with OLD items PLUS differentiates between Tivos!,"Items the remote is now working on: RCA TV, Toshiba VCR, Sony DVD player, Sony CD player, Sansui audio tuner (really OLD), and Tivo. (We still have the option to expand to 2 more devices. We also have a second Tivo, but our setup allows the remote to differentiate between the Tivo signals.)"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,SUPER SONY speakers.,The sound quality is excellent.  The price is very reasonable for the pair.  I don't know why anyone would what bigger unless they what to impair their hearing. Service was fast also.  Thank's  Victo
electronics,14 of 27,1.0,Shipped wrong product &amp; didn't refund shiping,"I ordered the 512M xD when it was cheaper than the current price, but they shipped me a 256M card instead.  They said that it was a price mistake and to return the product for a full refund, which was find with me, but they did not refund the shipping!  I can understand if I ordered the wrong product, but this was their error yet they still expect me to pay for their mistake?"
electronics,,5.0,"ZERO ERRORS, a perfect product",I think those who are complaining have broken drives or computers.  I have been using these for about a year with zero defects
electronics,16 of 24,1.0,Ha You think this dock charges your Ipod? Think again.,Why waste the money?  I bought two of these - one for a 10G IPod and one for a 15G IPod - it charges neither.  The box even states that it will not charge these models but you don't see that in the advertisements now do you
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,love it,I've had this mouse for about a month and it is very comfortable and responsive. it looks cool too. I have about 4 different mice I use all day and this is my favorite
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,"Getting me an ""A"" in my history classes","This is a great product for college students to use during lecture classes. I have found it very helpful in my history courses in which I am expected to understand what is important to take notes on during an hour lecture when the tests are not for weeks or sometimes a month later. This item requires no skill to operate; you simply plug and record. The only downside is that it picks up every sound, even the hard drive spinning up. This is not a good device for quality sound recording, rather it is good to get a basic recording. That it why I recommend this product for college students. It will improve your grades if you actually listen to the lectures after you record them"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Vantec Lapcool3,This product works just as I expected it too. Keeps my laptop cool so it does not feel like it is overheating. Price was right also
electronics,5 of 14,1.0,Item was DOA,"Much to my dismay, the item arrived DOA, and even tech support was not readily available. I eventually filed an RMA with the seller, but I had to pay for return shipping costs. There apparently is no such thing as ""quality control"" from the seller in an item as simple as this, and for this I rate this item such. While the replacement works, I would recommend others to not buy this until they have tried the age-old ""soap water"" solution first"
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,What a ripoff!,"I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless:"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"A bit bulky, but it's all good","As a journalist, I need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever I went. Now, with the Zen's microphone/recording feature, I'm able to use it to record my interviews, and it's easier to transcribe because of its clear, crisp recording quality."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,There is nothing wrong with this product....,"BUT you have to follow the directions to the letter. Yes, it can be a little trouble to set up, but once it is, it's great. I have had no issues whatsoever with my G310 and enjoy being able to print to my remote printer (HP 2550L) without having to move my laptop around. I do have a D-Link router and I think that does make the process easier. The instructions shared in a review a few below me are accurate and will help. I only gave it 4 stars because it does take some work to set up"
electronics,9 of 22,2.0,DEFINENTLY Not Worth It,"I looked at it on the internet and for some reason I thought it was an amazing idea. Actually, its very useless. I thought that it would be really good because it has a line out plug in it which allows you to play music while its plugged in...well it can do that without it. Anyway for some reason my computer doesn't even allow it to play while its plugged in. I used to be able to have it plugged in yet be able to play music. Now it just shows either the &quot;Do Not Disconnect&quot; sign or the &quot;you can disconnect now&quot; sign. I don't know whats wrong but I don't like it and I don't want my dock connector"
electronics,11 of 16,1.0,PAP2 is locked into Vonage,There are dozens of service providers out there with different options but the PAP2 is locked to Vonage.  You can't use any other provider unless you can get the unlock password from Vonage (which they won't give you) and reprogram your PAP2.  Buy the PAP2-NA instead which isn't locked
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Quick release clip for eTrex,"In reading the reviews on the Bicycle Mounting Adapter.  There seems to be one negative that most agree on.  Replacing of the better quality back cover that comes on the eTrex, for the cheaper and questionable one that has the quick release clip for the handle bar mounting adapter. "
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Disappointed,"I received these as a birthday gift a year ago last August.  I wanted a pair of wireless headsets to use while I sew.  They were very comfortable. I loved the cushioned ear pads and fit around my head.  I admit my transmitter was located  near me when I used them, so I rarely had difficulty recieving sound (except when the batteries were starting to fail).  When I moved through my home, they cracked a bit and would re-tune themselves.  I live in a 60 X 12 trailer.  So, that's not saying anything great about being able to move around.  My biggest dissapointment is that they have died on me.  I called support to get help.  Of course, the person I spoke to sounded like they were sitting in outer space trying to help me....they were so far away I couldn't understand what they were saying.  Our conversation ended with these conclusions: my headset did not work, will not work, are no longer under any warranty and there was no where to take them to repare them.  If the gift was only $35 I would not fret.  However, these were bought at a chain store for $129.  I had someone who knows a bit about electronics look at them; The multifunction button is to blame for the malfunction.  So, if you can purchase these for next to nothing, they are a great purchase.  I wouldn't spend more than $30 on them"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,No problems,This card has worked perfect with no problems since I got it around a year ago.  I was going to get some no-name card but I've read about problems with cards like that.  I ended getting a D-Link router (the 604) since this card worked so well and that has been great too
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,The best PMP I've seen,"I'm a semi-professional photographer whose dSLR takes Compact Flash cards, and so I was very excited at the prospects of using the Vision W as a way to offload images from shoots (using the compact flash slot) and to free them back up so that I could continue shooting. "
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Be very careful,"I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work"
electronics,,5.0,Know where the enemy is.,"I was skeptical at first that a sound card could improve my gaming ability, but I was amazed at how much of a difference it makes. I've had it for one day and already I've noticed much better response time sound-wise. I'm able to hear my opponents from further away and locate them easier as well. I play counter-strike source regularly, and my teammates have already begun to ask my how I know where the enemy is so quickly. This is a great enhancement to my gaming experience and I would recommend it to anyone who demands the best in gaming"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,This phone has it all!,"I actually needed only a wall phone for the kitchen than also had caller ID.  This unit has an answering system as well, so I got rid of my 20-year old answering machine to boot. Having a speakerphone system is perfect for handsfree duties in the kitchen and the volume control goes pretty high.  The instruction book is well written and easy to follow - I had to refer to it once to determine how to call in remotely to pick up my messages.  It's very easy to change set paramters such as the outgoing message or number of rings as well.  Good buy"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,This One Will Stay,"I previously purchased the Wireless PilotBoard but returned it due to wireless interference.  After much research, I wanted a black keyboard with soft keytouch and no noise. I decided to try Kensington again. I didn't need the Internet features on a keyboard so the 104 keys Comfort Type is closely standard. My fingers rest comfortably on the angled keys as if natural. I don't have to have my elbows close to my body. Only the main and function keys are angled.  The number pad, arrows, and cursor position keys are not angled but is no disappointment.  Lastly, I don't understand why the |\ key had to be re-arranged, the shift key shorten and the backspace key longer. It's a minor adjustment to make as a touch typist.  Overall, I'm pleased with this keyboard"
electronics,,1.0,Cheap wireless speaker,"I had a very bad experience with this product.  The signal would fade in and out even if I was relatively close to the source signal.  When the signal faded out an annoying static sound would take its place.  My parents have Indoor/Outdoor Wireless speakers that work great.  This product has a nice price, but does not perform"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,A big step forward from DVP642,"Philips DVD players are my most favorite for two reasons, 1. they are cheap and 2. they can play DIVX and can be made region free gracefully. I am user of DVP642 for last one year and even though I enjoyed the flexibility of playing all sort of DVD/DivX files thru it, I never liked the picture quality/menu browsing much. Now, with this new model, menu browsing is much faster, discs loads way faster and not too mention picture quality also improved greatly."
electronics,7 of 9,5.0,Great speaker wire to work with,"I started out with lamp cord cable from Radio Shack (they called it speaker cable). It was very rigid cable which made it a pain to work with. Short of stapling it to the floor, I don't think it would stay close to the wall. It was also a very bright gold color and stuck out like a sore thumb."
electronics,,4.0,Nice Design,"Works well and the retractable cord tidys up the cord clutter.  The plug slips out of my auto charger though (cigarette lighter), you have to make sure that the plug is in tight and that the iPod is actually charging. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Damned good!,I really have only a few observations about this that are less than stellar:
electronics,,5.0,Awesome keyboard,"I am really enjoying this keyboard. It's thin & has lots of fun little buttons to program for your convenience. Cordless comes in handy for relaxed time at the desk. Little struggle for MMORPGing, but if you're resourceful enough you can manage. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,IGNORE THE 5 STARS,"okay, i had a glowing review for this product previously, but i've changed my mind after months of use. the sound is really, really, really loud, but your vocal timbre will be different, almost like extremely loud quality from a laptop speaker... some people found the sound to be buzzy and scrambled."
electronics,,5.0,Great wireless headphones. FINALLY!!,I owned the previous version of logitech's wireless headphones and now I got the freepulse version. Wow! These headphones look great!! The sound is terrific and so far no interference when I put it in my jacket. The headset is very light weight and doesn't hurt my ears like the previous version. Did I mention these headphones look cool? The built quality is great.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Matte paper review,Great paper-The Epson printer worked just fine and the images on this paper were just like the photograph-Only thing is the price!!!!Should be lower-other than that this is GREAT pape
electronics,,4.0,I am happy with this product,"I am happy with this product,  it was easy to set up. The software is user-friendly. The touch pad is sensitive , takes some getting used to. If you put it in your pocket , and then pull it out , you end up touching the key pad and changing something.  A case would probably eliminate this problem.  The sound is good and the price is good"
electronics,,5.0,"Great Stand for my 61"" tv","I love the look and design of the stand. It was a bit tricky lining things up when I put it together, but after undoing and redoing it, it came out fine."
electronics,,4.0,Accessable USB 2 Ports,For my older PC this made it easy to access a USB 2 port without crawling around to the back of the computer. It does require power for full functionality but does just what I need it to do for a reasonable price
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Alternative,"This product has absolutely no problems with it. I use this instead of Apple's $30 charger which works the same as this. It's a great wall charger, never overheats, and works perfectly with my 5g 30 gig iPod video. I can't say how great this product really is. Definately is worth every cent (haha)"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Easy to install and use,I just purchased the Dymo LabelWriter and it was easy to install and use.  So far it's been great

electronics,16 of 16,5.0,successor to the legendary xr55!,"...what it has that the xr55 does not: HDMI, dual-amping of front mains now available during 5.1 playback, one extra set of component inputs, and all-channel stereo (called ""party mode"" on other receivers).  "
electronics,,5.0,DVD +R/RW,"I have had excellent results transferring my VHS Tapes(movies, etc.)to Memorex DVD+R/RW discs. I have a Philips DVDR985 DVD Recorder/Player and it will only record on DVD+R/RW discs. I have been through several other manufacturers +R/RW discs and none were as reliable as Memorex(and, of course Philips). I ran into a problem recording on the +R disc, however, that was due to a problem with the Recorder. I just bought another 50 DVD+RW Memorex discs(2-25 disc spindles) and when they run out I will still go for Memorex."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,AT&T Handset,This is exactly the same phone I ordered from AT&T at about half the price.  I am very happy with it and the quick delivery
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very Very good,Just as advertised.
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,comfortable and functional,"i bought this for my mother so she could use skype.  i had one for myself so i knew it was good.  very comfortable for hours of gaming as well.  highly adjustable and the volume control on the unit is a good feature.  the sound is very clear.  the only (very minor) problem is the tiny mute switch on the unit sometimes gets slid to the ""mute"" position by accident (and i don't realize it).  other than that, this is a great value"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Decent! Which was a surprise.,"I decided to give these ear buds a shot.  I normally despise ear buds, but I recently started a corporate job where my over-the-ear set produced too much over-flow noise for a co-worker.  For a while, I tried to cope with the ear pain associated with the iPod ear buds, but it started driving me up the walls."

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,I can now connect from the back patio!,"Had belkin router ""g"" series previously, but sometimes could not connect in the family room.  Now i can connect anywhere inside or outside my home.  Set up was easy.  My router is in an upstairs closet, but the design with the icon lights is so cool, i'm tempted to move it to my desktop"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Does what it says,This case looks very good on the outside. In fact you can't really see it! It protects the Z22 very well and prevents scratches. the case gets scratched itself though. So you might want to put a screen protector on it too to keep it looking nice
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,This TV is awesome!,This in an outstanding DLP television.  Picture is still bright and clear from side angles.  The HD TV picture is very good.  The menus are simple and easy to navigate.  We are very happy with our purchase
electronics,,5.0,sleek and durable with many functions,"I am very pleased with this calculator, worth the money"
electronics,120 of 123,5.0,How many pictures will it store?,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  "
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Haven't burned a coaster yet,"I have used these DVD+Rs for over two years now and they work absolutely great. I have burned movies, games, files, everything. Haven't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the DVD players I tried them out on."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent Choice for Upconverting DVD Recorder,"The video quality is phenomenal when viewing uupconverted standard resolution DVDs through the HDMI connection at 1080i or even 720p. This unit has all the features I needed, including Dual Layer recording and SD card picture viewing and slideshow recording. It is easy to set up and burns all of the media I have tried on it, from expensive archival quality to throw away cheap DVD-R disks. The Quick Start recording feature is fantastic, taking no more than 1 second to go from off to recording. All of the features operate as advertised which is a breath of fresh air in this day of overhype marketing. I highly recommend this item."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good product.,"I got some problems during installation, but the technical support from D-Link and Qwest did a good job solving the problems"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Exceeds expectations,"I bought this GPS principally for fishing/camping trips.  What I didn't realize is that it's actually an OK automobile navigator as well.  No voice prompts, and the mapping screen is a little small.  But still very usable."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,amazing,"i recently received this so i could share my ""tunes"" from my iPod with my sister while traveling on an airplane to florida, and it works really well. Great sound quality, no difference noted... Buy this if you are looking for a splitter. "
electronics,4 of 22,4.0,I LUV THIS THING!!!,"BUT; U KANT TAKE THE DVDs U'VE RECORDED ON THE SONY RDR-GX7 AND EDIT THEM IN YOUR PC. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'M USING THE WRONG SOFTWARE. MAYBE I'LL TRY ADOBE LIVE MOTION INSTEAD OF SONIC'S MyDVD SOFTWARE THAT CAME WITH MY SONY DRU-500A RW DRIVE IN MY PC. BUT EVEN WITH THIS LITTLE DRAWBACK, I JUST LUV THIS THING. I RECORD THREE SHOWS OFF OF TVLAND EVERYDAY WHICH IN TOTAL IS THREE HOURS LONG. I RECORD THEM EACH IN LP MODE AND MY PICTURE QUALITY STILL SEEMS HARDLY SACRAFICED. I BOUGHT IT IN MAY-2004 FOR $498. IT SURE BEAT THE $799 PRICE TAG SONY HAD ON IT AT THEIR OWN WEBSITE. I WOULDN'T TRADE THIS THING FA NUTTN!!"
electronics,,2.0,"Great at first, but has a short existence.","I've gone through two of these Altec Lansing headsets. Upon the first day of purchase and shortly thereafter, it's a great headset--but they die fast. "
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Super mini speaker for laptops/mp3 players,This Creative Labs Travelsound i300 speaker system is awesome.
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Bulky! not what i hoped for,"after shopping around for wirless headphones for my mp3 player i went with the creative digital wireless headphones, i have a creative labs zen touch mp3 player. the headphones themselves are bulky and fit really funny, they do not stay on your head unless you are sitting very still. the audio sounds great, great bass, but if you are 10 feet or more away from your source yo get a static noise that sounds like a loose cable. for the prce these are ok for indoor use. i returned mine the nxt day i got them, very unhappy with them"
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Beware of installation problems,"I bought this unit as a perfect addition to my computer music writing - but it will not install on my Compaq Presario computer. After many weeks back and forth with Griffin Tech Support and HP/Compaq Support, and postings online, still no success. It installs in minutes on other computers, and other Compaqs, but not mine. Time for a refund which Griffin is happy to provide. 5 stars for Griffin Tech Support, though"
electronics,5 of 12,5.0,"Great graphics , excellent performance",A very clear monitor that rivals the best in the industry. The image quality is excellent. Definately worth buyin
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Incredible Printer!,"This printer is literally this simple:  Take it out of the box, plug it in, put in your memory card from your camera and start printing.  You will have gorgeous pictures just that fast.  We highly recommend it"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Great for the Money,"These headphones are far more comfortable than any others I've tried.  The sound is quite good, and the range is amazing.  I can go downstairs and not lose any clarity or quality."
electronics,,4.0,Things to consider if you're getting a 2GB card,"I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone."
electronics,6 of 7,1.0,This fax will self-destruct in one year....,"Aside from the horrible speaker, which reduces phone messages to nearly indecipherable gargling sounds, this fax appears to be pre-programmed to self-destruct within a year.  A few days after the warranty expired, our machine lost its ability to maintain a stable phone line connection (and the problem is not with the phone line).  Furthermore, when we try to use it for copying it consistently fails with a ""paper jam"" error, even though there is nothing of the kind.  Naturally, I'm really glad I bought the now worthless 1 year replacement package as well.  What a total waste of $140.  If you're in the market for a reliable fax, I'd look further than this fragile toy"
electronics,8 of 9,4.0,Review for New York City,"All, just got the Nuvi 360 as a gift from GREEAAATT friends for my birthday. "
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Fantastic 2-line phone,"I love this phone. It improves significantly over the previous Uniden models I've had. The speakerphone is clear at both ends. The buttons are well lit and easy to use. The phone book can actually be copied to other phones. The speakerphone in each handset cannot be overrated. In our case we can listen to a conversation between our 2 year old and the grandparents to help translate and our daughter doesn't have to keep the phone perfectly placed on her head. I like to use handheld speakerphone when the headset becomes annoying and I still want to roam the house. The base station is fairly compact too. 5.8Ghz doesn't static around my wireless laptop or microwave as many people promised. My only real complaint is that the ring tones are limited. Since each line can have a different ring tone (per phone unit) the ring tones seem even more limited.  Again, for the parents out there, my daughter loves the Old MacDonald ring tone"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Solid phone when it works, buy through Amazon","I now have three of these extra handsets working in addition to my base phone. However, 2 of them cut out on me and had to be replaced. The screen just went blank. I replaced with the recommended new batteries but no luck. Now I have extra batteries."
electronics,16 of 17,2.0,"Great Features vs Slight Flaws Makes This Skin Just ""Okay""","I previously owned an iSkin for my 4th Generation Click Wheel, and I was in love with it. My iPod was completely impervious - never a nick or ding to be found once it entered its skin and screen, which I never had to fuss with."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Lots of cheap memory,This card works flawlessly in my canon S3IS digital still camera.  It appears well made
electronics,8 of 11,2.0,Foam Earpieces Wear Out Quickly,"This is my 2nd pair of these headphones, on my first pair the foam ear pieces wore out, and since these are Sony, their are no replacements for them.  So I bought a brand new set of headphones and now these ear pieces have worn out.  They lasted about a year each time.  I'm going to try the Jensen behind the ear headphones this time and see if the foam lasts longer"
electronics,3 of 6,4.0,My cat loves this toy,"I bought this cat for my 5-month old male kitten who plays very hard. He sprints across the floor and tumbles with the FurReal cat, biting it and otherwise violating the mechanical cat in every imaginable way. The FurReal cat simply purrs or inclines its head and meows, which riles poor Binks into more furious attacks.  When they both lift their tails and hiss at each other it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys. The best part is that I'm not getting bit as much as before! I personally recommend this toy for cats as well as children"
electronics,15 of 15,5.0,Much better than the Panasonic battery,I think the Panasonic expandable cordless phone systems are great... I've used several of them at home and at work for the last two years.  
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Generally a good purchase,"Overall, we are quite pleased with our purchase of the base unit and three additional handsets.  Quite simple to install."
electronics,,5.0,Most Reviews Here  Are Not for This Card,"This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second."
electronics,8 of 21,1.0,Check availability of replacement lamp,"Before buying a Panasonic projector, try to find a replacement lamp in stock somewhere! I have been waiting over two months for a back ordered ET-LAB10 lamp. No one seems to have any"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Nice Quality and Price,The Plus paper is very close to the Pro in quality and Amazon's price is very attractive.  Highly recommended
electronics,,2.0,FM transmitter for iPod,"Very poor performance in most populated area. I have tried to remove the car antenna but the result is far below a real FM station, despite the flexibility in channel choic"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Even better than expected,"I managed to set it up in less than 15 minutes, most of that was getting my wiring untangled."
electronics,,5.0,Great mouse for the money,"I purchased this mouse to use with a laptop computer I recently purchased.  I did have a couple of compatibility issues, but those were quickly solved with a simple phone call to Logitech.  The Logitech setup software is easy to use and understand, and it makes this mouse extremely flexible.  The laser tracking system is wonderful and allows you to use the mouse on almost any surface.  I especially like the back and email buttons, the volume controls and scroll wheel this mouse has built in.  These save considerable effort because Logitech puts them at your fingertips. No more hunting for the cursor or controls while surfing the web, and your email is only a push of a button away."
electronics,,4.0,Frees up your hands plus no need to dial from base!,"We have been using this product for at least 4 years now.  This is our 3rd replacement though!  I love the headset since it is the only one that I've found which enables you to make calls without having to go back to a 'base' unit.  You just hook the unit on your pocket, belt, or top of your pants then put the headset on and away you go!  You have the option of setting up the headset over your ear, or over your head (less pain!).  I love the quality of the calls, but my complaint would be that this unit breaks easily.  I wish there were no cord from the headset to the unit (not the base) since I keep catching the cord on my cabinet or draw knobs as I walk around and yank the whole phone of my head and pants!  The problem we have experienced is usually with the cord attached the headset to the unit or with the headset itself.  They are a bit flimsy and the cord wears down a lot with use.  I would still purchase this set - again, because I haven't found a comparable product with these options.  I did see a new product on the market which seems comparable (GN7170) but haven't tried. We also tried the plantronics CS50 - with handset lifter but found that to be a pain since you need to go to your base or handset to dial a phone number.  Bottom line?  I would recommend this product"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Super Smooth!,This is a great mouse. Smooth is all I have to say. The best feeling mouse that I've felt in a long time
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Does what it is supposed to do,"I bought this memory stick for my Sony Cybershot, and it does the job perfectly. It's nice that it has the MemoryStick Pro adapter, since my camera does not take MemoryStick Duo."
electronics,,5.0,Good quality and best value,I bought the card from Amazon.com and have used for several months. It is fast and stable
electronics,,5.0,"Good product, beware of rebate","This is my first wireless network card.  It works without problems and was easy to set up.  It also is compatible with the Netgear router in our home.  However, the $10 rebate offer was not honored by the company that processes the rebates.  Their excuse was that I purchased the product from an invalid retailer.  This is very funny, since I downloaded the rebate from Amazon itself and Amazon was advertising the rebate offer also"
electronics,,4.0,Exactly what I needed,"I read many reviews before I bought my iTrip and they made me very wary. I have to say I am more than pleased with the performance of my iTrip and I have not had many of the problems I read about, with one exception. The iTrip is a battery drainer. I too get around 3 hours of use before I have to plug it up. 99% of the time the sound is perfect and I hear no static at all. Occasionally when I'm in the car and I pass a certain spot in town I hear some static, but it's no big deal for me. I originally bought it b/c I had a 10 hr road trip ahead of me. I didn't want to carry a bunch of CDs but I wanted the variety I had on my Nano. It worked beautifully! Now I use it in the car, in the office or anywhere I can find a radio. It has definitely improved the functionality of my Nano"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Awesome GPS, Average Radio","I bought the Rhino 120 for Hiking with my Daughter &amp; we also ride quads &amp; motorcycles on remote trails.  The GPS was simply awesome.  Accurate &amp; easy to use the basic features, their are alot of features &amp; I am still working on learning them.  The basics are easy to learn so you don't get lost &amp; it is easy to find your way back with the tracking &amp; waypoints.  We used the radio, however it did not seem to work that well with other brand FRS radio's.  The range was very limited, but this may not be Rhino's fault, but rather the different brands of radio's, I did not get the opportunity to give a good range test on GMRS.  Anyway, my riding buddy was so impressed he is going to get one as well.  I am pleased"
electronics,5 of 8,1.0,"SkyGolf support is terrible, save your money","I was an early purchaser of the SkyCaddie.  I thought it worked just ""okay"" until my buddie bought one (after playing a round with mine)and, standing side by side with our two SkyCaddies, his satelite reception was 4 bars vs my 1 bar, and his yardages was always 5 or 6 yards different then mine.  Upon calling Skygolf, they said it must be my firmware that needed updating.  Well, it's been two weeks after they received my unit and still no status on when I'm getting it back."
electronics,7 of 12,5.0,I love this mp3 player!,This was my first Mp3 player I have ever boughten and I have not regretted buying it.  I should have gotten screen protectors for since the screen is a tad scratched up now but that was my fault so it's okay.
electronics,,2.0,Not perfect for anybody,"I don't know exactly who these were designed for. I'm a DJ, and tried using them for both spinning & home use. I found:"
electronics,,4.0,Very good,"This is great and it's small enough where you can carry one around in a bag if you're at different locations.  It really offers excellent support.  My only zing is that the bottom doesn't really grip down to the desktop very well, so it tends to slide around a bit which can be annoying. "
electronics,,5.0,best tablet for photographers,"Having the Wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures.  It is the best investment I have made lately in my business.  It saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other over-use/strain problems related with high mouse useage.  I can be much more precise on my work in photoshop! I would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers ""must have list"""
electronics,4 of 12,1.0,Very Poor Quality,"The unit worked as it should.  But the quality is very bad.  After I left the unit sitting around for a month or so, the GPS' battery discharge by itself.  In order to get it running again, I have to recharge it and then reboot the device with a pin.  I had to reboot the unit a few times already.  After using the GPS for a few times, the voice is not functioning; no voice guidance.  Then the backlit for the screen malfunctioned.  The screen cannot be seen without the backlit.  Amazingly, the backlit came back to life after a few months of rest.  As of now, the voice is still mute."
electronics,12 of 13,5.0,Perfect for Garmin GPSmap 60CSx and City Navigator v8,I got this chip for my new Garmin 60CSx GPSmap handheld receiver.
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,great for about 2 months,"I bought this controller to use with Doom on my laptop.  The configuration is excellent and installation was very easy.  However, about 2 months later the left joystick acted up and moves me forward without even touching it.  I reinstalled the software, recalibrated several times, and I still creep forward even when I'm not touching the joystick.  It's impossible to get my character to stand still.  I can adjust to this when I'm playing the actual game, but it's impossible to scroll through menus and such when the joystick is constantly moving ""up"".  Anyway, I'm shopping for another controller later today.."
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,"Sleek, but can't run component in and HDMI out.","I needed HDMI to run a long cord to a plasma.  If you run HDMI out, you need to use HDMI in.  This is fine, but there is only one HDMI in.  How do you hook your cable and DVD into one input?... Well I'll probably get a $200 HDMI switch.  But for now I'm running my cable through my HDMI DVD player.  When I get my Hi-def signal hooked up, I don't know if I want to route that through a DVD player that will do who knows what"

One other plus id for once the software bundle was useful and not a bunch of cheap bloatware (hear that H.P. we do not all want bloadware)."
electronics,25 of 26,4.0,"Great system, with just a few issues","I replaced all of the 'phones in my home with one base unit and 4 handsets. I love the fact that I can place a fully functional 'phone with access to both of my 'phone lines anywhere there's a electrical outlet. My 2nd 'phone line is wired only to my home office, so I placed the base unit there and now I can pick up the 2nd line anywhere in my home."

electronics,,5.0,Logitech Mediaplay Cordless Mouse-Blue,"I personally really like this mouse.It has a nice feel to it,the responsiveness feels just right to me not too much or too little it's also real nice not to have the wire accross the keyboard.I hope you never stop making this model,I know sometimes companies will discontinue an older model when they come out with a new one,but like I said I really like this one just the way it is.Based on my experiencnce so far I would definitly buy other prducts of yours,also the customer service from amazon has been excellent.Thank you keep up the good work.Bil"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Mid/Bass/Treble Just Riiigggghhhhttttt,This is simple. The sound is balanced. If you want booming bass ... go someplace else that puts out artificial sound. This is where the bass should be ... not overpowering everything else

electronics,1 of 6,5.0,Best product,"I am very glad i purchased this and that too from Amazon, I just love the service i get from Amazon ."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Saved me $$$,"I was looking for large GB jump drives to take on vacation w/ me to download my camera cards onto.  then i thought ""i wonder if i can put them on my iPod?"" and found this little gizmo.  It's the bomb! i love it & it stays in my camera bag along w/ the iPod USB Travel Power Charger Adapter. If my camera goes this goes w/ my iPod! a definate must have. (as usual, Amazon has the best price."
electronics,,4.0,Pretty Good Overall,"This is overall a pretty good flash drive.  It is affordable and has one gigabyte of memory.  That is probably enough for someone who doesn't want to keep every little thing they've ever saved on it.  It takes a little bit for it to transfer the data, but no biggie unless your really short on time.  Comes with a cap to put on the top (some flash drives don't).  It also comes with a string to tie around your neck.  Overall an economic choice for a person who needs to carry around data without carrying a bulky diskette"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,The best mp3 player out there,"I bought this baby almost 2 years ago after doing extensive research on all the mp3 players out there. I'm convinced that people only buy the ipod because it is the best advertized and, therefore, trendiest. However, the iRiver puts the ipod to shame. Not only is it an mp3 player, but it is also an external harddrive. That means you can hold any files you want on it. If you want to transfer 10 movies from one computer to another, just drag em onto the iRiver and it's that simple. For those of you who want to know about the recording function (that the ipod does NOT have), I just bootlegged a concert last week. I was in the middle of the audience and I just used the external microphone it comes with, and the recording came out great for an audience recording! I had to boost up the volume a bit with a wav editing program, but the sound quality was good and clear without any maxing out. And you can record it either wav or mp3 format. Besides that, the battery life is great. The size is basically identical to the ipod, except the ipod is all white and feminine, while the iRiver is black and cooler looking with a sick blue LCD screen. All in all, if you want the best price for the best player out there, get the iRiver"

electronics,5 of 10,5.0,"A few Problems, but Otherwise Works Great.","Someone complained about the POP and LASER modes. If you want pop protection, too bad--at the moment, there is no radar detector that does that. If you want true laser protection, consider the Escort's Radar Shifter; do a Google search for results. About the horn, mine did that, but after a week, all issues went away. Perhaps it was adjusting to temperature changes, but all I know is I have no more problems. Don't be so whiny-- I am always on alert around me. POP is bogus for the most part, but I still leave it on. A little extra noise is better than a not-so-small ticket."
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,S-l-o-o-o-w,"Others have commented on the major weaknesses of this phone, but I'll add my own pet peeve: everything is so bl**dy SLOW! To scroll down through the phone book feels like click-pause-click-pause-click-pause.... Each handset defaults to private phone book use, so to switch to the shared phone book involves a couple of button-pushes, each of which takes ages to respond. And don't try getting ahead of it: your button pushes may or may not be recognized."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Works Great!,"Works great on laptop, camera and in desktop reader.  Careful that you do not change the file format or else it will not work in your camera.  I made this mistake and was not able to use it.  Since I have fixed that it has worked great!  Good speed!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent tool for ipod video,"just want to recommend to everyone this cable since you can watch movies trough your Ipod video without any problem, excellent video quality considering that you pay no more than $11 buck"
electronics,,5.0,Great accessory!,A God send for me!  Thank goodness I bought this before I almost got lost in the ocean in the fog. (Without AA batteries!!)
electronics,,5.0,Perfect for my needs,"I got this for my baby's room.  I was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews, but it's quite good (though I don't have the ear of an audiophile).  The bass is pretty powerful & the treble is good as well.  There is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well."

electronics,4 of 4,4.0,EPSD/128 SD Card ,ACP-EP Memory Mobile Storage 128MB Secure Digital SD Card works well in my Tungston E handheld. I use RealPlayer to transfer and play my mp3s and the 128 size is just right for a days worth of tunes. Very easy to use
electronics,,5.0,I like this iPod so much...,This iPod was great while I could use it.  Then my wife took it and now I only see it when she needs me to recharge it!!  I guess it is safe to say that she likes it too!!
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good headphones,"You can't beat the price.  Bose is $400, Sony $300.  They work great on airplane movies.  Airplane radio had a slight hiss.  They are lightweight and travel well.  They block out most sound.  Bose, which I've used, are a bit better, but not 5 times better."
electronics,10 of 12,2.0,Unsatisfied,"I am dissappointed with this DVD player. As I do not own it, my mom's work has this exact unit, and the people at work are very unhappy with it. "
electronics,40 of 47,4.0,If you don't have digital audio avoid this product,"If you don't have digital audio capabilities avoid this product.  Instead, purchase the ""Monster Cable PGL400 CVAA-10 GameLink"" instead [Product Number: B00006345I].  It is the exact same item (with the highest quality ""Component Video"") except that it has 5 cables instead of 3 (including 2 analog audio cables which will work with all TVs)."
electronics,,4.0,Just What I Needed...4.5 Stars,I bought this to condense my CD collection and I love it.  I am methodical about the storage and organization of my CDs and this was the perfect thing.  It is durable and has survived my dog (a yellow lab) which is saying a lot.  The only reason that I did not rate it 5 stars is that I have to remove all the pages when inserting a new page to keep the CDs alphabetize.  I was aware of this from other comments so it is not that big a deal.  A good buy for what I need.
electronics,,1.0,Bad quality of sound,"Probably due to local circumstances (I used this product in Moscow, Russia) the quality of sound was so poor (as noisy as a far-away radio wave) that I stoped using this transmitter"
electronics,7 of 12,5.0,I love this mp3 player!,This was my first Mp3 player I have ever boughten and I have not regretted buying it.  I should have gotten screen protectors for since the screen is a tad scratched up now but that was my fault so it's okay.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great little reader,"I'm a Mac user (OS 10.4) so I particularly like that this reader doesn't require a separate driver. Cards mount on my desktop as any drive would, and the software that came with my Canon Powershot G6 senses the card automatically. "
electronics,,4.0,Good Value,"I love this MP3 Player. I recently bought a red iRiver H10 20GB MP3 Player/Recorder because the RCA Lyra that I had stopped working on me. I bought this one refurbished because it was cheaper, but I don't have any major problems with it. It holds a lot of songs and I love the radio and recorder feautures. The only big problem is you CAN'T skip to the next song. You either have to keep fast forwarding, or go back a screen and actually click on the next song. This is especially annoying if you have it on shuffle mode and want to quickly get through your songs. A minor problem is the size. I know this isn't the newest model, and it is pretty bulky. It isn't really pocket size, so I'm constantly using the belt clip. If you have a lot of songs and only need a couple of basic functions, this iRiver H10 is perfect for you"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great product for the money,"I have printed on many types of paper and this product works great with my Canon S9000 printer.  After trying many types of paper I have settled on Canon, Epson or Agfa depending on what I am printing.  This product is great for snapshots and is a lot easier than what I use to do (cut 8 1/2 x 11 paper down).  My previous method was chosen because I could never find good quality paper for snapshots.  The color is good and even throughout the print.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs to print snapshots, very affordable.."

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,GREAT PHONE!,Phone works great.  Quality product and not some cheap Vtech like phone. 
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great Performance,"Works great,good coverage. Had a small problem setting it due to changeing my ISP from cable to DSL. Called tech support, and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent mp3 player!!,"I have test it for a while now, it plays really great, the usb function is awesome, the SD card is really great, i think this unit is an amazing one, so you if you like it, buy it, you won't loose any cents"
electronics,,5.0,A very good value,Same cord offered at local store was $29.99.  Got it here for less than 10% of that. 
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Love, love, love my Roady!","My husband gave me this Roady for a Christmas present last year, and I have enjoyed it so much that I'm buying one for my mother-in-law for Christmas this year!"
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,great for the money ,I wanted to step up to HD DVD since I love dvd movies.  
electronics,7 of 12,5.0,Voice recorder - top of the line!,"The Sony ICD-MX20VTP Digital Voice Recorder has been great.  It's easy to set up the computer, and transfer my work notes to print.  Great investment!!"
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Works like it should...,"Has a nice smooth feel to it, good solid connectors that won't break quickly. Belkin makes great cables"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Forget all those cables,"I bought this card reader to use with my SD memory cards from my digital camera and Palm Tungsten E2. Transferring pictures and music via the cables supplied with the camera and Palm is a bit slow and who needs more cables?  This little device allows me to add, delete, copy and paste files using My Computer.  It takes up virtually no room, and I use it between both my desktop and laptop computers.  There was no installation issues - I have Windows XP on both machines and it recognized and installed the card reader immediately, without any interference from me. Last but not least, the price can't be beat"
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,Great device,"I have used the TomTom 700 on a bunch of occasions, and have always found it to be a great device.  When I describe the product to friends of mine that aren't familiar, I usually tell them about the time when I used it to find a B&B way outside of town in the boonies. I had forgotten a map, as I found out later, but the 700 helped us find our way it the middle of nowhere - which was really surprising and great.  I don't know what we would have done if we didn't have it - I might have actually had to stop and ask for directions - but then again, who knows if that would have gotten us further lost.  I won't go on long road trips without one. They are a lifesaver (especially when you need to re-route in a pinch), and are so easy to use."
electronics,9 of 10,4.0,WHAT FUN!!    I LOVE IT!,"I had a crank radio since 1999, and it finally gave out this year.  I was excited to find this one at a decent price, and with the added bonus of a cell phone emergency charger! The adapters fit most phones, and it's just good to know that wherever you are, you can make a phone call even with a dead phone battery. I read some reviews about a difficulty getting the battery case open, but I had absolutely no problem with it.  Yes, it would be great if it came with an AC adapter (and I wouldn't have it without);  I just rigged up my own with a Wal Mart universal power supply for $15.00. It takes 4.5 -5 volts. It runs for HOURS after charging it with an adapter. Reception has been good, not only in northern Wisconsin, but in Illinois as well. NPR is great! and who really needs the TV stations! (though I do get one once in a while).Anyway, I recommend it"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Safety Net!,"I love that I don't have to worry about backing up my data anymore.  This system works very well.  There was a little bit of a learning curve for me, although I eventually figured it out.  Any file over 4GB (video programs, etc) won't transfer so you have to change your settings.  But once I figured that out, it has been great"
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,"Horrible, tinny sound","Being a bit picky, I don't normally get something like this without being able to try it first, but I decided for the price, and based on the generally positive reviews here, I'd give them a try.  I didn't expect to have any problems with them other than fit."
electronics,,4.0,Apple 20 GB Ipod,i am very happy with this Ipod works graet i got it used and it came with all the things a new one would and works good i give this Ipod an A
electronics,,2.0,A bit disappointed !!!,"Sound quality is good compared to other flash based mp3 players. Difficult to manage songs. Whatever you put to it, you have to encrypt by the ""Gigabeat Room"" software provided. I thought it would work like flash drive, just copy from hard drive and run mp3 songs but unfortunately it does not work that way. Every songs is encrypted with .SAT extension so you cannot share your mp3 songs with your friends. Pictures are also encrypted and make double file with *.GBP extension and every file is renamed when encrypted. It took me a lot of time to figure out how to operate this player first time when I received it. I suggest not to buy it if you can spend a few bucks more for iPOD or Creative. Although Toshiba is making improvements in their new line of mp3 players that has video capabilities."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A great deal,It is better than my old Panasonic and I am satisfied with the product in all features and promisses from Uniden
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"Quick, simple installation and works perfectly",I purchased the SlingLink to use with the Slingbox and have not been disappointed with either.  Installation requires no software (unless passwords are desired) and is as simple - and quick - as plugging in two Ethernet cables and plugging the devices into a wall outlet.  The installation guide recommends that both devices be plugged directly into an electrical outlet - do not use UPS or extension cords - so that could take some pre-planning as free outlets are at a premium for some of us!  I installed as recommended and the Slingbox has excellent video on my wireless laptop running Windows XP
electronics,3 of 4,2.0,It Broke!!,"I have had this mouse for almost a year now, and a couple of months ago it started flaking out, not always clicking when I clicked.  Then I had to start unplugging and re-plugging it to get it to turn on.  Eventually it just stopped turning on all together.  We tested other USB devices on my laptop, and found that it was indeed a mouse problem.  We even tried the mouse on several different computers.  I'm working on contacting Kensington to replace it, but so far I've only recieved an e-mail parroting back to me my original complaint"
electronics,4 of 6,2.0,disappointing,"This mp3 player was great when I first got it. However, I've not had it even a week yet, and it has begun freezing up and having other various problems. I would not suggest this item"
electronics,,4.0,Gets the job done,Decent backpack for under $25. Carries my laptop and all my books and notebooks
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Almost perfect product and great price!,"This product does what is advertised just fine: it crimps wires. I didn't want to sped a lot of money because this is just for my own house where I needed to crimp a few cables. For this, it worked well. The cables work, and I haven't noticed any performance issues with the resulting plugs. It also has little wire strippers and the like so you don't really need any other tools to get the job done. However, the outer insulator stripper that is built into the crimper seems to cut the wires too short, whenever I used the preset length the wires did not extend all of the way into the plug. Luckily, the product never really claimed to strip the outer insulator, so for the overall value of the product it isn't too much of an issue."
electronics,,4.0,Excellent Phone-CAUTION Be Very Careful in Power Surges,The speaker phone is incredible very happy there.
electronics,14 of 18,1.0,Good Ratings Suprise Me...3 Uses Then Failure,"After buying the 128MB Cruzer Mini for use with a new PC that has USB2 ports, I used the Cruzer perhaps 3-4 times for moving files to and from my computer at work.  Recently, I plugged it into my new PC and found it was reported as unreadable.  Moving to two other Windows XP PCs, the same was true.  This was enough to convince me the Cruzer was bad, so I exchanged it for another where I bought it at Best Buy.  The new unit immediately was reported as unreadable.  Given the good reviews here, I can only believe there must be some peculiar Windows XP problem with this particular USB key, or perhaps a combination of factors...USB 2.0, WinXP with SP1 installed, etc.  Efforts to get the Cruzer to work have failed but have identified what seem permanent enumeration entries in the Windows registry.  I've removed all USB devices including all host controllers, etc. in Device Manager, rebooted to safe mode, and tried again to delete the Sandisk registry entries with still no success.  There are no hidden devices I've overlooked...it just simply appears that use of the Cruzer has created these fixed registry entries; I'm inclined to think they may be the source of the problem, but why does the Cruzer fail on 3 totally unique PCs, albeit all with WinXP/SP1?  I've seen similar comments regarding Lexar USB keys; maybe they share a common memory or harware design with the Sandisk?  All I can say is stay away from them if you don't want to be left with useless junk after a short time.  While I recommend Amazon for their great prices and service, if you should buy the Cruzer Mini, I suggest doing so where you can conveniently and quickly exchange it, should yours also fail"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,easy setup .. but...,"This was a breeze to set up.  Just install the software on you computer, enter the model numbers of your components.  For those few items that aren't in the list, the 880 can learn from an old remote.  As a very nice bonus, if you don't have the old remote, the software will try to pick a device (example : you have an RCA tv Model XYZ , if model XYZ isn't in the list, it might suggest ZxY)  , and that suggestion should work. "
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Easy to use with great results,Most of the reviewers have it right about Epson's PictureMate system.  What a dream to set up and use.  Simply fantastic prints with vibrant color and incredible detail.  If you want to print great 4 x 6 images very economically look no further.  Your existing images will really come to life for you.  I thought I needed a new camera.  I was wrong

electronics,2 of 6,2.0,Great but Hard to get use to,"The Z-Board is great. But If you are playing Battlefield 2 and then switch to the ZBoard you are in a fix. The controls are totally different and very hard to get use to. If you start with it, it might be alright but I think the regular keyboard will be just fine"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Great Card at a Bargain Price,"[...] I have two of these memory cards now, and I just love their performance.  I use the cards for my Panasonic digital camera, and I have filled one card with over 700 pictures with absolutely no problems whatsoever.  I haven't experienced any of the speed problems that other reviewers say they have, and the claim that the card is made by Toshiba is completely factless and ridiculous.  There is no better value for the money on the market right now, and reading and writing on this card for me has been very fast"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Lowrance 500c,"This unit is right at the top for GPS , the only thing that I had to do was send it back for the People at Lowrance to update to the 1.7 ver,and everything is excellent now.Taken alot of small trips with it and the unit is better than I thought it would be for detail"
electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Belkin cable line horror,"I recently brought a hp printer all in one. The printer came as fast as I purchased it, it came 3 days after. But on the same day I ordered a Belkin Cable line and that did not come at all and I've been waiting over two weeks now. I can't use my printer unless I have the cable. This is the most horrible thing a person can do.. give you something but don't have the source to you use it. Wonderful.... I had to call them inorder to get another delivery of a cable line cause the line that supposely be sent to me was in transit in New Jersey. Still haven't heard from the first cable and now I'm still waiting on the second. They shouldn't even charge me for the shipping or the cable line make me wait for so long.."

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,The best combo of Fax and printer,"I bought it for my father as fax machine, printer, scanner and coppier."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Don't buy it from this company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this product from Amazon, as I trust Amazon. The product comes from ANTOnline, however, and this is not a company I will ever deal with again. It took me awhile to figure it out but the product was defective because one of the screws that hold the product on the printer was defective. The screw cannot be removed either. So I contacted Amazon and they refer me to ANTOnline. Their  defective product policy is that you go to the manufacturer for replacement. Period! I contacted Canon and after 25 minutes off and on hold the bottom line is they don't replace printer accessories so they say go back to the merchant for replacement. By this time ANTOnline support is gone on vacation. So I'm stuck in a catch 22 and I need this battery for a trip overseas. The thing that makes me angriest is that all this takes about 2-3 hours of my time and I don't like waisting time on something this stupid. I advise you to purchase this from a more reputable company. It's not worth the frustration"
electronics,,2.0,Very Disappointed with Lenmar,"Everything about this purchase was disappointing. The reason my wife and I got this battery initially was to keep our little ones happy and quiet on a long flight to visit the grandparents. It took much longer than we expected for us to receive this battery in the mail. When it finally showed up only two days before our flight, my wife opened the box and noticed that the battery was slightly scratched and somewhat used looking. After I fully charged this battery pack I plugged it into my portable DVD player and only got about 3 hours and 15 minutes of additional run time out of this battery. This is unbelievable to me considering the fact that Lenmar clearly advertises on the front of thier retail packaging in big bold yellow letters ""Up to 11 Hours Playtime"". When I called Lenmar tech support to try and find a solution the Tech support guy who took my call sounded like a nice guy and he politely informed me that this was normal that I got only 3 hours and 15 minutes of run time per charge and that unfortunately most portable DVD players on the market are not able to get even near the ""Up to 11 hours of Playtime"" that Lenmar claims. He also proceeded to inform me that there is also some very small print on the reverse side of the Lenmar retail packaging that says ""Run time depends on power demand"". I have a 9V portable DVD player with a 7 inch screen. My gosh, how much additional power demand could that possibly require? What a joke. Why waste everyone's time and money trying to promote a product on a promise that you can't deliver? Another disappointment about this battery was that it was not compatible with my second portable DVD player only because none of the connector tips fit which actually is not that much of a surprise being that this battery only includes a total of 4 connector tips. Also, I'm not very surprised that it looked somewhat used because I'm sure that Lenmar probably gets quite a few returns on this battery. Anyways, our final resolution ended up being returning this battery for a full refund and then ordering a batterygeek ultra high capacity external DVD battery which showed up the very next day and now gives our little ones a solid 12 hours of additional movie time per charge"

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Very nice CF wireless card,"This is a great card.  I use it with my iPaq 3950 and it provides excellent connection quality, on par with laptop PCMCIA cards.  Also it does not drain my battery and seems to use almost no power when I am getting a strong signal (close to the access point).  "
electronics,,5.0,Great quality light notebook case,"Don't let the price fool you, this is a quality notebook case.  I've traditionally used a larger leather briefcase, but I wanted a lighter case to use on occassion.  I've been so pleased it has replaced my heavier case.  My wife borrowed the case for one of her trips and I never got it back; I had to go out and buy a new one."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Love it,"I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous.  I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so!  I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move.  Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though.  Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Awesome, worth the money","Just wanted to sing my praises on the phones after using them for about 4 months.  I consider myself an audiophile (at least one that's on a budget), and found these higher-end earbud phones to be well-worth the money.  I did alot of research before deciding on these, and found the ratings on these to be most consistent.  I was wavering between these and the Shure's, but wasn't all too impressed with the bass on the comparably priced e3c Shure's."
electronics,6 of 14,5.0,VER GOOD,"I have owned this, and it works really well.  Its nice to be able to watch videos and listen to music on the same player.  Well worth it, but not for 99,999.99 :D.  "
electronics,28 of 28,5.0,Panasonic KX-TG5566M 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange,"I bought this to replace an Siemens handset that had performed great, but interfered my WiFI network. At 5.8 Ghz it operates at a different frequency and will not interfere with 802.11x networks. "
electronics,,5.0,"Works well under XP and Linux, decent ergonomics",I've had this mouse over a year now and use it with a Dell Inspiron 6000 under both Windows XP and under Linux (FC4).  I found that the mouse works quite well with the default drivers under both operating systems.
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"So, this is how a good one works!",I won a set of these at the International Flight Sim Convention in Denver this summer. They beat my CH USB Pro pedals hands down. These don't over draw the power on my USB hub like the CH did. I highly recommend them
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,"Works great as a PDA, reasonable price, no problems!","The E2 replaced my Palm M105 after 4 years of trouble-free service. I have had this device for about a year and never had a problem. I have not even had to recalibrate it yet! It charges in the sync cradle and has never once had the batteries discharge. I tried using it for music, but it does not do this very well compared to an iPod or MP3 player (sound is fine though). The main drawback is the file conversion and loading process is not simple. It is also too big to be a useful MP3 player in my opinion. I didn't buy it (or my cell phone) to be a music player, so no big deal for me! :-)"
electronics,,5.0,Good Solid Speakers,"I bought the Altec two piece about six months ago and I was thoroughly impressed with the sound. The bass isn't over-emphasized so there isn't any drowning out of the higher range sounds. Static is non-existant(unless the tone is turned up fully) even when the volume is maxed out. Like all speakers, I suggest you break them in. Give them 20 hours of play at a moderate volume level(breaking speakers and subwoofers in properly extends their lifespan and allows them to produce a consistent quality sound). Another great feature which is lacking on many other computer speakers is the headphone jack which is placed right in front of the speaker next to the volume and tone knobs. The length of the power cord and speaker wire are quite adequate. I have plenty of slack left if I want to move my monitor further away from the tower. Good solid speakers all around. You get the bang for your buck."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Great TV,We bought this product under some semi-expert's recommendation and it turned out he's right.  We were told that Sharp has devoted much R&D in the development of LCD TVs and by far is among the best and that this model is more advanced than other Sharp 37 Inch models (in terms of resolution & etc.)  Sony has good LCD TVs but is generally more expensive.  If you were ever in the store comparing different LCDs and there picture quality you wouldn't even be considering certain other brands.
electronics,30 of 33,5.0,This is awesome!!!,"With this and the proper device (recorder, drive, etc)you can record in high quality (Xp = 1 hour), Standard Quality (Sp = 2 hours), Medium (Lp = 4 hours) and low quality (EP = 6 hours)."
electronics,,4.0,Great mouse!,I really like this mouse. It connected to my built-in bluetooth quite easily and it does not lose the connection. The batteries last a long time. You can attach the USB charging cable and still use the mouse with the bluetooth connection. Great!! It is the perfect travel size. Good buy

electronics,,4.0,Koss Porta Pro Headphones,"These headphones have significantly better bass response than most lightweight over-the-ear units. This is achieved partly by the fact that the headphones press quite firmly against the head-- possibly more than some people would like. There is a three-position selector on each side that allows you to adjust the pressure from ""Firm"" to ""Light""; but it resets itself to ""Firm"" immediately if you release the pressure on the earpieces. You almost need to make the pressure adjustment with the headphones on. A related issue; the headband is made of a very ""springy"" material that wants to collapse to the smallest position, making it necessary to readjust the headband for proper fit each and every time you put it on. Other than that, a very good value"

In this day and age no one seems to care about the consumer and I really appreciat how my problem was handle
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Good product.,"Fits my new Video iPod nicely.  Fits securely on my arm with adjustable spandex.  Wouldn't be a bad feature to have a slot at the bottom of it for the USB to plug in without having to remove the iPod (although it is very easy to remove).  If so, I'd just keep the iSnug on my iPod all the time (except occasional washings).  Somebody said it looks cheap.  I don't know...I think it looks good enough...and I'm not entering any swimsuit competitions with it, so I don't really care.  It's a good product for a good price, and it gets the job done.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no need to look for anything else...unless you just don't find it works for you (i.e. uncomfortable or loose).  However, I find it comfortable and secure...no worries.  I'm a male with average arms, but it seems to have plenty of room to tighten or loosen based on arm size and positioning"
electronics,7 of 10,4.0,pleasing performance,"Puts you in a pleasent place while listening. Won't cover up screaming babies or barking dogs and car horns,but the white noise that is ever present is covered sufficiently to make the experience much better than conventional phones. Highly recomended at the price compared to Bose which are no better"
electronics,,4.0,Silicon sleeve,This armband was certainly the right price.  I use it everytime I work out at the health club.  I never have to remove it to charge the nano.  My only negative comment is that dust sticks to the screen cover and cannot be cleaned off due to the compsition of the screen cover material. 
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Works with Dragon,"I find this voice recorder very easy to use from a performance perspective.  Buttons are easy to use for those with limited hand dexterity.  Storage space is more than adequate, and the price is right.  Transcribing from recording to Dragon NaturallySpeaking works very well, but do not expect perfection.  The only disappointment is the length of battery life.  I am presently researching rechargeable batteries for this item"

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Zen Micro-Great Value and Performance,"I have had my Zen Micro Photo for about 2 months now.  It is a great device.  Very easy to navigate and personalize to your likings.  The photo quality is very good.  The FM radio needs to be an open area, but still works great.  The microphone feature works VERY WELL.  You can record anything.  I am very happy I chose to purchase the Zen Micro.  You cannot beat the value of this item.  Just as good as an iPod"
electronics,,4.0,"Once It's Up and Running, It's Fine","After I received this item, I followed the instructions in setting it up and was not able to get it working.  I spent a HUGE amount of time on the phone with manufacturer tech support before it was up and running.  Not a single problem since then but getting it going was a pain"
electronics,,5.0,calling home... good phone!,"What you have here is a quality, reliable phone.  While it's not like the updated models you see today, it serves its purpose, and serves its purpose quite well.  When it comes down to it, no matter what kind of fancy phone you see in the world today, you're still basically typing numbers in *just* to talk to someone.  This is why ANY phone will do.  The size, comfort and everything else doesn't matter when it comes down to it.  Don't even get me started on ""ring tones"".  Geez.  "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,You don't need batteries!!!!!!!!,"Finally, I found a pair of speakers that have an AC adapter instead of batteries and it has volume control. I heard it has no bass, but I don't care. As long as they work good, I am happy. I purchased a $40 pair of speakers and they run on 2 aaa batteries. It has no volume control and 2 batteries last only 4 hours!!! I am returning the ones I purchased and buying these. These are very compact too. They can fit perfectly on my computer desk next to my iPod. Sony has been the maker of quality and more..."

electronics,6 of 6,1.0,Massive frustation. ,"This unit was a complete waste of my money. I set it up, it worked fine for 1 day. We watched 2 dvds on it total. After that, the player made a harsh grinding noise and quit. It is now FUBAR. It powers up, but will not load or play any discs."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Don't buy,"I bought this product and really enjoyed it for a month. Then it stopped working. The reason why?  The battery in the remote died. And there's no way to turn on the unit without the remote.  This is an inexcusable design flaw.  Worse still, changing the battery in the remote is not simple. And the manual (as well as the on-line PDF manual) say nothing about changing the batter.  I paid almost $100.00 for this piece of junk.  Stay away"
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,great long distance connection,"this product offers a great connection to your home audio system if you have the upgraded sound blaster live output panel with the digital output.

electronics,3 of 6,4.0,OOOOH....Almost there,"I have to say I was very pleased with the ease of interfacing and manuevering. Have to say I did have a DOA, but Amazon was very fast and courteous about advance replacement and making me happy so I really have no complaints there. I have found that the output level isn't all that great when you connect up to an FM transmitter for your car, but as for headphone volume it kicks butt. "
electronics,16 of 16,5.0,&quot;Bang for the buck&quot; CF Card,"I bought this CF Card for my Canon Digital Camera and it reads and writes really, really fast compared to the stock canon CF and to my old 256MB SanDisk CF.  For its performance, its definitely worth the price.  If your looking for a really good CF card, this is the one for you"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Very Useful,Kensington's Cable Winder is very handy for cutting down the clutter - overpriced but useful nevertheless
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Simple yet effective,This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.
electronics,,5.0,Fully Satisfied,"The device works perfectly.  The picture quality is excellent, the documentation is adequate, and the overall robustness of the machine seems good.  Loading is slower than my old DVD player - a Toshiba.  I really like the way I can watch one DVD part way through, replace it with another, and have the player still remember my place in the other one.  I also appreciate the HDMI interface but have not upgraded my television to take advantage of it yet.  In the end, I was willing to spend a few extra bucks for a quality player and based on performance so far, that's what I got"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,8910 Universal Remote Really Is Universal,"I am amazed at how well this remote works and how it can control all my components.  My TV (a Vizio 42 inch plasma) and DVD player (KLH) were not in the included database, so I called the support line and they were able to load the proper codes over the phone.  There are a few functions from my receiver that don't transfer, but the major ones do.  Two nice features on this remote are the Learning Keys and Macro Functions. I was able to program my TV functions that had special keys on the TV remote. For example: Aspect Ratio (wide, normal, zoom), PIP, and Input Selector (AV1,2, 3, Component, TV, DTV, etc..)I was also able to program my receiver-amp functions for DTV/CBL and for DVD (Digital Dolby).  With the Macro keys, I was able to program a 'one touch' function to turn on the TV, set the input, turn on the receiver and turn on the DVD player.  Because I had to program some special keys, I created a 'cheat sheet' that shows family members how to watch digital TV, cable TV, DVD, X-Box, VCR (still easier than having all the remotes lined up: Receiver-amp, Cable Box, TV, DVD1, DVD2, VCR).

electronics,16 of 17,5.0,This thing is amazing. ,I'm a cow and like most cows I use Photoshop heavily. All I can say is that I can not believe that I went as long as I did without this tool. Other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes. 
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A very good solution,"While it's not the same as a case, it is a very good solution to give your Palm that little extra protection it needs, when you're actually using it. "
electronics,6 of 9,5.0,BEST CABLE TO CONNECT YOUR DVD PLAYER !,"I purchased a Sony WEGA 27 inch tv. I took advantage of it's rear component input labeled video4.  I connected my Sony DVP360 Dvd player.  With dvd viewing, the movie Dinosaur, Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2, and Vegas Vacation, the colors were very vibrant, details were dynamic, and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution. I have viewed these same movies on larger screen HDTV's such as the Pioneer Elite and was disappointed??? Glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture. I can't imagine that I can do any better for my television than these cables.  I am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my Sony WEGA with these Monster component 3 cables"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Sound Great But Only in 2-3 Minute Intervals ,"These sound great, the in-cord volume control is nice but these buds don't go *in* the ear and subsequently fall out every 2-3 minutes. And because they don't go in the ear, they don't block out outside noise. I had to max out the volume on my Zen Vision:M at a coffee shop just to hear my music, figured I was destroying my ear drums. I will try the Sony 51's next"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Excellent phone but missing some functions,"Over all this phone works well with my Vonage. The sounds quality is excellent, and I like the ring tones."
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,I've Seen the Light,"Love these lights! I got the Griffin iBeam Flashlight and Laser Pointer for iPod recently and have been completely de-lighted . . . er, en-lightened! As the description says, the small efficiently designed little ""sub-pods"" pop right onto the top, offering either a medium bright flashlight or a red laser pointer. As a university teacher, I am frequently involved in presentation situations where I am in the back of a darkened room commenting on Powerpoint or other computer images. Since I often use my iPod in the class as well, the flashlight is a perfect momentary plug-in to check notes. The laser is useful and works well, allowing me to focus attention on areas of a painting, image, map, or text with ease."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works great and is a better buy than other products,"I bought another competing product, the 3Com pocket router,  because I heard a favorable review of it on the radio.  That product is about the size of a pack of cards, and includes a short ethernet cable to connect it as needed, and a power pack.  A carrying case is included to take things on the road.  The directions were not very clear.  If you aren't a techie (that's me), there were many gaps in the directions for installation.  One example was when I had to label a network as ""ad hoc"" or ""infrastructure,"" and I had no idea what the heck either was.   The process became so frustrating, that I looked at the installation manual of this product: the D-Link Pocket Router.  I downloaded its installation manual and looked it over.  All the geek terms that 3Com took for granted were shown and explained in the D-Link manual.  I then set the 3Com settings using the D-Link provided information.  It worked fine. But, of course, by then I was interested in the D-Link Pocket Router and ordered it.  I am much happier with this product for several reasons:  First, as noted there is a detailed manual with full color pictures explaining things every step of the way; second, it is much smaller than the 3Com product, about 1/2 its size; third, and very important, the D-Link pocket router can be powered with its own power source, or you can hook it up using an included usb cable to your computer.  So you don't have to have the external power source to hook it up; 4th, [...], it was less than half the cost of the 3Com.  Bottom line?  I kept the D-Link and returned the 3Com.  It performs very well, is lighter, cheaper, and more versatile"

electronics,,2.0,Unreliable and disappointing,"This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives ""HDD Error"" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer ""sees"" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Buy,"Great speakers.  I've read that the bass speaker is too boomy, but that hasn't been the case for me.  I mainly use them for listening to music on my computer, so I adjusted the bass using the equalizer on windows media player, and they sound terrific. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Logitech G7,"Mouse has a comfortable feel. Design functions are very good. The battery does not hold a very long charge, there is a spare battery but, it takes at least 12~24 hours to be fully charged and is charged thru USB port.

electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Don't Buy this tv!,"I ordered this tv a few weeks ago. When it came, the tuner didn't work and it would not tune in to tv stations at all. Amazon was real good about replacing it for another. When that one came, I took it out of the box and there was a completely different problem with that one! I could hear it just fine as it tuned in to different stations, but there was no picture at all! This one is going back too! What a waste of time and I am still without a tv in the room I was going to use this in because these small tvs are hard to find nowadays"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,24 months of daily use and these continue to please,I got the Sony MDR-DS3000 Infrared Wireless Digital Surround Headphones and an additional Sony headset for myself as a Father's Day gift in 2004 (from Crutchfield- Amanzon did not carry at that time). This is a long time ago for consumer electronics.
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Good positive keystrokes,I use this keyboard at home and a conventional one at work. At first I found the conventional one tight after using this one for a bit. The key angle is good. I like the lights down the middle also.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works as advertised. Great with my Rebel XT,"Hard to be verbose about a CF card...but it has performed without a hitch in my Rebel XT. Used a 1GB Ultra II when I bought the camera a year ago, picked up the 2GB card before a family vacation in August. Excellent product, no worries"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent price for great product,"If you googled your particular brand/number for ink cartridges, Amazon site was and has been the best price for new ink cartridge. These cartridges are new not the recycled junk. I look to Amazon for most all office and household needs. I love the free shipping as I usually spend more than 25 dollars"

electronics,4 of 6,5.0,Great Product,"This is a great product, I have a Tungsten T5 and I trimmed the protector using the guide on the back side.  IT FIT PERFECTLY !!  Great for protecting your investment!!"
electronics,23 of 26,1.0,Changing Combos,"I am a student living in a dorm situation and so wanted some basic protection for my lap top computer.  I purchased the defcon cl because it was inexpensive, widely availible, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, it has one major drawback, occasionally it decides to change the number combinationss which unlock it.  I went to the company website and they suggested trying the numbers immediately around the combination and if that failed trying all the number combinations possible (there are 10,000).  Several hours, one blister, and 1787 combinations later, I got frustrated and used a jewelers saw to cut through the connection to my computer (this solution took only five minutes).  I would not suggest this lock to anyone who lacks the patience to try trial and error experimentation until they reach the correct combination, nor anyone attending a school with a metalsmithing program"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Not great,"I would not recommend this unit. The reception is very poor. I am using it in an 06 car, so the electronics are up to date. I would say it picks up distortion free maybe 20 percent of the time. I had a XM Commander in my previous vehicle, it was great. I think I will get another for my current car"
electronics,,2.0,Very disappointed,I read a lot of reviews of cordless phones before I bought my Panasonic KX-TG5050.  Wow were they ever wrong.  
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Minimum Range, Excellent Sound ","The range on these things is terrible. I suggest putting the receiver up high with nothing blocking its path on any side to maximize the connection; this includes walls, cats, and furniture. That being said, the sound quality is absolutely great. It's like a surround system hooked directly to your brain. Some people complain about a hiss, but that only happens when you're going out of range"
electronics,15 of 16,4.0,It Is No Stereo But........!,"If a person has a non Ipod MP3 player i.e. Creative, Dell, or Iriver and does wants to hear music out in the open the choices are pretty limited. The sound of these portable speakers are more extended than the Creative Travelmate in the bass and treble but still are a bit on the thin side sonically but what can you expect for $70 to $80? Dell is asking $100 for this product which is too much. The specs say that the bass goes down to 60 hz which I find hard to believe. Probably 100 hz is more  realisitic. For listening to music while traveling or for casual listening in out of the way rooms of your home this is worth the money otherwise buy a real stereo. "
electronics,15 of 15,5.0,What you MUST know about this remote before making a Decision.,I read all the negative review and became VERY wary of purchasing. I decided due to the price and no clear runaway reason to go with another Universal remote to give this one a try. Boy am I glad I did that because it's GREAT once you get it programmed. There are 4 caveats!
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product,The Garmin StreetPilot 2610 is full of useful features and is easy to use.  The portability is great and the weighted dash mount works well in both our cars.  The spoken voice from the speaker is crisp and clear and the instrucctions are easy to follow.  I would receommend this poduct to anyone wanting a top-of-the-line In-Car GPS Receiver
electronics,4 of 8,1.0,Warning: World's Worst Alarm Clock,"Last Christmas my husband was tired of hearing my cell phone alarm go off every morning, so he bought this alarm clock as a gift.  He had read some Amazon reviews and promised me I would love this clock.  The night after Christmas, when I first tried to set the alarm for the next morning, I became so frustrated with the clock that I actually threw it at my husband.  The clock is nearly impossible to set.  After 30 mintues, I was able to program the alarm to go off every morning at 5:30...seven days per week.  It is so time consuming to change this awful clock that every morning since I first set it, I have been awakened at 5:30.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a rather pesky small button basically attached to the snooze bar, which often causes one to shut off the alarm mid-sleep.  This is never a good way to start your day.  If there are any husbands out there looking for a nice gift for your tired and overworked wife, avoid this horrible alarm clock at all costs!  Also, it sets itself to some sort of internal automatic ""world time,"" which at first seems like one of its best features.  However, I have found that ""world time"" has gained about ten minutes since December, which adds another wrinkle to one's morning routine.  Be advised...this clock is a disaster"
electronics,,5.0,What the HP 49 series should have been from the beginning (fantastic calculator),"I received my HP 50g as a warranty replacement for an HP 49g+.  Whilst I was extremely impressed with the number of functions the HP 49g+ offered, along with the computational speed, I was not impressed with the keyboard.  The keys were stiff, the backing hollow sounding, and the impression was that it wouldn't last.  Well, it didn't.  After a key breakage, it was sent back to Hewlett Packard and replaced with the HP 50g.  I should add here that the HP calculator customer support section was wonderful.  Once the problem was reported to HP, I was advised that the calculator would be replaced, I sent it to HP and received the replacement a few days later.  Great service!"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Efficiency nut,This is the best solution so far for storing DVDs.  I tried the DVB80 for a week and it was too cumbersome to handle and virtually impossible to organize.  The DVB40 is easy to access and still a huge space saver.

electronics,20 of 24,2.0,Buy the Cheap ones!,"Using the component input on your TV can make a huge difference in picture quality, but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable. Save yourself $50 and buy the cheap ones"
electronics,11 of 12,4.0,It Works,"I certainly wish it were smaller, but I guess that'd be hard to manage while retaining the feel of a normal keypad. The unit works well and adds some features that would probably be handy for spreadsheet work, like enter and backspace keys"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Can't do much better for the price,"I've had this unit for about a year and have been generally satisfied with the unit.  I use it as a TV and PC using a TV card.  The display is quite bright and the colors are vivid.  The only technical problem I've had has been with red static, which I think is my video card more than the TV.  However it's easily corrected by changing the color depth lower and then changing it back.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Olevia, despite not being a major brand"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,"New, just bought...and I LIKE IT!",Amazing speaker for a clock-radio system.  I'm impressed.  I will follow this review up with another if it fails to meet my criteria for a FANTASTIC dual-alarm clock radio CD player

electronics,13 of 15,2.0,Convenient but repairing one component is a pain,"I have had this model for 2 years now and the DVD player suddenly stopped working.  I have to send the whole thing to get it repaired.  It is just not worth it!!  When it worked, it wasn't bad.  Since the DVD and VCR are all inbuilt, I needed only one cable to hook this set up in our bedroom (no clutter!).  However, keep in mind that even if one of the component breaks, you have to send the whole thing back!"
electronics,,1.0,Terrible product for the car,"I haven't tried it on a stationary radio yet, but in the car this device works very poorly.  Even after switching the stations trying to find the setting that works best, the static comes in and goes out continually drowning out the music.  An aggravating little thing that makes you want to just toss it out the window"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Great Linux-powered router with USB storage,"As soon as I received my Linksys WRTSL54GS, I flashed it with the OpenWRT firmware... and my device works great. It's been running for 3 wks now since I've bought it, with no problems. I did not attempt to use Linksys' OEM firmware, which other reviewers have noted is not very good."
electronics,,4.0,IR Wireless Keyboard works like a charm!,"I had no problems. The only inconvenience is where the space bars are located in relation to the unit hinge. My right thumb keeps hitting the hinge. It is something you can train your thumb to avoid, I suppose. The Infrared works like a charm with my Tungsten E2"
electronics,,4.0,almost great,"I was looking for a radio with the kind of buttons you see on car radios, and for some inexplicable reason they are very hard to find.  But the guy at Radio Shack directed me to this one, and I really love it, except for two things:  (a) even though the clock is purportedly self-set by some super-sophisticated government satellite, it is ALWAYS nine minutes fast (I just don't get that!); and (2) sometimes you have to play with the wire antenna to improve the reception (but even that isn't a big deal).  All in all it's a pretty terrific little radio, if you can get used to having a clock that is always nine minutes fast!  (Or maybe yours won't be, and it's just me!)  So, on the whole, I'd recommend it"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product,This is another great Belkin product.  It was the perfect size for my needs and easy to plug in.  The picture quality is great and I am sure the right cabling is the reason.  Recommend this product to anyone

electronics,1 of 5,4.0,"Great tv, only 1 issue","I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but still, this is a great TV. The 24"" tvs in general are a good balance between screen size and price, without being totally unwieldy and huge."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,"Fairly good generic mount for my Treo 650, but not the most portable","I bought this unit to mount my Treo 650 while I am using my TomTom navigation system.  I like the fact that this set has both a windshield mount and a vent mount using the same sled.  My thought was that I could use the same set for both a permanent (windshield) mount in my car, and as a portable unit that I could take on the road.  "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,good for most of the time,this product is really good if you are doing something away from your computer. make sure you adjust the settings for almost every different task you do though. you'll have to decrease or increase the volume on the transmitter and make sure the red light is blinking maybe 50% of the time. then you can adjust the headphones volume settings. sometimes the reception becomes bad though... kinda weird cuz it happens rarely but i don't know what's causing it..
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Very nice unit,"This box is much better than the GE 29016S one I had previously. The return-call feature is nice, and this unit even has a stand underneath in case you need to view it at a higher angle."
electronics,13 of 16,1.0,"Unfortunately, the bad reviews are true","I risked buying one of these, because it was the maximum amount of TV I could fit into my 32"" cabinet.  But I should have listened to the warnings.  When I got the TV in the cabinet and turned it on, the screen was spotted by blobs of pink, green, and blue.  The picture tube was shot.  I have no choice now but to wait for Toshiba to bring another and hope it works better"

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Can not rate it if you can't hear it.,Bought this unit so I could have XM in my office. Live in a semi-rural area and public radio reception is hit and miss. Have Direct TV at home and they use XM for the music channels so decided to pay to have at work.
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,ED,the tape is really bad. it's noisy and one of the channels doesnt even work.
electronics,7 of 16,4.0,"Very sturdy, good looking, but pricey and HARD to install","I read one review that it was easy to install, not so.  Unless you do a lot of drilling in walls, and are familiar with the millions of pieces included, you'll be utterly confused.  The couple pages of instructions were grossly inadequate.  It comes provided with just about every screw / bolt you could ever possibly need (labeled in pouches A through O), but the instructions refer to pouches that aren't even there (e.g., package N), it's not too hard to figure out the correct package, but you'll still be somewhat confused and wondering."
electronics,18 of 18,5.0,Excellent corded/cordless phone,"I needed a phone that had at least three features:  Corded so that I had a phone during electrical failures, a digital answering machine, and a loud ring capability, as I am hard of hearing.  This phone has all these features, plus it's attractive, and there is an extra handset that I can use in another room.  The set up was easy....with a clearly written manual combined with voice prompts from the phone base.  The base handset is a very comfortable weight and has a very natural ""hand fit"".  Also, the sound quality is excellent.  I've only used the remote handset once, but it worked as well as the base handset.  I would recommend this phone for anyone, not just ""older"" folks who need the larger keypad or the louder ring"

They have pretty good sound, a nice carrying case, and have survived over a year's worth of running.  I have not had any problems with them falling out of my ears or the wire shorting out.  In fact, I use a tie on the wire so that the cord is not so long when I run.  Despite this, no problems."

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,One of the best products on the market,"These remotes are totally awesome.  The products are so good that the Harmony company was purchased by peripherals leader Logitech.  The software works great, web-based configuration is simply genius and support is top notch.  They make a whole line of remotes so you can pick the one that's perfect for you.  This is a great entry level model if you want to stop using multiple remotes with your home theater system.  Don't bother looking any further - the value here is unmatched"
electronics,,5.0,Great Product,"Used this phone system to replace telephones of every size and description that had been collected over many years and scattered throughout the house.

This is the worst attempt of HDTV I ever seen. It is like a no name brand that should be blank. I would not buy a Magnavox anything Digital Video display again. Everyday the set looks as if it ages 1 year and if it last longer, that would be the only good thing to say. The TV sounds as if lightning is going through the speakers and is as bad as the display which looks like lightning struck it. No way will you ever get a picture that looks like Magnavox 15MF605T 15"" LCD Flat Panel TV image on the web page"

I do not like having to have an adaptor for the cell and the GPS unit and wish it took a normal USB type.  Maps seems fine, voices are great.  I am not sure if the Delorme version would have been a better deal though and it would have been less"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Brilliant invention with drawbacks.....(?) ,"First, amazon had this nearly $20 cheaper than most competitors plus, I took advantage of the free shipping (though I sacrificed a week)but it all arrived freshly new. With a bose system on my new Pathfinder, the transpod worked flawlessly with my photo ipod. I plug it in the charger, set the stations and voila! Music! "

electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Pretty Sweet I Guess,This is a good mp3 player it comes with ear bud headphones which personaly i don't like but have good sound. One dropback is that you have to write all the artist info if you want it to appear on the player. On some songs the sound is alought better than others and i'm not sure why. I'm looking to buy a new one olny because this dosn't have much space 512 mb. You can perzonalize it by putting key chains or whatever on the hook on the top. it has some good extra settings and overal is good
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Griffin iSqueeze Cradle,"This item works great if you have a formed cupholder in your automobile. I would not reccomend it for individuals who have one of the ""pop up"" plastic cup holders. I have an iPod mini and it works great. This along with the iTrip is a great way to have your own radio station in your car"
electronics,,5.0,Good product,I am satisfied with this product. Much better than my 128 card. Lots of pics i use for ebay. Big Time Saver. Excellent. No worries here
electronics,8 of 11,5.0,Great for war and flight games!!!!,"The main reason I bought this was for Battle Field 2, but its great for flight sims as well.  Nice sticks and it comes with its own drivers for the L.E.D.'s.  Very nice for the price.  Easy to learn how to operate, took me less then 10 minutes on Battle Field 2.  Had to configure it in the options, but it was worth it.  Nice for Microsoft's Flight sim '04 and Lock On.  Gets five stars from me"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Suffers the Wear and Tear Instead of my Headphone Jack!!!,"This Monster Splitter is very well made and is visually appealing. It should last a lifetime. I bought this for my Cowon Iaudio U3 mp3 player. I connect this splitter to the U3 headphone jack and use the jacks on this instead of connecting my headphone directly into the U3 all the time, that way I save the wear and tear on my U3 headphone jack but this splitter could be used for any device that has a headphone jack not just for mp3s or Ipods."

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Motorola Radios,"These are my second batch to buy.  After about a year I began to have trouble but that was after some hard use.  For the price they are an excellent deal.  Great range, rugged and worth the money"
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,"iTunes, which is an integral part of iPods, is not stable and can be a nightmare",Corrupt iTunes Library nightmare--
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,The best,this protecter is the best. it does protect my ipod from scraches and dings like the box said. and the edges around the screen get thick and that protects the screen. I like it becouse it dosnt take away the ipods elegant look. it dosnt add bulk to the ipod. it has a little hole at the botton for the dock connector so you can connect it to speakers or other things with a dock connector while still having the case on. it takes time to put on and take off.I will post some pictuers very soon for all you buyers could see what it looks like since this product dosnt hav any. you can also buy this at Best Bu
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Confused the Lowrance I-way 500 with the Lowrance I-way350,When I purchased the Iway 500 I wrongly thought that it was the same as the I-way 350 only with a larger screen and more features because it was the more expensive item. The screen size was excellent and its overall performance was very good. However it was too heavy and inconvenient to hold and bring back and forth from car to car and home. The fact that it  didn't have a battery also was inconvenient. The screen was bright and clear on both models.  The auditory turn by turn directions with adjustable volume is also very good. Another excellent feature is the automatic recalculating of directions should you choose to vary from the initially calculated route.  In other words it accurately keeps up with you giving new directions from your most current position
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Must Have!,This is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot.  If I leave my laptop somewhere I hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad.  This is really small and compact! Perfect for traveling too.  I've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem...it still recoils well
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,NOT Nokia OEM,"I purchased this cable through Amazon from A-1 Accessories - the packaging is the same as shown in the picture and the driver disk is a CD that has been printed using an ink jet printer.  The instructions were printed 8-1/2x11 paper - don't lose them because if you do, you are hosed - you must follow the instructions to the letter - no jumping ahead 'cause you know what you are doing. "
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Works Well with Sharp Zaurus,"The size of this case is perfect, just slightly bigger than the Zaurus, and it provides good access to the keyboard and the CF/SD slots. With the belt strap, it is quite convenient to carry, and I can also fit my Targus CF Modem into the case. The Zaurus attaches within this case with velcro. So it is removable, and even with the velcro on the back of the Zaurus, it fits into its cradle just fine"
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Epson Premium Lustre Photo Paper,"This is a fantastic product.  I use it to print pictures with a professional look.  It is a matte finish paper and the finished product looks so much better on this paper than any other photo paper.  I print at home, and it is virtually impossible to distinguish the photos I have printed on this paper from professional processing.  I highly recommend this product"
electronics,22 of 23,2.0,"Mediocre sound quality, questionable reliability, weak radio reception",I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Drive not recognized,"Worked great to start with, and I wrote a bunch of large files to it from a Mac Powerbook. It then quit working when I tried to read them back, maybe the drive was not booting properly (only the red standby light on the front remained on), anyway the drive either was not recognized or otherwise did not mount."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,You never forget your first time,"This is my very first GPS and I'll never forget my first time with Jill. My wife and I used it for the first time to drive from San Antonio TX to Yellowstone Park, via a side trip to Boulder CO to see our daughter. And we'll never forget the joys of not being lost and the comfort of having ZERO fear of getting lost. The Nuvi is my friend. We love the voice of Jill. She never becomes exasperated if we don't do exactly as she offers, but if we DO follow her instructions the end result is always spot on.... except for exact street addresses of homes. I suspect that's more of a builder's problem as they assign inexact house addresses than it is a Nuvi problem. Still, home addresses are within a house or two."

electronics,,5.0,The Kensington Remote rocks!,"I have been presenting for years and have tried a number of remote control presentation and laser pointer devices.  I wish I had found the Kensington 33062 a LONG time ago.  This product is awesome!  The fact that the device is powered from the USB is key, there are no batteries to worry about changing.  The device is super light weight and fits very comfortably in your hand.  And the laser pointer actually works, it is a very bright, clear light.  I highly recommend this product. "

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Super,"When travelling, you want it small and light. Besides, you need it to be precise and comfortable. All these features come with this handy (or fingery!)mouse. You won't regret it"
electronics,7 of 10,5.0,Top Notch Cable,"This is a great video cable, though it's very spendy. Superior to composite & S Video. Monster classifies it as &quot;ultimate performance&quot;. I'd say only DVI & HDMI, which are both digital, are better. I needed a 2M or 6.5' cable because the 1M was just too short for my needs. I looked at this one (90$) and Monster's new THX Ulta 1000 4' component cable(100$). They had equal features. The THX cable is better looking than this one, however when it came down to it I didn't want to spend 10 extra bucks on a cable that's 2.5' shorter! Now this cable isn't THX certified, but it is certified by Imaging Science Foundation. I typically recommend Monster Cable, I feel they are the leader in A/V cables. This is a great fit for a progressive scan DVD player and/or HDTV. Get the most out of what you paid for! Rock On."

electronics,14 of 14,1.0,Speedy transfer rate but poor design,"I had this drive for 5 months till its demise on 13 Dec 2005. Within 2 days of receiving the drive the plastic (yes, plastic!) molding to hold the cap in place wore off, so the cap stays on very loosely , if at all. I stopped wearing the drive around my neck for that reason. For that matter, I stopped using the cap!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Batteries are batteries,"Yes there are subtle differences in battery life and what not. But the bottom line is all batteries will meet a minimum standard.  The real advantage in this is the volume or number of batteries. You never have them when you need them and there is an increasing need for them in everything from players, detectors, lights and transmitters. I find it is smarter to buy the 30 pack and replace all the batteries at once with a few left over for high use devices"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,EXCELLENT KEYBOARD !!!,I have three of these keyboards and LOVE Them !! I will NEVER ever go back to a regular keyboard or mouse .. Using this keyboard with a Trackball mouse has made my Carpel Tunnel go completely away !
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Great quality for relatively low price!,"The item I purchased is surprisingly low at price compared to other brands. Only I did not like the reseller that I was redirected to (XP Passport) they did not have any only support, their website is very poor and untill now I still did not receive any reply for my questions that I've asked them through their contacting email"

electronics,5 of 5,4.0,"Nice pen drive, but a couple of things I wish I'd known","I got this pen drive to replace a 512 MB drive that became corrupted.  Ths Kingston 1 GB drive is all that I need in terms of size, seems reliable, and has a nice security program built in.  It also seems to be well-built and the cap snaps on securely."
electronics,,5.0,Good DVDs,"These DVDs are a good choice.  Until now, no one has go wrong.  They are completely white to print anything.  Go buy them"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Worked the first time on my IPAQ 2215,I have an IPAQ 2215 and took the advice posted here to download the drivers and use them rather than what was on the CD. It worked the first time I plugged it in at my local coffee shop that provides free WiFi net access.
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Best product i ever bought (wish i'd gotten the 2gb though),"If you're considering buying a USB thumb drive, i recomend u take that extra step and get one that is U3 compatable. Given enough time and support, U3 drives will more than likely become the new standard in software portability. Imagine being able to carry with you all of your own programs, customized to your specifications, and being able to run them from any computer with a USB, regardless of your Administration settings. Bypass internet filters using the advanced settings in Firefox browser, chat to your entire catalogue of friends online via Trillian, call your family over broadband using Skype. Very easy to use and customize for the less tech savy, and very exploitable for the common hacker. While at work i can't install any new programs on a communal system, but with the U3 drive, i can have total control of my environment and privacy without effecting the next person to use the PC. Then unplug the drive when i'm done and take all that information with me, as though i was never even there."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,AUDIOPHILE SOUND AT LOW END PRICE,"If you are looking for great stereo sound from CD and the dolby digital 2.0 or LPCM stereo tracks on DVD, this is an excellent unit for anyone who does not want to invest in a home theater amplifier.  Just plug the stereo output cable into your stereo system, and you are ready to go.  Plays highly dynamic DVD flawlessly that distorted on some players costing much more.  "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Easy to install, works as billed",The bridge was simple to install and has worked well since we have has it installed.  It is controlling a HP Deskjet printer that is used in a classroom and gets a good amount of use.  It continues to work well and I would not hesitate to purchase another one if the need arose
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,I love this keyboard as a replacement for Apple Pro,"The only problem I have with this keyboard is that I had questions regarding it and sent two emails to Macally, through their customer service website, and never received an answer.  I guess they don't really care if they sell one or not and it makes me wonder if I should have problems down the road if they will give any response to a problem.  I was trying to choose between two different Macally keyboards.   "
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,WOW...Does everything I wanted a PDA for and more,"I wanted something to use geocaching.  This little jewel is perfect.  It works with cachemate software. It has got me paperless and so much more.  I use it for my grocery list, gift list, etc.  I use it to organize my daily schedule.  I find myself playing solitare while waiting for appointments.  I have used for 3 months now, I would be lost without it"
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,This particular order includes three managers,"Just as an fyi- this particular product: ""SUMAJIN Smartwraps Earphone Cord Manager"" is actually a set of three cord managers. This is a good thing, but I was a little confused because when I ordered, I saw three managers pictured. However, nowhere on the page does it say how many you get when you buy (Or, at least, I was unable to find that information)"

electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Great for the money!,This is a great mic for the money!  There is virtually no handling noise when using as hand-held.  The voice quality that it captures is up there with the more expensive equipment
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,A Good Line Doubler for the Price,"For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range"
electronics,71 of 71,1.0,"huge, cumbersome and awkward","This generic case for PDAs was awful.  It was way too big for the Tungsten E Palm and yet it fit in such a way that my card with 500mb was easily bumped so that it could be ejected and lost without my knowledge.  The stylus also hung out in such a way that I feared it's loss also.  Despite size, it had no pocket to hold a business card or stamp or spare dollar bill.  I also tried the metal one and found it impossible to open the tiny latch even without large or arthritic fingers."
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Uniden TRU8885 5.8GHz well worth whatever you pay ,"Absolutely one of the best in reception quality.  Great phone with tons of features and a cool and refreshing orange backglow CID on the handset and base.  Everything on this phones works wonderfully.  We have owned ours for over a year now and have no complaints.  The only limitation, as others have said, is that the CID and phonebook entries are not synched so you have to enter and delete them separately for the base and each handset, but small price to pay for great reception and a phone that works as good as this one.  One of these days the 'experts' that design and make phones will realize that when you delete or enter something on one part of an expandable phone it should be a universal change across all of them, till then this phone ROCKS"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,receptor reception,"neat, easy to use radio. It does not excell in pulling in distant staions"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good for working out,"I bought this mp3 earlier this year solely for working out.  I have no problems whatsoever.  The quality is great, downloading music is simple and fast and with the armband it makes it accessible especially when you're in the gym.  The unit itself is durable as I have dropped it a few times and bumped it into gym equipment quite frequently.  Like one reviewer stated, it is not shaped like the iPods and some may find it a bit bulky, however, if you are using it to accompany your exercising routines I highly recommend it."
electronics,7 of 30,5.0,"They're just mini DV tapes, buy em already!","Whattya wanna know?  They're tapes, they're priced well and they work in your mini-dv camcorder.  Stop reading all these posts and buy em already"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Sound,"I needed something for work to play my Ipod on, that also charged as it played.  The Kensington 33165 Speaker Dock does both very well.  It has good sound and is easy to use.  The only drawback is that it doesn't have a remote control device, but for me it doesn't matter, bacause I have it placed directly behind me so I can conveniently reach it.  You can't go wrong with this product"
electronics,,5.0,Magical unit,"I have had my XM2GO for over a year, use it every day in my car in a cradle attached to the a/c vents run through my car radio via the tape cassette, and carry it into my office every work day where it sits in a cradle on my desk and plays through a tiny AM-FM radio I bought for $10.  It works perfectly in both places and tolerates my moving it around without a squawk!  I also get 20 stock quotes scrolling around the bottom, so I don't have to punch in symbols. A truly wonderful product"
electronics,,1.0,Couldn't get it to work,Buy a Sound Blaster Audigy. This card wouldn't work after hours of trying. The SB card took two minutes to install.
electronics,,5.0,Alternate Uses for the Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter,"As the name implies, the Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter is intended to allow the user to connect video games to a wireless LAN.  I'm not sure how that works, since I don't own any video games.  Instead, I've used these adapters as both as point-to-point data radios and (after tweaking the settings a bit) to connect older computers to my home network."
electronics,,1.0,Not happy,"Hard to figure out and organize music... battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often... don't recommend it. Very ""Not happy"
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Excellent VCR/DVD Combo from Sony,"Sony SLVD370P DVD/VCR Progressive Scan Combo Player lives up its reputation as a leader in this market.  I am entirely satisfied with its performance, and it was easy to install. The VCR component is also bringing a sharper image to my antiquated TV set.  The only reservation is that the directions were slightly difficult; but after we got the ""hang of it,"" the equipment virtually installed itself.  Highly recommended product!!!"
electronics,12 of 13,5.0,Easy to integrate... but check compatibility.,"Bought this to add a 4th handset to my KX-TG5633. Initially, after reading the technical specs for the 5633 at the Panasonic website, I wasn't certain that the 560 would work with my system; the Pana website says ""Multi Handset Compatability: up to 3 handsets"". ""Did the 3 include the base handset too,"" I wondered? Yet the amazon info for the 5633 suggested that it could take 4 handsets. After digging out and consulting the 5633's manual, I was satisfied that I could take a 4th handset and ordered."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Best bag for a 17"" laptop!","I have searched MANY webites and stores for a bag big enough to carry a heavy 17"" screen laptop and all I can find are huge backpacks, huge messenger bags, or huge rolling casses - and all are very expensive.  I happened upon this one on Amazon, couldn't believe the price, and ordered it.  Not only is it big enough for my 17"" (which is rare), it also can hold a few books and other things without being too big or too expensive.  This backpack is sleek, attractive, and affordable.  Unless you need to carry tons of stuff (in which case maybe you need a rolling bag), you'll love this bag! "
electronics,,1.0,Unreliable Driver (XP),"Nice knob. Bad software. Usually does not start when OS boots. If it does, it won't last long. You have to CONSTANTLY reinstall the driver to make it work for a while. Yes, Griffin is a ""Mac"" company and yes, PCs suck and all - yada-yada...  None of the other USB devices I have fail like the Powermate does though.  Hey, Griffin, hire someone who knows how to make the damned thing work, OK? Tech support is NO help. This product has been out long enough for this problem to have been resolved. They obviously aren't concerned"

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Nice organizer for a low price,I paid about a dollar for this holder. Holds and protects the iPaq nicely. Can hold some credit cards as well as ID. Overall a decent product for a low price
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,Great for the price,"I had been looking for a surge protector/power line conditioner for some time. After upgrading some components, I suffered from some mid-frequency hum in the speakers that I know was related to my cable tv coax and many ac plugs into two weak powerstrips.  Well, I can tell you that this item solved my problems.  No hum, and the filters I really think make a difference in audio performance.  If I had an unlimited budget, I'd buy a high-end power conditioner, but for less than $200, this can't be beat.  If you have a decent stereo and/or home theater, you need to get one of these"
electronics,,5.0,Best things in life are simple!,"This headset lives up beyond what it promises, its an absolute dream to have owned these, despite its expense I bought two just to make sure that I always will be carrying one when I need one."

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Clix is  a hit!,"This little MP3 is the best one that I own.  I own 3 different ones (Creative vision m, sandisk 4gb and the Clix).  Out of all 3 it is the best by far.  I like the fact that it does pictures, videos, playlists etc..  It also has equalizers on it.  That's a nice touch.  The screen is really amazing and the pictures just don't show how great it really is.  I mean great.  It is a fingerprint magnet, so I put a cover on it.  The sound quality is fabulous!  Better than my other players and the funny thing is this one was the least expensive!!! I notice that my Sandisk and Creative have hissing sounds on certain songs.  I didn't notice it on the Clix though. It's very easy to use.  You can drag and drop.  It was the first one I owned and the easiet to learn.  The manual isn't the greatest, but the tech support was helpful.  The only thing I wish that I currently have is more space.  Two Gb is better than 1, but I with it came with either 4 or 8 gig.  I can't think of anything wrong with it.  The earphones sound great but are a little big for my ears and my ears don't think they are that comfy.  All the headphones that came with all of my MP3s are too large for me and are uncomfy.  You will love this player"
electronics,8 of 21,1.0,Don't buy this product if you have a mac.....yet,"The promotional material tells you it supports Macs. Amazon tells you Slingbox supports Mac. Hell, you order it and it even says it supports Mac on the box. But when you open up the contents, all that's inside is a Windows disk. Strange. So, you go to the Slingmedia website hunting for Mac drivers only to find there are none! Not yet anyway. Apparently they're in a private beta test."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Bought it for range, but it was great for everything!","While my notebook came with an integrated network card, the range was terrible.  Installing this card resulted in access in places that were otherwise off-limits.  In addition, throughput is excellent, and lag when gaming is also excellent.  Installation was very simple.  Works great with my Linksys WRT54GS router at home and at corporate hotspots and VPN networks."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Plantronics Headset,"I like Plantronics equipment and only wish that the wireless version of their headsets were cheaper. I have a slightly older model of this headset at work and like it a lot. This particular head set, which I got for home is fine, but it has two small problems. First, for some reason they made the band that goes over the top of the head thicker. That means that it doesn't fit on the wire hook that extends from the back of the connecting box. This leads to more desk clutter and a tendency to get all the wires tangled. The second problem is that I have a small desk fan and if it is on when I'm using the head set, the sound of the fan gets picked up by the microphone and so there's an annoying ""whoosh"" heard by both parties. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,CANON I-9900 Printer,I was going to buy an HP printer as I usually do until I read some of the reviews on this printer and as I read from one to the next each persons review had the same language in it. Everyone said that this printer is UNBELIEVEABLE so I took a flyer on the recommendations. It was true every time I print a photo with this printer I say to myself or my wife when I show her the photo this printer really is UNBELIEVABLE
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Good buy and a nice case for the disks is included!,"Nice plastic holder, good price for the disks.  The color coding is helpful.  I get nice results when I use these disks for digital photos"

electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Great for the Notebook user.,"These speakers are pretty good. I bought these after getting to college. Back home, I had a Klipsch ProMedia Ultra 2.1 system with the woofer and everything. Have had it for 2 and a half years, still sounds just as amazing, only problem is its not that portable."
electronics,,4.0,Good Wireless Keyboard,I only use the keyboard and it works well up to 10~14ft away. Then it misses keys. I have a wired 5-button mouse which wont work unless you disable the wireless mouse.

electronics,,5.0,Great printer - easy to install,"This printer works wonderfully. You can even use the wireless feature if your computer doesn't have wireless. I have my desktop pugged into a wireless router. The router communicates wireless with the printer, and so I can print 'wirelessly' even though my desktop computer is not wireless."
electronics,6 of 7,1.0,Stopped working after 4 days,"After a couple of days of it working fine, it just crapped out. I was uploading songs to it when I got an error message. It wouldn't detect it when I tried to format it and did not detect it in the G drive. So I'm getting it replaced and hopefully the next one will be better. I guess the previous poster was right, because it was made in Taiwan, not Japan. So I don't know, maybe the Japanese ones are fine, but I'd avoid the Taiwan ones. Which is what Amazon shipped me.."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Works great for home or office,I agree with the other reviewer that the signal is much improved in this base rather than hanging off of the socket or the extension cord.
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,"Great piece of device, didn't expect it to be so big tho","The built-in speakers on my laptop sucks and I usually watch videos on it with a friend or two. It's quite impractical for me to tote speakers wherever I go. More convenient to bring around headphones. I gave Boostaroo a try to see if it's better than the typical ""headphone jack y-splitter"" thingy that I used to have. Boostaroo works like a charm! No loss of quality or volume at all across the 3 audio output (which was a problem with the y-splitter I used to use). Only one thing I have against it: it's size--it's quite a biggie. I know they had the dimensions of it in the specs. Didn't really pay much attention to it when I was buying it tho. lol The thing works great, but it doesn't really look cool when I use it with my iPod"
electronics,,5.0,"Great Price, Great Improvement to PC!","Very easy installation. Easier than i thought actaully. Just slid my pc box open, and popped this little RAM card in. Turned on PC and could tell difference right away. No problems, just improvement"
electronics,9 of 10,4.0,Foam replacement,"I've owned these headphones for years.  The foam pads have needed to be changed for quite some time, but I never knew where to get replacement foam pads.  The sound quality on these headphones is still good so I didn't want to get rid of them.  I looked online for replacement headphones and found they charge $15.95 a piece or as little as $2.95, plus shipping.  I suggest you check your local dollar store for cheapy knock off headphones that look like the style of the Sony Headphones and take the foam pads off of them.  Worked for me."
electronics,36 of 37,2.0,"Looks great, sounds bad","I have a 20"" Aquos and love everything about it, so when I needed a smaller set for the kitchen I bought this one. When I hooked it up I was very disappointed with the sound system. The sound must be turned nearly all the way up to reach normal levels and then the speakers sound ""tinny"". Not even as good as a 15 year old 13"" Sony. Took it back and the retailer admitted it was the weak point of the system"
electronics,1 of 9,1.0,The person who made this absolutely have the lowest IQ on Earth!!!,"Why make an ear bud if you can't get this out of the case? They should just wrap this ear bud in a wire in a case instead of this stupid circular case. i spent countless hours cutting it open just to get it out. When I did, it sounded terrible. one star because this doesn't allow me to rate a 0"
electronics,1 of 3,2.0,H03 error & solution,"Got this error on my Panasonic Portable DVD and did a google search to see what came up... found all these reviews. Very helpful, thanks folks! The trick with the back skip, pause and play buttons (three or four reviews below) works a treat (at least for now!). Certainly beats a call to Panasonic who sound less than helpful judging by previous reviews. Fingers crossed.."
electronics,1 of 16,4.0,I like this item,I like this pretty much ...I have 2 this type of items . it helps me alot in the power flactuations...very help full...Item.
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Works For Me!,"Well worth the price.  Works as advertised.  Love the instant on/off feature.  If you are looking for a cheap solution to portable tv and vcr use, this is it"
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Excellent Addition to my computer products.,"I am very pleased with the performance of this machine. I bought it to add dual layer dvd's and 16x burning to my aging Powermac G5 from Apple. It has worked perfectly for me and makes DVD's in about 3 minutes. A very nice touch. As a side note, I am a world traveler and I am planning on moving to London at the start of next year. I was afraid that it would not be able to go with me. But I contacted Memorex and it already is wired to work in the U.S. and Europe. That was a nice surprise. Buy this product, you will not be disappointed"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Good Product,It is nice and compact and easy to use. It also has a protective cover for the ports so that they don't get crap inside them when you are carrying it around
electronics,20 of 20,5.0,They last...,"I recieved these headphones as a gift back 3 years ago for my 18th birthday.  They've lasted all this time and still sound great, they have superb quality when used with my dell dj, cd player, everything. One of the ear pieces comes loose but that is due to my rought treatment not defective merchandise.  I highly recommend these as they are an exceptional piece of equipment for the price"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,AWESOME!! Player,"Got this for my wife and kid traveling outside the country and we liked watching the DVDs on this rather than our 27 inch tube tv. Colors are great, battery life is unbelievable. Short-listed Panasonic LS91, Sony FX8 and this and spent two days researching and decided on the Philips. GLAD I did that."
electronics,,5.0,"Love it, love it, love it!",Guess I can't agree with the review from the magazine printed here.  The mouse is certainly not over featured. I am left handed and am buying a second Intellimouse because it has been one of the only truely comfortable mice I've used.  
electronics,,5.0,Very Satisfied,Product was just what I was looking for and at the right price.  Could not have been happier with my purchase.  I will look for this vendor again in the future
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,The best case I have seen.,"  This case is perfect for the life drive manager, it fits like a glove, and nothing is ever going to happen to your device in this case. There is access to every port on the Lifedrive, and it is a very solid case.   "
electronics,0 of 2,4.0,Monster Cable RadiaPlay Car Stero ,Very good.
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,If I were an audiophile...,"If I were, I might give these headphones a 3, I don't know because I've never listened in top quality headphones. I read a lot of reviews, so I figured since I purchased these I'd give something back. But since I like to keep things organized, I won't jumble my thoughts; I'll put them in categories rated out of 5."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,It just works...,"I bought one of these based on the glowing reviews here.  This device is amazing:  does exactly what it's expected to do and it ""just works"".  One thing I would like to point out is that (unlike other electronics devices I have owned) the battery in the remote is standard and easy to find.  It uses a CR2032 battery which can be found at your local Radio Shack or online for MUCH less"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,"Great keyboard, worth the money",This keyboard has been great for me.  The bluetooth was key for my purchase and it worked flawlessly with my Thinkpad T42.  
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A  Perfect Fit !,"This is the second time I have purchased the Microsoft Optical Blue Mouse,"
electronics,5 of 12,5.0,Very Impressed,New concepts and designs.  I am a practical person and really have never spent more than 20$ on a mouse.  I have had previous experience with Creative Labs Mice and they have been some of the best I have tried.  When I saw this new mouse I thought that this was an interesting concept and decided to take this for a spin.
electronics,7 of 8,1.0,Never worked,"About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.  It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately .  I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs.  I hadn't tried to use it since.  Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars.  No luck.  The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in"
electronics,19 of 20,4.0,Iron-ons for shirts,I did a little more than the directions outline. I took longer with the ironing. I took 5 minutes to iron the items on. I pushed down hard when I did the ironing. My black and white iron on washed well. I washed the item inside out in the cold water. Dried it on gentle cycle and it came out fine. I just don't know how it will turn out after several washings. Let the printing completely dry before ironing it on. Take your time on ironing them. Take your time letting the iron on cool before peeling the paper off. It should work
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Four bars throughout the house.,"The device works as advertised.  My wireless router is in my den at one end of the house.  My wireless reception at the other end of the house was almost non-existent.  Now I get 4 out of 4 bars throughout the house and in my backyard as well.  Setup took about 10 minutes, including encryption configuration.  The ease of setup and reliability may be due to the fact that I am using a Belkin Pre-N wireless router.  But, the two Linksys wireless bridges throughout the house work just fine.  The best $40 I spent in a long time."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Good printer for Linux,"My home network has a mix of Windows and Linux PCs. Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that the Windows setup instructions are a bit murky, but I had no problems. Also, the HP Solution Center application is fairly unhelpful, if you need help. One demerit for weak documentation and software."
electronics,,4.0,Great Product,This webcam functions great but the image is not so clear (I was expecting too much from a webcam) as a camera. The headphone coming with the package is also very good
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,"My roommate's broke, then mine broke!","My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Great mp3,"there are only a few minor problems with it. One, there are no files to view the songs in but that is no big deal. The battery life is limited but it will get you through a long car trip easily. Many songs can be downloaded and the quality is very good. This is great if you don't want to spend a lot of money on something that may get beat up or you may loose"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Good Batteries,"Good Batteries, just make sure to handle them with clean hands for longer lif"
electronics,1 of 8,1.0,Great Range When It Stays Connected,Listen folks....
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Its ok...,"When I first got this item (from Best Buy for $99), I enjoyed it a lot. But now the little problems have gotten more annoying. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Amazing TV at an unbeatable price,"When I was in the market for a new LCD HDTV I looked in all the traditional places and eventually found this unbeatable deal.  This is a PHENOMENAL Television and I can't believe amazon is carrying it at 46% off.  I viewed and compared endless tv's at Best Buy and elsewhere and found nothing but models that were consistently priced at $1000-1600 with less impressive specs.  This set not only has both cable and over the air tuners built in but also boasts a 4000:1 contrast ratio and HDMI port.  Hands down, this is the very best value I have found anywhere.  It looks and performs better than any other TV I priced.  Feel confident in this deal"
electronics,,5.0,Professional Quality produces perfection,The quality is outstanding when used on a Canon printer. I have the i9900 and love the results
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Holder a Plus,Very good product. A plus in additional eqipt. Holder supports any situation. Great for beach or park
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Great product for the money,"This product is fast and easy to use. Set-up is a snap and it works great in hotels and conference centers!!  I use mine all the time., both in my hotel and on the road.  Easy to carry too!"
electronics,6 of 8,4.0,great deal,"for the amount i paid for this item it was great.  its a little unsturdy, but has a sends a great conection to the radio"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Where wireless won't reach,I have a Mac Mini hooked up to my home entertainment center.  The built-in wireless didn't work worth a hoot inside the metal frame where my entertainment gadgets are stored.  The Netgear XE102 was the answer to my problems.
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Awesome Receiver,"Can't ask for more, clear sound, nicely finished, easy to use and the best part is the iPlug just plug it and you are done, your ipod doesn't get power from the 12v oultlet of the car (better for ipod's helth) no interferience like FM modulators. It doesn't get any better for the price"
electronics,0 of 3,5.0,Excellent,I got all features I wanted and more. Phone is easy to setup and it's wi-fi friendly
electronics,,2.0,Annoying,"Bought to use with HP dv2000 notebook. Immediately experienced irratic control, then drop-out of bluetooth about every 2 hours of use. After 2 months decided it wasn't worth the hassle - bought a USB mouse which works great."
electronics,9 of 9,1.0,Guide / Info buttons only work with DSS/Dish Network SAT,"Attention digital cable subscribers, steer clear of this one. While it has buttons for guide and info, they only work when you are in &quot;Dish&quot; mode. The light doesn't even flash on this remote when you are in cable mode for these buttons! Ludicris! Luckily I bought mine from best buy, so I didn't have to pay shipping to send it back. :( Plus, it's large and ugly... 'Nuff said"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The best NiMH AA batteries,I use these batteries with the Energizer Quick (15-min) charger. It's important to note that these are the 2500 mAH batteries. Energizer also makes 2100 and 2200 versions that are sometimes erroneously listed as 2500 on others' websites. These are the real deal.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"It does the job, and then some","I have only recently embraced the Ipod craze and aquired a 30G video Ipod.  The general audio quality of most MP3's just leaves something to be desired on the high and low end.  But, now that I have an Ipod, I have to hook it up to my home A/V equip.  The Homedock Deluxe handles that job very nicely.  The onscreen music navigation works flawlessly for me, and much better than my Showcenter 200 wireless media adapter.  I connect through a pretty good Denon AV receiver to an LG LCD tv and I am very satisfied with both the picture and sound.  The S-video is a must on my HD tv, but the composite was fine for the 20 inch tube TV I also tested on.  Sound quality was on par with other Ipod docks that I have heard.  I do wish that video and picture navigation could be controled via the TV screen also, but I am pretty sure that this is Apple's evil doing, and not DLO's fault.  The USB port is a nice added bonus too.   "
electronics,26 of 28,5.0,Love it,"(This is my mom and dad's account, I'm really only 14, and named Kaylee) I have wanted an iPod for sooooo long. I saved my money and bought one myself, my parents did NOT pay for it. They color is even better than in the picture, which was a pleasant suprise. The earphones are really nice, not like the crapy ones all my friends have on their video and first generation nanos. The outside non-scratch is awesome. I got my iPod on Sept. 29 of 2006, (a friday) and left to go camping less than 4 hours later. Ofcourse I took my iPod with. We camped on DNR land in the middle of no where in our trailor. So I ran around, rode my dirtbike, climbed trees, and a whole lotta other stuff while carrying it in my pocket. I dropped it a few times, and it doesn't have a scratch!!!! The only bad thing is it's so small, and easy to loose. I recomend getting a screen cover though. But you really don't need a case to keep it safe, cuz that would just hide the color of your iPod. It has 4 great games on it, and stores a ton of photos. It loads super fast, and is easy to update. The color screen rocks to the fullest. It's definatly worth the money. Besides, it's a 4g which in my town niether Wal-Mart or Cosco carry, only 2g. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Not Reliable, but highly useful.","Recently the screen on my HP 10bII Financial Calculator stopped working.  At first I thought I simply needed new batteries, unfortuntally this was not the case.  I owned it for just over two years before it broke down on me.  So what did I do?  I purchased another one.  While I am disappointed with the reliability, I find it to be a highly convienent useful calculator.  "
electronics,,5.0,Very Good product - But Expensive,The product is very good.
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Great Combination,This combination of keyboard and mouse are awesome. It was a breeze to install even better were the included batteries so I did not need to hunt a pair down. The range and feel are great as well. Already reprogrammed some keys and they work great
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Altec Lansing IM4 Portable Audio System,"This is a good quality speaker for 1 room performance.  The sound reproduction across the range is very good for a small compact unit.  It folds neatly, has it's own transport bag and external 115 volt AC to DC adapter.  It also uses AA batteries."
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Hi-Fi is the way to go,"I originally got this item because all the I-pod docking stations seemed overpriced at $100 or more dollars-so what the hell spend a little more for the newest thing, right?  I was and am totally amazed by the freaking pure power and sound of this thing!  By far the best investment I have made-ever!  This thing rocks my whole apartment-you will be stunned at how load it is.  Now when I go to my pool in the center of my apartment compound, I through a couple of batteries in it, set it on a lounge chair(with my handy shuffle-sized remote in 2 ziplock baggies) and float on a pool lounge shuffling through my entire music collection.  BUY ONE"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Good for the home or home office.,"I have not used all the features as advertized.  But I have used the printing, copying, and faxing options and the printer works as promised"
electronics,5 of 10,5.0,It's OK,"This is only for people with wide arms. Also it is only good for running. I don't recomend this. You should buy an iSkin, its an investment but its great"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,AMAZING!  But...,"I've had these headphones for about a year now and for much of that time, I was frustrated because of two things: 1) The bass wasn't as strong as advertised 2) The headphones kept slipping out of my ears while I was walking.  "
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Value for money,"Nothing great - don't expect to have long-life and high drain. But if you want a bunch for use in all the kids' toys, clocks, alarms... good dea"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,NetGear  -  NOT!,I'd stay away from this one.  Issues with Windows XP SP2.  Netgear does not seam to be able to get all the  bugs out.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product. A little pricey but worth it.,I use my Microsoft GPS on my computer in my car. I could not hear the voice directions through my small notebook speakers. I wanted something that would solve this problem without taking up more space. 
electronics,,4.0,Like every other Linksys product I have purchased...,"...plugged it in and it works flawlessly.  Some have complained about how close the ports are, I can see that, but if the box was larger, others would complain about that instead.  For me it is ideal."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Amazingly small but enormous capacity!!!,The perfect addition to my cellphone - capacity for over 150 ripped CD songs and more pix than I can count.  Comes with normal-size SD carrier so you can plug it into printer or card reader.  Cool product
electronics,4 of 9,5.0,Great Speakers,I am very impressed by the sound quality of these speakers and they were very easy to set up too
electronics,,5.0,Perfect ,"Is perfect for me, fits exactly, a its perfectly secure on mi belt."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,takes a licking...and keeps on ticking,"just the like the reviewer below, i accidentally put my cruzer through the washer...AND the dryer.  i pulled it out after my clothes finished drying a i was SURE i had firstly waterlogged it, and secondly fried it. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent phone,Best phone I've ever had. Good clear signal everywhere in the house. Lots of nice features. Up to 100 memory locations for storing frequently called numbers (I only need 20). Programmable ringtones so you know who is calling as soon as you hear the ring
electronics,56 of 57,2.0,"Great product, terrible cost.","Have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you ""an arm and a leg""? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they're just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables."
electronics,20 of 20,5.0,Cheap - Simple - can't go wrong,"I wanted to buy a RJ45 network cable crimper so that I could make my own cables (to network my house) but I didn't want to spend $30+ for most of the crimpers out there. I found this Belkin crimper on Amazon, and for the low price, I figured why not.  Well, I got it today and have already crimped several ends. It has everything you need if you're just looking to crimp RJ45 cables. If you're looking for lots of features, it's not for you, but its a perfect solution for network admins or household users that need to make their own network cables but don't want to spend money for overkill"
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,This cd case suck!!,"I bought 2 because it was at a great price.. After it was full of DVD,s it was hard to close. The zipper sliped off the case and will not stay shut. When the case is open the DVD,s slide out very easy. And the last thing is, now I have 2 broken dvd cases and three insert because one broke in half. So thanks for nothing Xtreme."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great.,High speed reader that works flawlessly and at high speed. All you need for your card and computer
electronics,,5.0,Cables to Go,I was very happy with Amazon buying service and the USB To Db
electronics,,4.0,Good case,Very good case for $5.97.  The zipper does not work properly but I dont care for that as you won't get such good case at this low price
electronics,2 of 27,5.0,512MB Cruzer Micro Drive,"I bought this 512MB Micro drive here for price and his rating. True to his word, I received the drive in record time and it functions great. I would recommend this seller to everyone. I look forward to future purchases. Thanks!"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Neat & Elegant,I bought two pairs of speaker stands for my BOSE lifestyle system. One was BOSE standard speaker stands and the other Atlantic. There is huge price difference between the two. 
electronics,10 of 12,2.0,save your $,the E2c headphones come with a small sheet of these... they're essentially a fine mesh circle with a ring of glue around the edge.  five pairs of these are NOT worth $9.  i've used my E2c headphones for nearly 2 years without using the wax guards and have never had a problem.
electronics,,1.0,Do not buy this product,"After 10 years of using Polycom ""star"" conference phones at the office with success, I purchased this model for my home office.   I've had nothing but problems.  The first one stopped working for no apparent reason after 3 weeks of use.   The first week it kept dropping calls.   The manufacturer's technical support staff suggested that I had a power surge and suggested plugging the unit into a surge protector.   Had already done that, and same with phone cord.  I am using a regular hardwired line, not VOIP or such.  And no problems with my other equipment including office laptop and personal desktop and printer.   I had to talk to the ""second level"" of customer support, as I was told that I could only receive a ""reconditioned model.""  Unacceptable customer service, as I'd originally bought what I expected to be a brand new, unused model, and had used for less than 3 weeks.  ""But it sort of did work some of the time...."" said the technician.  No dice here.  I was put on with the next level of tech support and assured that I would receive a ""new"" unopened, unused model.  The second replacement unit stopped working and all lights on the phone were lit one morning and no dial tone or electrical power to the unit, less than a few days after I had received it.   Was told again that I would be receiving ""new, in box"" model.  The third replacement (and the last that I will accept) just quit working this morning (holds a dial tone for 5 seconds, then dies, same problem as the first unit I'd received), and was in use for only 2 days for a total of two phone calls.  (exceedingly embarrassing to call in to your boss' boss' staff meeting only to have the unit drop 5 times during the call).  I still have the second unit which has not yet been returned to the manufacturer, as it is to be returned within 5 business days.  Just packed that one up yesterday.  I will say that my colleagues thought that the phone sounded excellent, that the speakerphone was so good that they couldn't tell I was on a speakerphone, but hey, if the unit craps out after a short term of use, none of that matters.  I would assign zero stars if possible.    Don't waste your time or money on this model."
electronics,,5.0,No more broken CDS,I also purchased a 3.5 mm input/output cable and hooked up the ipod directly into the 3.5 mm output of the belkin charger and the aux input of my car radio.  I like the velcro attachment to manage the cords.  It is a must have.  Now I don't have to worry about accidently breaking my CDs
electronics,28 of 30,5.0,Simply Awesome!!!,I have been considering the Slingbox for quite some time.  I decided to go ahead and buy one when Sling Media came out with this new model.  
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Sony - Pricey but worth it,The Sony Memory Stick is more expensive than equivalent memory sticks - but I think it is well worth the additional cost. It has worked flawlessly in my digital voice recorder
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Cheap upgrade for Magellan Merdian GPS receivers,"I bought one of these for my Magellan Meridian GPS (green / brown).  It works flawlessly and is MUCH cheaper than the Magellan brand Secure Digital Cards.  Note: depending upon what version of the firmware you have for your Magellan Meridian, you may need to upgrade to access this large of a memory card"
electronics,11 of 11,2.0,"Nice, but overpriced for what you get...","This comes in really handy, but I was surprised it didn't come with an extra set of cords for the price. I basically paid $40 just for something to sit it up at an angle. If I had known that, I could have made my own stand. Apple really should either give you two dock kits for the price of one or include an extra set of cords (which would come in handy!) with the packaging. I wouldn't buy again or recommend unless the price dropped by about half the cost"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Exceptional Photo Paper,I used this paper with my Canon i950 printer and the results were indistinguishable from photo lab prints.  I've used other photo papers and have achieved good results but none that compare to what this paper will produce
electronics,17 of 17,5.0,Finally!  A multi-line corded phone that works.,"I've been looking for a multi-line corded phone for months, and thought I'd found what I wanted in the AT&T 992, which recently became available.  It had all the features I was looking for, but the phone did not work reliably.  I bought and returned three of them, all with a different problem."
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,NuLOOQ-Excellent!,Logitech scored a big plus with this item.  The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly.  The first review is really unfair.  Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous.  Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did.  Good job on this one. I recommend it highly
electronics,7 of 8,4.0,Professional Networking Experts View,THE GOOD:
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Definitely a useful time-saving tool,"This diagnostic card will save you time when coming across suspect dead motherboards or cpus; or possibly defective RAM. I was able to save to diagnose a dead socket 370 cpu the first time I used it. Saved me close to half hour of reseating parts (memory, board jumpers, etc)."
electronics,3 of 8,1.0,Piece of garbage,"This router is a piece of garbage.  I've known several people who have these (or the 4 port version) and they all have problems with  it locking up, and there is no way to fix it besides pulling the plug.  There ought to be a class action lawsuit against Linksys for making a product this poor - there is simply no excuse.  Didn't they do any testing at all before releasing it to the public???"
electronics,1 of 5,2.0,DISPLAY GOES BLANK AFTER 3 MONTHS,"THE DISPLAY GOES BLANK AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USE, SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS YOU WILL NEED IT, TO RETURN THIS LEMMON"
electronics,,5.0,An amazing device,"I purchased a Sonowave USB WITH Radio 4 month ago at five time the cost of this item and it has already died. This FM transmitter performs just as well, and it is possible to set use this as an independent sound device to transmit internat radio stations or mp3's on your own computer, while someone else listens to entirely different audio through the computer speakers or headphones (avoiding a lot problems in one computer, two or more person households)."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent item without paying much,I am very satisfied with this piece of Belkin FireWire cable. I am getting more than expected results. Thanks
electronics,3 of 8,4.0,Nice Sound,These buds sound great. My only complaint is the short cord since I listen from a PC not a personal player
electronics,2 of 5,5.0,really good buy!,"good value for money, sleek black look, easy to use functions, and it's lightweight as well. highly recommended"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Nextar 512 MB Digital Player,"The sound quality is excellent and this is a good buy for the money.  The instruction manual that came with it is hopeless, however, and I had to go to the Nextar website to discover that it needed to be reformated before I could download music"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Does the Job,These are good velcro ties. They are basic (but colorful) solutions
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Stunning Sound,"I first should mention that from my birth up until today, the only sound I've ever heard from a computer is onboard audio played through cheap speakers.  I recently bought a decent sound card and I realized the built-in speakers on my moniter just weren't cutting it.  So, I ordered these.  A shipping center must be close to my house because I received my new speakers the next day on standard shipping.  I paid about $35 including shipping, but these speakers are easily worth $60+.  Stunning, clear sound and incredible bass is the only way to describe it.  I'd recommend these even if you still plan on using onboard audio.  The only negatives are that I didn't buy this sooner and the knobs on the subwoofer are in the back"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Great little, no-frills, ethernet switch!","We replaced three old 10-baseT hubs with the Netgear FS116 and our network has not only been MUCH faster, but seems to have a whole lot less trouble."
electronics,2 of 7,1.0,Too bad,"Unfortunately, the unit failed on the second day of use. It tries to self-calibrate every time it detects a signal, starts beeping and displays ""Service required"". That's too bad as it worked great if only for one day."
electronics,,1.0,"Please, spare yourself the trouble","Well first the description is very overstated. I went out looking for some surround sound speakers to replace my ones i have now (which arent bad), and found something that looked good on paper (the box), but dont sound nearly as good. I didnt set it up in the room, I noticed the wires are very short, I like to atest the speakers just out of the box rather than set it up and be dissapointed, i put on one song (rap), and it sounded at first like a pleaser, but when I turned the volume up, the bass distorted. The flat panel (and somewhat heavy) speakers aren't really that bad, but the sub isn't that good. It distorts very easily and I dont reccomend this to music- people. The bass isn't bad at low volume though, but you really can't push this system far without it interfering with you (attempting) to enjoy your music"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"So good, I bought it again!","This is the second time I have purchased this exact same radio.  I had to replace it, since I dropped the other one on it's head one too many times.  I use this radio daily when I am out walking dogs.  The reception is great, it has a good sound for being such a small speaker, and it lasted a long time, considering that it took quite a bit of abuse"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Canon makes the best and least expensive inkjet to run,Some people really should not listen to some people around them that get them all hot and bothered with innacurate information.
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,Backed up some movies and not even 1 played well.  They either skipped or didn't play at all.  I backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files won't even open... says damaged or corrupted files... ABSOLUTE JUNK!  I will stick with Verbatim from now on
electronics,4 of 7,5.0,JBL Onstage 2 Is Great!,This is a great solution for my desk!  Small and compact it still puts out great sound. 
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,It is what it is,"For those who expect true 5.1 Dolby Surround out of the Bose 3-2-1 system, please look elsewhere. This unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area. You need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised."
electronics,,1.0,Break too easily,"I had no problem with sound quality, fit or noise canceling. I never travelled with these or jogged with them or ran over them with a steam roller; I just listened to music in bed at night while reading. And they broke. Sony could care less - replacements cost more than new and have no warranty. Good performance, reasonable price, junk construction, hideous customer service"
electronics,6 of 7,1.0,Functional but sounds fuzzy,"At first I really liked the features and successful company backing offered with these radios.  Then I ordered them, tried them for an hour and ended up hating them.  The funtionality and ergonomics are great.  They feel fine in your hand and the quality of the buttons, screen and range are fine -- BUT!  I couldn't understand a word a person was saying into the other radio.  At any volume level it was fuzzy, muddy and completely distorted.  This was equally irritating on either radio.  There was no interference, no static, just inconceivable communication.  I also tried other GMRS radios from other manufacturers and found some to be identical, and one to be perfect.  Among the others was another Motorola brand that was much higher in price and featured higher quality, but sounded exactly the same.  So I think it's a design flaw in thier speakers.  Fix that, and future models might turn out fine"
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,Whimpy,Works good on short distance but not for the long haul. 30 foot ok 50 I wouldn't count on it

electronics,10 of 12,1.0,9 months of use and lost all data,"After loving this device and using it for school, I lost a whole semester of data b/c the USB contection for the device has become unwired due to normal wear and tear.  Unfortunately, I  will have to pay between $500 to $1500 to recover the data.  Don't waste your money.  Find a more durable product"

electronics,,5.0,Easy setup and operation,My family finally teased me enough about our 1990ish Sony phone.  Bought this one and couldn't be happier.  Have not installed a camera on the system so I can't comment on that.  Everything works great and it was a snap to install and setup
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Good card, bad software","I bought this card and only kept it for a week because it was incompatible with my laptop. That's not to say the card itself was the problem, I do believe it may have been overheating my laptop and/or it was drawing too much power. I'm not positive. However, it did run and connect to wireless network just fine. I believe I would have been satisfied had there not been problems with my laptop."
electronics,,5.0,Netgear Wireless Range Extender Kit,The range extender worked great. All I did was plug in the base unit off the router and then plugged in the receiver in our bedroom. We already were using a Netgear router so it went without a hitch
electronics,,4.0,Good cdr's for the money,"I like these cdrs the payback sounds great, only problem I have is that I use nero and I dont know if its nero or the cdr's sometimes they dont burn right, so I will have to assume its the program or my burner.   I like these they take abuse good Cdrs for the money I reccomend i"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Very Happy,"I have purchased numerous gamepads in the past, and have eventually returned or sold them, as I could never get the buttons programmed to all the key features I needed.  With this pad, I am pleased.  The buttons can be programmed to any keystrike you like, and there is even a shift button, just under the base of the thumb, which essentially doubles all the buttons.  It does take a little while to get the hang of the program software, but once learned, it is seamless.  I have played Half-Life 2:episode one and Darwinia, freed of the key board.  Each game has a different profile which is easily loaded prior to starting the games.  Of note, this keypad only works with the left hand, leaving the right to drive the mouse.  Not a problem for me, but I know some people shop at the Leftorium, and this may not accomodate them.  Also, tho it looks like the distance from the handrest to the keys may be adjusted, they are actually fixed.  The thumb dongle, however, may be tilted and slid in an out.  The silver knob on the side tightens and loosens the bar which lets it slide."
electronics,,5.0,At Last a Phone System for us.,"We tried a half dozen other brands and 5,8 GHz systems and took them all back. Not this one! It's perfect. Easy setup, superb voice quality, all the features we deem necesary, a great easy-to-use manual, and well designed versatile controls."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Purchased for the software, very satisified",We purchased this product for the software.  It is much easier to update the address book using the laptop than by using the little bitty phone keys on our RAVR phones.
electronics,0 of 3,5.0,why amazon slower than 3rd party delivery?,I ordered the keyboard and BF2 keypad combo for $53.
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,what high-speed usb connection?,"this product would not work with my dell dimension desktop, even after i installed a pcia card with high-speed usb2. very poor technical support from h-p (india). what ever happened to h-p quality?"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great product fot the price...,"Purchased these headphones to listen to DVDs on a flight to Las Vegas. The sound quality is great, especially listening to music!!!! They are comfortable and the hard storage case that comes with them is a bonus. The headphones are well crafted. Cancelling background noise is only average, but at this price, that is most likely all that can be expected. For the cost- to this reviewer they are a wise investment."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Just love it,"I was a little concerned, after reading some of the other reviews and being a computer novice, that I might have some trouble using this hard drive. Not in the least. It was extremely easy to use and very effective in helping me make all three of my computers at different locations the same. Also, I downloaded many memory-consuming files such as pictures to the hard drive for storage. This seemed to speed up two of my computers that are older and don't have endless memory. I am very pleased with this drive in every way and wish I had gotten it sooner"
electronics,,5.0,Great!,"This keyboard is great.  It has very comfortable typing positions, and the special function keys are also great"
electronics,,4.0," Sent from the digital God's but, ridiculous price","I love this Sony 4 GB High Speed Memory Stick PRO. It's fast, it has lot's of space, & easy to use. It can save up to 3,000 photos on one of my sony digital cameras (DSC-p93) at about 5 mp, also it can save about 18000 at VGA, and it can save about 1hr of video (mpeg 1) at 640x480. But It's just that it cost to much money. I payed less for my external 200gb hard drive. So took away a star for that. Quick note: The price has gotten a lot better since it first came out though. The only reason I got the card at this price was because, spring brake was coming up. The price may not be the best. But it really felt good not to run out of space"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Buyer beware: Don't buy this product without extended warranty,"The 40GB click wheel iPod I bought for my husband for Christmas last year died (hard drive fried) 360 days after he opened the box but one year and 3 weeks past when I bought it.  Appeals to an Apple Store and the ""Apple Cares"" (how's that for an oxymoron?) phone line fell on deaf ears.  They were unwilling to make any exception or provide discounts on a replacement, ""...our warranty clearly states...from the date of purchase..."".  So, in all caps, if you must buy an iPod, BUYER BEWARE! Think of this as a disposable purchase that will only last as long as the warranty"
electronics,,4.0,ZIP-LINQ ZIPROAD-KIT Road Warrior Kit,Good!
electronics,,5.0,The best you can get!,"Even though I've always thought these batteries are a bit overpriced, they definitely live up to their name: They are MONSTERS! Never fail ... always in top condition powering my digital camera. Their charge lasts much longer than ""regular"" rechargeable batteries ... usually much more than expected. 5 stars"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Very nice product,"I just bought one of these for use with an older 30GB iPod and a new Nano.  Installation took about 10 minutes using the provided template.  It's the perfect ""morning"" device, enabling me to listen to TV channels, weather forecasts, radio stations, or my iPod while making the morning coffee."
electronics,,4.0,anti-static wrist band,"Arrived on time. The cord could be a little longer to allow for more freedom of movement. Overall, a good product for the price"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Great Product!,This is a very good calculator.  Would recommend it even for the beginner!  Ease of use and quick to learn it.  Just my humble opinion
electronics,,5.0,This is a superb card. Period. ,"I have an older Aironet 350 802.11b card, and decided to upgrade to get the better range and speed that this card offers (not to mention full support for WPA-PSK AES; my 350 only supported WPA-PSK TKIP). "
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Lousy TV-Lousy Customer Service from Phillips,"I bought this TV for my kitchen in Jan. 06. It is used very little (I don't cook much!) By March 06, the picture would shut off in about 20 minutes but the sound would remain on. We were told to send it back (we paid the $25.00 shipping) and they would fix it. They sent it back saying nothing was wrong. THEY WERE WRONG! Now I was told to send it back again(we pay the $25.00 shipping again) and they will send me a new one! I agreed to pay the first $25.00 but didn't feel I should pay it again when they didn't fix it the first time! They refused to budge. So I guess I am out $50.00 bucks and they are sending me another lousy tv. What's that one going to cost me? Stay away from this t.v. and stay away from Phillips"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great GPS,This is my first GPS and now that I've used it for a month or so I don't
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Great portable speaker system,"We think this speaker system has great sound and is very easy to carry around.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is the odd decision to include a storage bay, but not make it big enough to hold the power brick.  So now if you need to bring the power cord, you have to worry about two things.  I don't think it would have been very difficult to make the storage bay a little bigger, the brick a little smaller, to make it even more convenient.  Still highly recommended!!"
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,A Nightmare!,"1) The driver/software package is as large as a small OS. Sometimes it will print, sometimes it will scan. Most times it will do neither. Many times I have had to reboot to make the damn thing work at all. The driver package takes forever to install. Save your money, I wish I had"
electronics,,5.0,Great little device,I just got this little device and I love it!  I have my tower underneath my desk so having to crawl underneath to plug in and unplug my wires for my speakers/headphones-it was becoming a real pain in the neck.  Its very unobtrusive and sits within my reach to click the button to have speaker sound or headphones.  Would definitely buy if looking for something to give you more accessibility to your sound card inputs
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great little product!,"I read a lot and I was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page.  I also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page.  Well, I finally decide to try this nice little invention, and let me tell you, it's definitely worth it!  It's cheap, but the plastic works fine and does the job well.  It stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised.  The stand is adjustable.  It's great, it makes my life so much easier, and I'm sure glad I bought it"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Great MEMORY CARD!,"I purchased this for my new Sony T-9 digital camera, and so far... all has been PERFECT.  Just click it right in, and you have a GIG of space.  I've been shooting pics like crazy!  Throwing in a 640 FINE movie mode to boot... and still have room for a ton of pics!  Love the card, LOVE the camera!!"
electronics,3 of 8,1.0,Avoid MEMOREX dvd media if using NEC 1300a,Use Maxell or Fuji disks.  They work flawlessly
electronics,,1.0,A bad product all around,"I bought this because I got a good deal on it at a local store. However, after setting it up and not being able to get the router to work without frequent drop outs requiring a reboot, I went online to check reviews. I was amazed to find that nearly everyone  here has had the exact same experience as me. This product must be faulty in its basic design. "
electronics,,5.0,Great deal!,"This is a very nice printer, especially for the price. Quick printing, good quality"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,works great,I just got the router with a netgear card to replace my old D-Link router.  The D-Link was a 802.11b router and one of my laptops had an 802.11g card that would not find the network even though it should be backwards compatible.  with the new router the laptop detected the network right away. With the netgear rangemax card on another laptop the connection is great.  I have better range all around the house as well
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Strong, simple, useful. ","Easy to apply, fits perfectly, doesn't slide, easy to clean w/ soap and water. Picks up fine dust easily, don't leave it in a purse or bag w/ crumbs and dirt in it, or you'll be cleaning the skin more often than usual. Course, it keeps all that [...]for scraping against the Zen and maring it, so even if it holds onto some of the dirt on the outside, it's still doing it's job as protector."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,DO NOT BUY,If at all possible do not buy this gadget!!! It is a nightmare keeping the cable plugged into the little door it has as a connector. It breaks very very easily. Worst engineering I have ever seen especially from Linksys!!! They are a trusted company but I threw mine in the garbage today and GOOD RIDDENS!
electronics,0 of 4,4.0,Very useful,"I bought this graphing calculator for my nephew.  And it has been a very useful tool for him at school.  It's easy to use, and handle.  The mannual is very explicit, and easy to understand"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Nice gps/radio combo,"I have a rino 110 also but wanted the 120 for the mapping capabilities. It is worth the extra money because the rino 120 comes with the pc interface cable and a basemap of highways and routes. I bought the metroguide software and was able to install 4 area maps onto the 8 megs of memory. The unit works well when navigating around town. Radio range is expected with the 1/2 watt frs radio. When I received the unit, it had a minor defect. I returned the unit to garmin tech support and I had a replacement within 8 days. The 120 does have some features that the 110 does not have like vibrate, voice scramble and the ability to send a text message. It works well with my other rino 110's and I am happy with my rino 120."
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Don't be Hasty,"most new laptops come with Good Enough sound quality.  Most speaker systems will Fake high quality.  Don't be hasty and buy a card before you've tested your laptop with your speakers.  If it isn't good enough, then look at something like this.  But it's so much cheaper to get the right soundcard integrated in the first place... what kind of laptop are you buying anyway if you're willing to spend 99bucks on audio for it, but not willing to fork it out in the first place?"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great 2 Line Phone System,This is an excellent product.  It works flawlessly and is very easy to set-up. 
electronics,20 of 21,5.0,Plantronics CS50-USB wireless headset works extremely well,The Plantronics CS50-USB wireless headset works extremely well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional software! This  wireless headset is comfortable and it allows me to travel a considerable distance away from the computer to dictate without significant degradation of signal.  The system will accurately transcribe my dictations when I am four rooms away from my computer and even when I'm outside the building.  This wireless headset works as well with my system as the microphone originally supplied with the Dragon NaturallySpeaking software (Andrea Antinoise NC91).  Both microphones achieved a very high score when training the Dragon NaturallySpeaking software.  I use the wireless Plantronics CS50-USB as my primary microphone because it is so much more convenient to work hands-free at a considerable distance from my computer.  
electronics,,4.0,Coby TF-DVD7050 ,"Unit works well and have had it for a couple of months now with no problems.  The only issue is that the screen is very easy to scratch and my 3 1/2 year old proved that within a couple of days.  The scratches are not noticible when viewing, but Coby needs to improve their scratch resistance in the future"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great product,"A great improvement over my built in Realtek audio on my Toshiba laptop.  I usually use my laptop at my desk, so USB was fine for me and I didn't really want to spend the extra money on a PC slot sound card.....and now that I have this I'm glad I didn't.  Just be sure to get the updated drivers from the creative site...they make it sound a lot better than it does with the default microsoft ones"
electronics,13 of 14,5.0,"Actually, Quality Does Matter","First, disregard my rating as I don't actually have these cables. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,This is a steal,"I bought for my RCS Lyra 128 MB and it added 136 more songs.  The transition from songs on the device and songs on this card is seamless.  The speed must not matter on mp3 players.  I took an ad from Fry's outpost.com website for $24.99 and a local retailer matched it.  I dont know if the brand makes a difference in digital cameras, but this brand is great for my mp3"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great mouse,"This mouse really does what I need it to. It has all the basic buttons I'd need for media access in a remote, and as a mouse it has a nice ergonomic feel, good scrolling, and 2 nice thumb buttons for customization. What really surprised me is the range of this device. I went around 20 feet away from the computer and it still kept the signal going! I also like the fact that no battery power is wasted on an unnecessary laser light (and you can conserve battery life further by actually turning the mouse off via a switch). Holding it in your hand as a remote is obviously a bit unnatural, but not in any way that matters too much."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Excellent combo offer,The SD card is excellent and I love the high speed transfers through USB2 card reader
electronics,0 of 3,1.0,No Belt Clip Included - You Have to Order It!!!,I bought this phone today because I have an older model that I just love. 
electronics,,5.0,HP Graphing Calculator,"This calculator is a very useful tool for advanced mathematical courses. It has most of the functions which are necessary for Calculus and Pre-calculus. I think that whoever buys this calculator has excellent choice. The only thing is that this calculator is very complicated, making it very difficult to use."
electronics,3 of 6,2.0,Not for most iPAQs,"This case will not work with most iPAQ PDAs because it is designed for iPAQs with a side hinging cover.  The case actually attaches to the hinge of the cover, thereby replacing whatever cover was on the PDA.  Unfortunately, my hx2755 has a cover that hinges from the top, so this case won't really work for it.  Its a tight squeeze with the cover attached for my PDA to fit, but it does have some room for a few credit cards and maybe some SD cards"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Works fine for me,I have three of those discs set up as a RAID. They work just fine. The disks are quiet and don't get hot at all. Plus they look nice
electronics,24 of 26,5.0,GREAT VALUE!,"If you're new to the DVD arena, you might have tried to use the S-video cables that came with your DVD player. That's the biggest mistake to make. When I first used the cable supplied by the manufacturer I wasn't all too  impressed with DVD. After doing some research, I figured out that the  connection between the player and the television is the most important  aspect, second only to the type of player you have.  The Monster Cable  Super Video 2 High-Resolution Monster Cable made a world of difference!  There was virtually NO signal leakage or interference. Because of the  Monster Cable, I'm now hooked on DVD's.  In addition to the high quality,  this cable is also extremely affordable.  The only way to surpass this  cable is to spend MUCH MORE on ultra-high-end cables. You can't go wrong  with this cable and maybe you too can be a new found DVD junkie"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Garmin StreetPilot i5,This GPS system works very well. It does exactly what I need it to do - get me around in unfamiliar places.  It is light weight and easy to carry.  The screen is easy to see and the voice is pleasant.  The only drawback is that it is difficult to get it to stick to a window for long periods of time. Make sure that you re-adjust the settings for navigation before starting the journey.  Otherwise you may find yourself taking the shortest route when the fastest would be the best or vice versa
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,A must for laptops used as primary computers,"Our school system had just converted to laptops for administrators. After a couple of weeks of looking down at the screen, the neck begins to get a little achey, so I began to look for docking stations. The Kensington had good reviews so I gave it a try. Excellent!!! My laptop, 15"" screen, now sits level with my eyes. It's got USB ports so I attached a wireless keyboard setup which stays hooked up. The laptop slides out easily when I have to go to a meeting. I come back, slip my laptop into the station, hook up the single usb connection and voila! I now have a desktop."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Junk,"Marginally better than dropping your PDA on the floor, I guess. But only marginally - the Palm rattles around so badly that any major bump will damage it anyway. The latch is easily broken (mine took about 5 weeks to go) and can easily fall open anyway, and there is no access to any of the ports, so if you want to put this in your pocket and listen to music, you're out of luck."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Buyer beware!,"I bought this item for my wife and it worked wonderfully for a couple of months and then just stopped working completely.  After going back and forth with DLO customer service about the problem, I was told that the arm between the Transpod and the cigarette lighter ""requires maintenance and needs to be replaced about every 6 months"" and ""is not defective, but does require maintenance""."
electronics,,4.0,Useful for Skype,I bought the iMic so that I could use it for skype since my powerbook does not have a mic in port.  A very good product but it is rather overpriced
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very Nice,Recipient receives very nice picture and sound.  They say it sounds like I am in the room with them.  Easy to set up also
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Very Functional --- but there are better deals now,"The player works well.  Vey well.  The user interface is easy to use, it syns with Windows media player flawlessly, and battery life is very good.  Unfortunately, for about $40 more you can get a refurbished 20 Gig unit.  Most people don' have a library more than 5 Gigs, so, perhaps it doesn't matter.  Again, I am not disappointed"
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,Almost perfect!,"This case is the most pratical I've found. The Ipod is totally protect... the only characterisc to improve is related to the hold button protection: as it is difficult to ""lock"" and ""unlock"" the Ipod when it is into the ISkin case, we have or to take the case off (the left superior corner), or to use our nails to proceed with the ""hold"" - and this can damage the case, tearing it. "
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Good for what they are,"I owned a pair of bookshelf JBL's for 10 years and was very happy with their performance.  I'm not an audiophile but I did notice that these have a good range, nice lows and clean highs.  Better sound than I expected.  They're not fabulous, but they're good for small spaces"
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Great comfort,"After suffering with wrist pain from using the mouse, this worked great to ease the pain!  Nice comfortable solution to a tough situation"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,It's noisy and I found it useless,"The software installed easily and the device seems to work, except that there's a lot of hum, crackle and static, which varies depending on where I move it around.  It seems to pick up noise from my laptop if it's anywhere nearby.  I couldn't play a CD without getting crackling noise on the percussive notes.  I went back and forth with Creative Labs support by email for a long time.  They kept sending me off to do long laborious useless procedures.  I finally returned it.  I hope to get a refund, but I may be stuck with this thing if they say it checks out OK and send it back to me. Also, the software is minimal and the documentation is almost nonexistent, but for 45 bucks I could live with that.  But the sound quality makes this device useless as far as I'm concerned"
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,"Run, do not walk, away from this product and company",I bought my son the Creative Zen 6GB MP3 player for a gift less than two years ago.  After only normal use this player developed the same headphone jack problem that thousands of other suckers reported.

electronics,0 of 1,1.0,"Two pairs, both broken.","I made the mistake of buying a second pair of these, when the first ones broke within 60 days. They sound really good for the price, so I thought it was worth the risk. Unfortunately the 2nd pair broke after about 30 days. There is no information on Skullcandy's website about warranty or repair policy. I tried to contact them via their online form and have gotten no response. I guess that I am a slow learner, but I have now learned not to buy from them"
electronics,8 of 9,2.0,This is card running at 24X speed.,"I purchased this card from the market seller ""emartbuy"". This card in not running at 150X speed. It's write speed is close to 3.6MB/sec(24X). Don't buy it from emartbuy if you really want a 150X card. The card is okay to buy if you don't mind the write speed(24X)."
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,"Light, sleek and practical","Case came very quickly, my ipod fits snugly into the case and all ports are easily accessible.  I'm comforted in the knowledge that my pod is well protected from scratches or even an accidental drop.  It also adds a little bulk which is kind of nice if  you've got hands on the larger size.  The only question is where did they plan on the lanyard being attached?"

electronics,,4.0,Good Phone,"This is a good phone.  Caller ID works great.  So does voicemail indicator.  Easy to set-up.  The ringer is not very loud, and you have to include a 1 with your long distance numbers in your phone book because it does not automatically dial it.  Because of that, I give it 4 stars"
electronics,,5.0,Does what it needs to do...,I have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera.
electronics,,5.0,be careful of which magenta you buy,"This, like all Canon products I've come across is superb. Be careful though, to get the correct Magenta ink for your printer. I mistakenly bought the BCI-6PM (photo magenta) instead of this ink because I wanted to use it to print photos with my Canon MP780. I ended up with every color print coming out with a greenish orange pall. I spent hours trying to figure what was wrong (Photoshop color space, ICC profile, Printer drivers etc.). Simply substituting the magenta cartridge for the photo magenta cartridge instantly solved my problem"

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Patience during setup really pays off,"This remote does its job well. I had eight remotes to control the gear in my living room, and this thing took the place of all of them. I no longer lose them in the couch or forget where I put them last...and it no longer takes me five minutes to set up just to watch a movie or listen to music. Macros allow one button press to turn on (or off) all required equipment and set them to the correct mode. The backlight is pleasant, I like the audio feedback of button presses, and the sheer size of the thing feels good in my hands and prevents misplacement."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Perfect Size and Price,"Like another reviewer, I'm no longer impressed by the brand name vendors in this category.  This little card reader is small and flat, just right for tucking into a laptop bag.  It comes with a USB extension cable which I find more convenient than plugging the unit directly into the USB port on a laptop. Works great, too.  Just don't bother with the installation CD unless installing on an older version of Windows. "

AFTER OWNING IT FOR 3 WEEKS THE BATTERY QUIT CHARGING AND WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE ANYMORE.  SO NOW WE NEED TO SEND IT BACK TO LOGITECH TO GET A REPLACEMENT...SO AFTER SPENDING AROUND 150.00 FOR THIS WE NEED TO DISH OUT EXTRA MONEY TO SPEND TO GET THIS RETURNED.   I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.  THIS IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHES....THOUGH IS SOUNDS GREA"

electronics,4 of 4,4.0,I'll only use genuine Hewlett-Packard in my laser printer,"Okay, my printer, a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L, is not great.  Despite mechanical problems, it prints well.  Crooked, maybe, but otherwise well.  Using the real HP toner makes a difference.  The greys are more even, fine  lines are crisper.  I tried two versions of recycled cartridges and the  results were immediately noticeable.  Amazon has a great price on the real  ones, so it is worth it to stick with them"

electronics,18 of 18,5.0,Great but watch out for these reasons,"After reading how many people had problems I checked further. According to info from a forum at dpreview, these fast cards will fit, but not function properly on all cameras- you must check Sandisks web site for compatibility. Also, these fast cards need a card reader that has ESP capacity- A Sandisk description- for fast parallel processing- some card readers will corrupt files if they do not have this feature. You would think Sandisk would have a warning on the card packaging"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Great Product,"I am not really sure why the first reviewer decided to rant about this great keyboard but I have to disagree. The Merc keyboard has an awesome layout and has definately improved my key access to more complicated FPS style games. While it does install Microsoft's .NET, the only time the Merc software attempts to use an internet connection is when you initially launch the keyboard manager so that it can check for updates to the program. Without an internet connection the application launches fine while greying out the ""Check for Updates"" button. If thats spyware..... Also, while there are limited presets for games, how many people leave a games controls at the default? Any game player can select the default layout preset and then customize the game to use the key presses as desired. Configure the game to work how you want to play it, not how someone else thinks you should. All in all one of the best gaming purchases I have made in quite some time. The only reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is because I would have liked to have see a few more buttons below the movement keys as well as the thumb/pinky keys having been half sized and doubled for more options"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Doesn't work at all,"I have a 99 Suzuki Grand Vitara, and this cassette adapter doesn't work in the cassette player. As most of the other reviews state, there is some sort of tension problem that causes the cassette player to constantly fast forward and switch from side to side without ever getting into play mode - thus no sound. I tried it out in the parking lot of the compusa store where I bought it, and immediately returned it. The clerk recommended the cheaper store brand adapter, which works much better at half the price"

No silly rubberized appliques to peel off after a couple of weeks of good use.  Four nice, big Teflon feet, wide ""millipede"" scroll wheel, sturdy construction, and a great feel in the hand.  Light, small, and comfortable.  Clean, smooth tracking on uniform surfaces.  Extra long 6' cable is perfect for desktop situations where the CPU is a greater than typical distance from the mousing surface.  And the cable they used is of excellent quality that feels like it will last forever without twisting or snapping a contact at either the USB plug or mouse housing ends!  I have one on my laptop, and one on my dekstop.  They both perform flawlessly.  Good job Microsoft.  You got this one right"

electronics,67 of 73,1.0,The worst digital camera EVER made!,"At first i was enticed by the low cost of the digital camera as well as its sleek credit card look. To begin with, the instructions required that i wait for 4 hours before using the camera so that the battery could charge. I stared continuously at the camera for those four intense hours only to end up in agony and unbearable pain upon realizing that the ON and OFF button could only be switched with the use of a knife or sharp object. I figured ok.. no big deal i just need to carry a knife around with me but for a camera that looked so sleek, I was willing to risk it. "

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Extremely useful device,"This SanDisk reader makes it very easy to maintain a digital photo collection.  Before I bought one on an intuitive whim, I had been connecting my digital cameras to my computer.  What a mistake I was making.  The first time I used the reader, the response was instantaneous, and the transfer speed excellent.  I save battery power on the camera and time since transfer with a camera tends to be slower."
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Very good Joystick,"The X52 replaced my old X45 Saitek and I find it much better in every way from the old stick, very much more sensitive to stick input.  It is one of the most versatile sticks I have ever used and lives up to the praise that has been direct its way on this forum. If it had force feed feel to it that would have been awesome, but as is it is performs very well on the various flight sims. "

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,getting compatible hardware is the key to happiness,"After the truly dreadful set up attempt experience with a Hawking extender I was a bit reluctant to try another but the Hawking tech support and AT&T tech support copnvinced me that the problem was that the first extender was not compatible with the new model 2700 HG 2Wire gateway.  Boy were they ever on the right path.  I ordered the new one just yesterday afternoon and it arrived today!  (Normal UPS shipping-not ovenight). Setup wizard worked! Took less than 2 minutes and I was up and able to put in my wireless card in a 2nd computer way in the upper corner of the house (behind a fireplace) and it WORKED!  It sure is nice when that happens. The manual for this new extender is much improved and the setup CD is much bettter than the older one (that I returned to Amazon).  Also, this is the first time I have had to return something to Amazon and the process is very easy and helpful"

Once I finally found time to hook it up, I was unable to get either a test page or any documents to print. All it kicks out are blank pages.  Tried connecting it to both Mac & Windows computers without any success. Tried different USB cables, re-installed drivers, shook the starter toner cartridge, etc. No luck getting any successful prints yet.  Emailed Brother tech support & got a suggestion for resetting the printer, but still no success. Could possibly be a faulty toner cartridge, but at this point I'm still dealing with Brother support trying to find a solution.  An incomplete experience so far, but rather disappointing"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,3 iPods Replaced No Questions Asked,"I've had my iPod replaced 3 times in the second year of coverage--that's $1200 worth of merchandise--and once was my fault. Granted, the iPod shouldn't breakdown that many times in 2 years, but you have to face reality here: an iPod is a little computer with a spinning hard drive being bandied about like it's a cassette tape (assuming you don't have a mini iPod with a Flash drive.) The beauty also is Apple sent me a box paid all shipping both ways and the turnaround was always about a week, including shipping. The $59 is well worth it. Imagine treating your laptop like you do your iPod--an iPod is not a Walkman. And of course they're not going to replace it when you bring it in with a cracked display window. How on Earth is that their fault? That's crazy. That's like bringing your car in for warranty repair for a broken windshield and saying ""hey, come on man, I kept it in the drive way."

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,HDUP1500 HDTV Upconverter,"This is about the least expensive Scaler you will find, Period. I have a Home Theater system which includes a Front projection system with a D-Theater 40000u JVC VCR and a high end DVD Player. The Projectors native resolution is 1024x768. I set the HD VCR for 1080i and use the HDUP1500 HDTV to downconvert the D-theater to my projectors maximum resolution. The Picture looks great. I also use the Scaler to upscale DVD and it does a good job. When you enlarge a dvd Image without the use of the upconverter on a 100"" screen it doesnt stand up too well and Normal Televison fairs even worse. This scaler upconverts both and I cant begin to tell what an improvement this scaler makes on quality. One improvement they should make is to include an rgb connection. My projector does not have a component connection so I use a KDS Transcoder. While there are scalers that do a better job they dont come close to the bang for buck you get out of this unit"

Having used other radios during my ride was usually more trouble then they were worth, I was always losing a station or fiddling with the volume control due to a fading channel. The Coby CX-9 Locks on to a station and holds it without fade. One push of a preselect button and I have another favorite station to listen to. Very portable with belt clip. Great job Coby"
electronics,8 of 10,1.0,Samsung DVD-L75 Portable DVD Player,"Buyer Beware!  This portable DVD player was purchased as a present with the purpose of using it while flying on long trips, unfortunately you cannot hear it even with good headphones over the plane noise.  I took it to Best Buy today to see if there is something wrong with the unit.  The salesman in the tv/dvd department was not surprised by my complaint.  He said the Samsungs have a low audio output compared to other models.  He suggested I ask the Geek Squad in the front of the store to get their opinion.  The person I spoke with was very helpful and said this appears to be a problem with the Samsung portable DVD players from information he had found on the internet.  I ended up buying a booster for $34.00.  When I got home, I called Samsung and that was a waste of time.  Samsung tried to tell me all the manufacturers are having this problem with the portable DVD players and basically they do not care and will do nothing to insure customer satisfaction.  I asked him if Samsung would reimburse me the $34.00 I spent on a booster since their system's sound is inadequate.  I was told not to waste my time.  So much for customer service.  I will never purchase a Samsung product ever again and advise other consumers to do the same"

But the thing that prompted me to write this review is the very positive experience I have had with Brother customer service.  On two seperate occations I needed some help - when I called their 800 number I reached (in less than 2 minutes) very friendly and knowledgable humans who knew exactly what they were talking about and quickly solved my problems - in understandable, native english!  Keep up the great work, Brother"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Best for TV,"I've worn out one IR headset and three RF headsets since 1988 and these are the best by far for watching television. I can't address the issue of hiss mentioned by some reviewers because my  high-frequency hearing is impaired, and I don't listen to very much music, but for hearing dialogue on television dramas, the RS 140 can't be beat. The headset is comfortable, the cups cancel most external noise, and the controls are easy to use. I had given up watching most tv dramas because I could not understand the dialogue over the soundtrack. No more! I now understand every word! My wife, whose acute hearing tests way above average, even asked me to translate some dialogue from CSI Miami! I gave her my headset and had to plead to get it back! Now I'm trying to find an extra headset. I had no difficulty setting up the transmitter and I found the controls easy to understand and use. The only negative comment I can offer is that the Engish translation of the German manual could be better"

electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Works Very Well,"My primary need for an all-in-one printer are mainly for scanning, copying and printing documents. For these purposes the Canon MP830 performs very well.  Scanning speed is acceptable and the multi-sided scanning works like a charm.  The auto document feeder was especially useful for me. I would just load all the papers I want scanned and then just wait until its done.  I can either leave the computer or do something else as it works in the background.  The scanning software has some bugs but nothing that will bring down the system (although I do use a Mac and have OS X).  Copying, both B&W and color, also works fine.  I have not owned nor tried other all-in-one printers but the speed at which it copies and prints is fast enough for me.  I have not yet tried printing photos although it will be very rare that I would use that function."

electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Great for Mac OS X too!,"The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Another good Linksys product,I purchased this modem to replace an older (non-linksys) cable modem that had died. I was a little concerned about the version as I had read other reviews saying people had received ver. 2 or 3 from Amazon but I received a ver. 4 which (to the limit of my limited knowledge) is the most recent version. I had no problem getting it set up with Comcast and it has worked great so far. I have used a lot of Linksys products and have always been happy with them
electronics,20 of 33,5.0,"Great product, buy one today!  But . . .","don't buy it here.  Go to the Apple store either online or a retail location.  There you will get the product and support you need and you won't have to wait a month or so to get that wonderful Amazon message that says they can't fill your order at this time, but would you like to wait?  And after 4 months or so of not getting your new ipod, just try getting your money back from Amazon. "
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Didn't fit new nano,This product is not compatible with the new nano.  Doesn't line up/fit the base connectors
electronics,,5.0,A great product,The only thing I could get to charge my Ipod in the house.  I LOVE the remote control.  Would definitely recommend this to others
electronics,,5.0,Unbelievable Picture!,"I bought this to pair with a new Sony SXRD-KDS60XBR2 (full 1080P) television.  I'd read good reviews on upscaling, but after seeing so many poorly connected HD TVs in the stores, I wasn't expecting much, even from this.  But I wanted to move my current DVD player along with the old TV and decided to give this one a shot.  Oh Man!  Not only does the upscaling produce a fantastic picture from the DVDs, but it does a pretty good job on DiVX and even VCD (for what's it's worth).  As with everything, the quality of the source material has a great effect on the resultant image - DiVX and VCD don't shine like DVD.  One note for you - make sure you go through all the options with you first start up the device.  It does not default to 1080i upscaling.  Also, for the absolute best quality, go with ""super-bit"" DVDs.  An overcompressed movie will still look over compressed, even when on this marvelous peice of hardware.  Highly recommended"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Works great and is very detailed,"After you get over the disappointment that your Garmin GPS unit is useless without extra mapping software, you break down and buy City Navigator. "
electronics,,5.0,Sound Great,"These speakers are both stylish and sound great, a nice compliment to my first Mac computer"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Plantronics VoIP wireless headset,Easy to set up.  Little difficult to figure out operation instructions via pictures and cross reference several pages back.  Manual could be better written with more detail.  Overall product works great
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Works as advertised,This mount works very well.
electronics,,5.0,Great deal for the REAL thing!,"I couldn't match this price anywhere, especially with Amazon Prime ""free shipping"".  I destroyed my last printer trying to save $$$ using a refill kit....I warn everyone to buy the product replacement suggested by the manufacturer.  Amazon prices are hard to beat for the Real thing! "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Ipod armband,It's great! So conveniet to listen with my Ipod & it sure to be
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Rave Review,"This was purchased as a gift for a teenager.  Of course, having a way to project her ipod to play in her room was a big hit. Great look and shape of the product...."
electronics,,5.0,Perfect!,"This is the same cartridge I can purchase elsewhere, but cheaper.  It works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my HP printer prints fantastic photos when I use HP ink and HP premium photo paper"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,"Reliable, excellent product","In this world of many choices, it's a relief to know that there are brands which continue, again and again, to keep up with the quality they started with. HP is one of those brands. My 6540 is as good as my former 5150 printer, only faster and simpler to use. Thanks HP for a job well done. Thanks Amazon for carrying items like that"
electronics,,4.0,Great equipment,1. Excellent audio quality
electronics,,4.0,Better than the rest!,I've had this model for about a year and yes it has some breakage problems but still works well. I went out and bought a different brand for my dad and the transmitter was twice as much and worked half as well
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,won't fit your ipod -  don't bother with this product,"i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20 & 40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town.  However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly.  The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't.  The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button.  So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless.  pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case"
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Would be great if it worked,"The controller worked well while it lasted - which was exactly 2 days.  The left analog joystick went haywire and caused movement without even touching it.  All attempts to reset, including reistalling the software failed to correct the issue.  So, like any good consumer, I returned the product thinking I had a faulty controller.  Turned out the second controller acted up even faster - the same day."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Excellent telephone, headset needs improvement.","You should be aware that this phone is ""headset only"".  It is a simple hookup that allows for two lines using either an ""expanded"" modular plug to a single wall jack or two separate plugs to two wall jacks.  There are handy volume and tone adjustments.  The buttons are large and convenient.  You can initiate a conference call if you have two lines.  The only pitfall is the boom microphone which tends to pop off of the headset.  It snaps back in, but it can be an annoyance.  Plantronics offers headset upgrades (available at Staples, etc), or you can go with a competitor's headset that uses a standard 3.5mm single jack"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Great sound, and indestructible!","I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass."
electronics,9 of 15,2.0,Short Life,I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge.  It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life.  Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all.  Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning.  I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time
electronics,3 of 6,5.0,Flight Sim Yoke,"I'm very pleased with the unit.  I love the trim, throttle control and flap control features.  AAAA+++"
electronics,,4.0,"good, better with more bass",I like these headphones because they are comfortable and do a good job of isolating outside sound.  I just wish they had a bit more bass
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Good Sound For The Money!,"I bought these to use with an inexpensive DVD player and TV in our bedroom. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality sound for the money. Being the lazy sort, I wanted remote control and this system has this convenience. I am use to visual feedback with a remote, so I have to pay attention to perceive the differences as I push the remote buttons."
electronics,1 of 8,1.0,DOA,"Device was non-functional from the time I plugged it in, tech support was worthless and they wanted 10 days to replace it."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Wireless-B USB Network Adapter,Very easy to set up.  Using this unit on the 2nd floor of my home with a wireless router on the 1st floor.  Performance has been good
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Nifty!,"I like this little radio a lot! Along with my hounds, it's always my close companion when I do carpentry and exterior improvements on this property. I like that it's safety yellow so I can find it easily when it's sitting with tools and supplies (unlike a black radio). I like hand-crank feature so I don't have to run out for new batteries when I'm pinned down on some project. I left it out in the rain one day (Doh!), but it worked just fine afterward."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Superior performance from an over-the-ear headphone,"This is the best over-the-ear headphone that I have listened to, and inexpensive to boot.  I gave it my personal acid test with Bach's Toccata and Fugue in 9 Minor, and it passed with flying colors, rendering both deep bass and very high frequencies accurately and without noticeable distortion even when playing very loudly."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good buy,"Not the best quality sound, but perfect for running - doesn't cancel out all sounds so hazards like dogs and cars can still be heard. They won't fall of - even if you're sweating like crazy"
electronics,11 of 12,4.0,Lives Up to the Hype,"I have listened to the hype about TIVO for a couple of years now.  With the hundred dollar plus rebates on the hardware, as well as substantial discounts on the service, I thought I'd break down and give it a try.  Here' my experience..."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,"Yep, it's a power strip!","Uh, it's a power strip so what's to say? It works. You plug things into it, and they work.  Actually the best thing about this one is it comes with little stickers that you can attach to the end of plugs on your electrical devices so if you unplug something, you'll know what it is!  Though, it should include blank ones so you can name things yourself such as PS2 or ROUTER, things like that.  Anyhow this was a great price and this seller ships real quick so you can't lose"
electronics,15 of 15,5.0,Best One to Own,"I have utilized the RX 65 in over thousands of miles of highway driving.  It never misses, and it has saved me tickets everywhere.  One of the features I like best about this detector, compared to the Escort 8500 X50, which I also own, is the different sounds associated with each radar frequency range.  For example, Ka detection emits a chirping sound, different from the warble for K band,and the tone for X band detection.  This allows the driver to keep his eyes on the road rather than look at the radar detector.  At those highway speeds this is a great advantage in trying to locate the source of the radar.  "
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Does The Job - Very Pleased,"As others have said, it works as advertised. I am using it with an iRiver Clix MP3 player and Sony MDRv6 headphhones. The phones have a 63 ohm impedance, and the Clix just couldn't quite get loud enough for me with these phones. (Most mp3 players assume a 16 ohm impedance.) Under normal conditions, it was fine, but during my commute on the train, it just wasn't quite loud enough. Running at full volume caused the battery on the Clix to drain faster, also."
electronics,4 of 7,1.0,Totally disappointed,"I bought these speakers after doing an extensive research on thousands of options for mi Ipod, and unfortunately ended up buying the worst! The ""universal"" adaptor is so universal that does not work with any kind of plug. The only way the speakers will work is if you use batteries. The sound is not good at all for the price I paid for them."
electronics,16 of 47,2.0,Very Hard to Setup with I Tunes 7 in Windows XP,"I am a Microsoft Certified Professional, it took me 3 days to finally make my iPod to sync."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,"Great, but overpriced - other Canon paper just as good","I tested my new Canon i960 with a variety of papers. Like most printers, the output is MUCH better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive &quot;Pro&quot; paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between it and Canon's &quot;Photo paper pluss - glossy&quot;. There may be a benefit to the &quot;Pro&quot; paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - both papers will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)"
electronics,6 of 8,4.0,"Toshiba 27AF45 27""",I purchase this television for my daughter's home.  I'm the babysitter and got tired of watching a crappy tv every evening.  This television has a very sharp picture and the viewing is very pleasurable.  
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Dual Car Audio Quality,"I recently installed this unit into my 1995 Geo Prizm after the factory stereo lost its FM capabilities.  Installation was a snap with the purchase of an adapter plate and power wire adapter.  I left the speakers from the previous radio in the car...Boston Acoustics 5 1/4"" in the front and JBL 6 1/2"" in the rear.  AM stations sound like the factory's FM and the FM is so clear that I hear instruments in the music that I didn't hear before.  I must say that the Dual unit lacks a low end unless you turn on the ""loudness,"" and then it is adequate.  A large part of the problem is the JBL's in the back.  I do not believe they are capable of cranking out bass.  The stations pull in great on both bands and there are plenty of pre-select stations to program (6 AM and 18 FM)...I don't know what the local/distant feature does in this unit.  It doesn't seem to have an effect.  The CD player is very good...very clear and hasn't skipped when I am gone down bumpy roads and potholes."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,"Excellent product, especially for this price!","I was pleasantly surprised to see the picture and sound clarity on this product.....I earlier owned an expensive Philips portable dvd player, and this one is definitely as good as that! Excellent value for money.....i definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a portable dvd player..."
electronics,,5.0,garmin forerunner 301 gps,"I have had limited use of my gps due to my newness to running. However, from what I have been using on the forerunner 301 I have like the information I receive. I have recommanded it to people who are also interested in knowing their progress in their excercise program."
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,"Nice when it worked, but poorly made and unreliable","Nice gadget for the 1 year and 11 days that I had it, until it suddenly broke completely, for no apparent reason, and I had to buy a new player.  The warranty is 1 year!  $229 for a disposable MP3 player is a lot of dough."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Good Value,"They last almost as long as energizers or duracells, but cost way less. for the price it great value. not a mega deal like the memorex 50 AA pack (this is the only reason I am giving a 4 stars) , but still good if you know your usage will be limited"
computer &amp; video games,6 of 9,4.0,A good way to play classic games wherever with few flaws,"This is great even if you have the NES games. For one you can bring it anywhere and it doesn't have 2 player mode. It IS compatible with GBA SP because it does not require the game link port on the SP. The only flaw is you need to scan 10 cards to play one NES game and you can only save one at a time. Still, that won't stop you cuz when you get proficient at swiping them, its nothing. But the e-Reader does more than NES games; you may play e-Readers from Nintendo Magazines, you can play Game & Watch games, look at Pokemon (who cares about that feature???), connect to games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and get power-ups as well as new levels, and hook up to a Gamecube for double experience. The only problem is to connect to games you need 2 Game Boys and a link cable but that it isn't too much of a problem. Also, e-Reader packs are fairly cheap even in New York City. Gameplay and graphics are faithful to the originals, too"
electronics,24 of 24,5.0,Excellent product!!  This is the one to get!!,"I had been searching the internet high and low for a digital voice recorder that would fulfill my needs -- a quality voice recorder AND a suitable device that would record instruments -- staying up late nights, spending hours on live chats comparing products, waiting weeks for e-mails back from companies about their recorders, and then I found this and took a gamble.  And I won!  This thing is amazing.  The body is a little large to be an mp3 player, but, as another poster said, it's all about the recording.  The piano recordings sound almost professional, and the internal microphone produces a better quality sound than my $150 external microphone that I plugged into it!!!  My only qualm is that you must open a program in order to extract your recording and save it to your computer instead of the recorder simply opening like a drive, but after the first try this becomes a piece of cake.  Regardless, this recorder packs many helpful features and is extremely flexible in different environments.  There are many, many different voice recorders out there today, but this is one to get. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Canon BCI-6C Cyan Ink Tank,"I have tried 3rd party inks with my Canon i860. They work well for graphics, greeting cards, etc. but they do not give true colors for photographs. I will stick with Canon inks. Amazon has the best price I could find for Canon inks"
electronics,21 of 24,5.0,The Way it Should Be,"My wife and I had previously owned two Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 players and had many many problems. Mostly with syncing the songs onto the devices and also some with proper playback. The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod. So we returned the Philips players and got an 80GB and 30GB iPod. Neither has let us down once. They sound great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use). itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do. podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories. It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings. On the 80GB iPod we have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of our outlook contacts and it is only about half full. Not to mention the games that come with it. If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works. "
electronics,0 of 12,2.0,poor compatibility,while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Awesome Drive,"Nice,quiet and reliable drive.I don't care if it's only 2mb cache,what im looking for is long term reliability.This drive got the best reviews out of all of them out there,so i went for it and im glad i did"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best GPS receiver I've ever used,I was showing my new toy off at a gathering of GPS type people and the little gem managed to lock on to a signal inside in a metal roof building.  It is just that good
electronics,1 of 4,5.0,I own 1,"I am 13 years old and I own one! They are fantastic for all ages! It keeps me organized along with all my school assignments, activities, and contacts. It keeps me entertained anywhere I go and I can always play games or enter more information! I would highly recommend this product"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,It is simply the best,"Even If you don't own an Ipod(I do), this will turn your particular audio device(portable cd player...mp3 player) from a mediocre sound to a simply amazing, astonishing, marvelous sound. It is really like listening to it with headphones....maybe even better! Clean, Crisp, Tight sound. I have bose companion 2 speakers and can honestly say that the MM50's have a more enveloping sound. The bass isn't quite what the bose put out, but it is very tight and does sound very good. All in all, If you want truely great sounding portable speakers, these are definately at the top right now and the Amazon price makes it a no brainer"
electronics,,5.0,ipod review,This mp3 player has great sound quality with the ear buds provided. We had a problem with the first refurbished one we bought.  It suddenly froze up and could not be restarted.  We had great service from our provider who replaced it very speedily with another newer one.  It seems to be working just fine so far.  We are very happy with the capacity of storage and functionality of the Apple product. Very smooth operation and intuitive function
electronics,,5.0,Runners need this!,"This device is awesome.  I absolutley highly recommend it, especially since I used it on the treadmill and discovered the treadmill, all this time, has given me inaccurate distances.  I don't wear Nike sneakers, but it was easy enough to make a little pouch for the transmitter and pin it under my laces onto the tongue of the sneaker.  I love that it tracks my runs for me and graphs them so I can see my progress."
electronics,,1.0,Poor sound or bad luck?,"I just received the Sony MDr-SA1000 and bought it directly from Amazon.  I don't know if I received a fake or what but my headphones' box appeared scratched on the outside which made me question whether it was new, like the vendor claimed.  Despite this, the headphone itself seemed new/mint condition.  "
electronics,3 of 9,1.0,In-Line Unlike Others,"I was disappointed by this purchase. Unlike a regular inline volume controller that integrated with a pair of headphones, this does not amplify the sound coming from the device."
electronics,,5.0,This product is excellant.,This product is really great.  It is small and easy to use.  It fits in my briefcase with no problem.  The batteries last for quick awhile.  I have seen other wireless mouses and they are big and cluncky. Fine for at home but not traveling around.  This product is really good

electronics,1 of 8,5.0, Regarding Belkin F3U133-06 USB Device Cable ,I love shopping at Amazon. Quality products and fast efficient service on anything and everything
electronics,,4.0,Got TCX905 instead,"The TCX805 model was discontinued, and I ended up getting the 905 instead.  The keypad navigation has changed, so it'll take some getting used to, but it's now more similar to most cell phone navigation keypads which makes it easier to use.  It has a green ""Talk"" button on the left and a red ""End"" botton on the right as well as a up-down-left-right navigational pad in the middle"
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Cleaner,"This is an excellent product for cleaning all LCD screens, even for your HDTV...."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Easy to install and good reception,"Received the card a few days after I ordered it from Amazon.  After reading many reviews, I downloaded the driver from the Trendnet website instead of using the CD that came with the card.  Unzipped and installed the files, re-started my laptop and inserted the card.  Everything went smoothly and I was surfing the web in 5 mins.  I read Gary's review about the card not working for his IBM Thinkpad and was skeptical at first since I am also using an IBM Thinkpad running Windows98 SE.  But mine works perfectly and very good reception.  Highly recommend it"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Closed Tape Decks,"My Mercedes has a tape deck that requires the door to be shut to function.  I was worried when ordering this product that I wouldn't be able to shut the tape deck door, but got it anyway since it was the best solution at the time, allowing me to use my car's steering wheel controls to seek through songs.  Although the wire from the cassette to the iPod was too thick to shut, I was able to strip the wire coating way down (and eventualloy all the way off) and shut the tape deck.  It still works to this date.  Although I would NOT recommend doing this to yours, as it might impair the functionability of the SmartDeck, it did work for me.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A wonderful home printer,"This printer is great and does everything I would expect it to do for the price.  Nothing too fancy here - no faxing capabilities, no color printing.  But if you want a printer so that you can work from home, print out school papers, print out directions, etc. this is the one for you.  The quality is excellent!"
electronics,,5.0,awesome backpack,i got this backpackgoing in to college and use it everyday  and it holds my laptop and all the cords and all my books. its very nice and very durable. i am very happy with i
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Great for Running,"These headphones are well thought out and are the best I've found for running.  The behind the neck design allows you to wear a hat while you run and the single cord seems custom designed for runners - especially if you run with your MP3 player attached to your waistband.  The cord has a short straight section near the pin, then a clip, and then a long coiled section.  The result is that you can run the uncoiled section from your MP3 player around your back at the waist then clip it there.  This allows the coiled section to be positioned securely directly below the headphone it is attached to"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Youch!  I Must Have Big Ears,"Actually, I had never given any thought at all to the size of my ears -- until, that is, I got these headphones.  And the big headache that goes along with them when I use them."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Carefull not to damage your hearing...,"I purchased this so I could watch movies on my laptop while traveling by plane. The device works well and allows up to three users to plug in. However, be carefull when flying. Because the engines of the plane are so loud, I was forced to turn the volume all the way up to hear the movie. When I took off my headphones, I noticed that I had to strain to hear people talking. "
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,black cd r is a black hole,Would give it 0 stars if that were an option! It does not record in multiple recorders. A waste of time and money
electronics,9 of 11,4.0,Do not install netgear wireless admin GUI,The sofware ship with this adapter crashes in XP and  you will see a blue screen for every ten minutes. I spent couple of days to try different combinations. Finally I found a right combination. Here it is. Install only their drivers using Microsoft Hardward installation wizard and  use XP Wireless Configuration console rather than Netgear configuration utility. 
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great headphones for transcriptionists!,"As a work-at-home transcriptionist I needed some headphones that would block as much external noise as possible, and these headphones get the job done pefectly.  With these headphones on (using the black foam eartips) I can't hear the space heater running behind me, nor can I even hear the sound of my own typing, which I hadn't even realized was interferring with me hearing the audio before.  The only drawback I've found so far is that the disposable foam eartips are a little pricey, and because I use them so often I go through them very quickly.  The more I use them, the more wax builds up on them (I know, gross) and the seal they make in my ear gets less tight.  I've tried cleaning the foam eartips with earwax removal stuff from the drug store, but it didn't seem to do much.  So I've had to resign myself to buying lots of replacement foam eartips."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Don't buy it,"Don't buy this unit. The database is terrible, and Lowrance wants $75 for an update. This unit has sent me on wild goose chases looking for stores that moved from the database's given address years ago. It has no listing for businesses that have existed for years, and more often than not tells you to turn after you already passed the street it wanted you to turn on. Extremely disappointing, and definitely not worth the money"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,This product sucks,"It could have been good, but there's hissing and reception problems.  My wife has an IPOD and here wireless transmitter doesn't have this problem.  Don't buy - you'll be sorry"
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,Never worked,It gave me format errors out of the box..  I returned it to Tiger Direct for an exchange and got a refund instead. Not to happy about paying all the shipping costs for nothing
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,the product,It not bad for a cheap sound card it is good for minor things vouice chat listen to music and movies really basic installing it easy to install its software is not bad I was impress it was clear & sharp for being a off brand sound card.It offers good sound for a decent price wlel worth buying if you dont want to spend alot but have a good sound card for doing basic things easy to install and work so its well worth buying & using in your pc the fact my pc detected it with xp and there were no promblems is impressive not many are able to work on first installing with xp well worth buying and ownin
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,Great Switch - Stellar Value,"I've got two of these on my home network, serving a couple of Gigabit Ethernet based Macs, a TiVO and a host of audio and video gear and they've always performed perfectly. Great design, great value and excellent performance."
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,Perfect!,"This DVD player is all I need. The picture is great, the price is great and the operation is simple. I had read many good reviews of this product and I'm very pleased I chose it over more expensive models"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great Camera,This camera works perfectly for windows xp as well as Windows XP x64 and has some nice software included.  Also the image quality is great and setup is very simple
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good Alternative to the Bean Bag,"I like the suction cup mounted to the side window so the GPS screen is right above my field of vision to the side view mirror. Even though I need an accessory extension cord to drape the power cable over the steering column, I like not having the dash cluttered and my view of the road obstructed."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Speaker is fabulous, not like other models","Everything works fine, including the speaker.  I can stand 5 feet away and still hear and speak clearly.  So far, so good"
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,This stuff is Useless,I bought this from Amazon.com and it would not work on my PC which runs XP. I tried to get help from the email address but no reply. This is a complete waste of money and the guys who make it don't car
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Essential accessories ,I highly recommend this package if you are using the Garmin 60Cx for automotive navigation. The dash mount is rock solid on paved roads. I experienced some instabilty on hilly dirt roads which was to be expected especially with the type of dashboard that was on my rental car
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,"Good and strong, but no noticeable difference in sound","I used this Monster cable to replace an ordinary speaker cable that came with my Onkyo speaker system, mainly because I needed a longer cable. My ordinary human ears could not notice any difference in sound before and after. But the cable is strong and well shielded which made it more reliable when I had to pull it around the attic, down the wall gap and through rough holes. And, the price (despite all the hype) wasn't much more than what I was expecting to pay."
electronics,,5.0,The amazing motivator!,"The Nike+ system has really been a good motivator for me. As a new runner, I need all the motivation and positive reinforcement I can get. The challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well."
electronics,0 of 3,5.0,Awesome!!!!,"This card is simply awesome, I'm using it on my SE p990 and it works perfect (i got this card becuase I needed a lot of space because I have LOST episodes on my phone)."
electronics,,2.0,It was great when it worked... only 3 months,"I was really happy with the performance of my 4 GB unit, with or without the u3, you can get used to it and actually find a use, it's a good idea that needs just a few tweaks."
electronics,,4.0,Good Product,"I enjoy the convenience of this mouse and its accuracy. It seems to hold its charge which is great because I quite often forget to put it back in its cradle. It has lots of features but I haven't had the time or inclination to program all of them, however, I think it is a good product with a reasonable price"
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,great hardware - lame software,"This product looks ok, but it comes from the company configured as 2 drives, and when you connect, it forces the host computer to install some bull**** disk management software in order to recognize the part you can put files on."
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,What you expect from Monster Cable,Delivers crisp and clear audio without distortion. Optical is significantly better than the standard RCA connection. Great quality for a cheap price. A must have if you're into quality audio listening
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Good Choice,"This product functions as it should. This is a fine choice for an inexpensive product. There are more expensive card readers avalible, but I know of no advantage they may have over this one"
electronics,47 of 53,2.0,"Fun Radio, But Not For Your Emergency Kit","The Grundig FR200 (available in a rainbow of colors) is touted as THE emergency radio, primarily due to it's hand-crank power system.  Never need batteries, always ready to play when you most need it. Put it in your emergency kit, and you'll be informed and entertained no matter what happens.  (You DO have an emergency kit, right?).  Also has a built-in flashlight, so you can read the labels on those stored cans of chili.  "
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Excellent Value -- Wide range of functionality,"This DVD player is a great, mid-range player that encompasses a wide variety of disc formats. One of the best features is that it can store the exact position of playback for 5 discs so that if you stop watching one movie and move on to another, you can go back the next day and pick right up where you left off."
electronics,0 of 3,1.0,Didn't work for me,"I followed all the directions but could not get this modem to work in my IBM Thinkpad running Windows 98SE. I even went to the company's website and downloaded the latest driver updates but this didn't solve the problem. I contacted the company's technical support and they offered very little help but did offer to replace the unit. I didn't figure the new unit would be any better than the current one, so I decided to return it to Amazon for a full refund. Amazon even paid for the return shipping which is more than what the manufacturer offered!!!!"
electronics,26 of 30,4.0,"Great Sound, Good Video, Still Has Hard Drive Crash Issues","I first saw the Apple 80 GB iPod Video at a friend's house, and I knew that the only thing standing in the way of getting one of these fine new mp3 players was my wife's permission. One day, she told me that she could use an mp3 player to store all of her worship today praise choir songs. I knew that this was the appointed time, so I offered to give her my iPod if I could have permission to get this new one as an early Christmas present. "
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Great Product,It works perfectly.
electronics,,5.0,Great Product,I have been using this product for just 4 days so far its been such a delight to use it. The sound is so crisp and clear i just cannot beleave it. I previously used coby but it was of no good use after about 20min of use it used to show me error and was ejected out of the player but not with this sony product
electronics,4 of 7,1.0,These cost $10.00 with shipping!,"No kidding!!  The shipping charge on these batteries was over $6.00.  Amazon doesn't itemize the shipping charges on your order, so if you order multiple items, you won't know that you're being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late!"
electronics,,5.0,what an amazing deal,for this price and sound quality you cant beat it... maches my macbook perfectl
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Gets out of the way and lets me take pictures.,"Like any good piece of technology, this card stays out of the way, operating fast (I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT), trouble-free (so far), and behind the scenes. I bought this model because it was the best price per storage space solution for the format at the time. I'm sure that very soon, that magical price point will shift to 4 GB or higher"
electronics,,5.0,Airline flight savior,Did not feel like watching movies and the music on the flight was not that great. The battery pack allowed me to use my Ipod on the 9 hr flight to Europe and the 10 hr return. Best buy I made for the trip
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Very useful.,I strongly recommend this carrying case to anyone with a TalkAbout.  
electronics,,5.0,zen 4 gb flash player,This litle guy does everything he's supposed to. I used it to copy old recordings from a portable cassette player. It froze on me just once (during recording) but I just let the battery run down and it restarted promptly. Since I use it for daily biking I also bought an accessory case and a handlebar mounted speaker called Activetunes ($30 thru amazon). The entire setup is incredible and allows me to safely listen to my own music on city streets.
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Memory,"I did find the memory to be a bit hard to program but kept at it and suceeded, following the directions closely and being extra quick between the last two steps, prog/mute and hang up.  That allowed me to program long distance and local numbers"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Tom the Beach Man,This item was needed for use with the Garmin i5 GPS unit.    Fits well on the dashboard on my 06 Civic. In California it is illegal to suck the GPS to the windshield
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great phones for the price,"I don't know beans about earphone dynamics, range, acoustics, or anything else.   All I know is that these phones blew me away when I put them on.   I have had dozens of others before, none expensive to be honest, but nowhere near the quality of the HD212.   One other important point, I have dropped them, stepped on the cord so hard it rattled my head and yet they keep on trucking.   Very well built.  If you just want a great set of phones for your everyday tunes - this is it!!!!"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Not Worth It,"I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability.  It's going back in the morning."
electronics,2 of 12,2.0,Complete rip off,"The Garmin GPSMAP76Cx is very disappointing. Garmin recommended this unit after I contacted them about wanting a GPS I could transfer from my boat to my car and vice versa. It was more money than I had expected to pay but then it looked like it had everything I needed and although I knew I would have to buy a Bluechart map I was assured these were readily available on micro SD card. I was assured that the included Metroguide Europe software had detailed maps of the UK and therefore I would not need to purchase additional maps for using in the car. However when the unit arrived it became clear that the Metroguide Europe software does not do ""auto-routing"" (you can't get the GPS to find places and direct you to them) unless you have first worked out all your routes on a PC and uploaded them to the 76CX unit. If you want the 76CX to behave like a proper automotive GPS unit you have to purchase the City Navigator software which is another ?150! This seems completely crazy as dedicated car sat nav units are available for this price with auto-routing and all the bells and whistles as standard. The fact that Garmin didn't include the City Navigator software rather than the completely useless Metroguide software seems very mean spirited to me. At this point I was starting to feel a bit ripped off so I thought I would just buy the Bluechart Micro SD card and use the 76CX on the boat, and probably buy a proper dedicated road GPS separately. However when I tried to buy the Bluechart map on Micro SD card I couldn't find anyone in the UK who had them in stock. Garmin will only sell them directly within the US and eventually when I found someone who said they could order the card for me they said it would be ""at least 10 days"" to get it to them and it would cost 50% more than Garmin charge their US customers! After contacting Garmin's support team I was told to buy a blank SD card and the Bluechart map on CD - even more expensive! The Bluechart maps are also for quite large areas which is useless for me as I only have a small boat with a 10 mile range so really wont need such a large area but still you have no option to just buy the bit you need - you have to purchase an entire section! All in all this unit is fine - the screen is smaller than I would have liked and there's no voice directions, it also feels a lot flimsier than I thought it would, but the additional costs of maps and poor availability of pre programmed micro SD cards mean this is incredibly poor value for money - I really regret buying it now and wish I had done more research."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,i didnt even get to use it,its a cheap knockoff
electronics,,5.0,Works fine-  give it a shot.,"This charger seems well-built , and snugly fits my ipod's dock port.  And it charges the ipod.  What else is there? Shipping was quick, and I suppose the profit is made in the ""shiping and handling"" charge (still cheaper than anything else, though)"
electronics,29 of 32,5.0,Great Quality just Way Overpriced!!,"These and all other brand cables from MC are all overpriced including these.  I have a 20"" JVC I'Art television and I have my DVD connected through component.  I have used Monster Cable component cables and they put out pretty much the exact same picture as my newer PHILIPS brand component cables that I only had to pay about [$$$] or so for.  The PHILIPS are also shielded and gold plated and all that good stuff. So buy these MC component cables if you dont care about price, but otherwise buy PHILIPS brand that are way cheaper and put out the same quality picture"
electronics,,5.0,3 stacked and working fine for years,"I've been running 2 of these drives (250MB) for about 2 years, and a 3rd one (160MB) for over 4 years.  With no problems.  I leave one of the 250MB drives on all the time, as my primary file storage drive - used for file sharing on the home network, including the TiVo HD.  It works great.  The other 2 drives are left off most of the time, but I turn them on about once a week to make backups.  I'm running Windows XP, and there was no configuration or installation required.  These are solid machines; reliable, fast, and inexpensive.  "
electronics,10 of 10,1.0,A hobby not a calculator,"For perspective, I am am a lifelong HP user; I got the original hp-35  (in 1975 or so) and have had a 45, a 65, an 85 a 28s and most recently a 48G. I am an engineer and a computer nerd. Now for the review: GHASTLY!!  Whoever did the user interface and keyboard needs electroshock therapy.  I never liked the cluttered keyboard on the 48g and hoped they had improved it.  They did CHANGE it but the 49 is a huge step in the wrong direction. The keybord is non-intuative with many similar and redunant markings (eg the 3 different kinds of parentheses, all blue, or how about two functions called rnd(z) and rand(z)? One is Random number, the other is round) The equation writer is useless because you have to dig thru mutiple levels of menus to get the labels.  Finally the thing is made like a toy..painted on keys instead of embossed, cheesey tin faceplate and a manual so filled with errors and prattle that no one will read it.  The actual users manual is only on CD and is (READY?) 840 pages!!!  That babe that took over HP left the company in a real mess"
electronics,,5.0,Satisfied with purchase,I use this in my business office.  The headset is comfortable; I forget it's on.  The keypad module is so small that it rides in my shirt pocket without falling out when I bend over.  Usually.  I am a little hard of hearing but the volume is more than adequate.  Sound is good.  Microwave oven disrupts at a considerable distance. Buttons are tiny but I don't care. I quit using my other phone. I need to figure out how to store frequently-called numbers. The only thing I miss from my old main phone is its 100-number memory. Its drawbacks are small price to pay for the freedom. I also considered the CS-351
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,exceed  expectations,"best performance, have a lot of futures, from different rings to room monitor, diect link like walkie talkie and multi connection of multiple handset.I bought the set of 2 handset with the base, for 63.00 free shipping a deal. I am very satisfied, and I do raccommend it, Uniden is the best.From 2.4 Ghz to 5.8 Ghz there a big difference, especially if you have a wireless network"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,lots of fun,We got this chopper for our 5 year old on his birthday. He was alittle small for it at first. The chopper went so fast because of his size however after a few months he can really control it now. He loves it. We have had no problems so far. Adults can ride this chopper also. My father inlaw came to visit and had so much fun on it. We think if your interested in this at all you should get it. You wouldn't regret it
electronics,12 of 14,4.0,GREY CREATURES = UGLY!!!,"First off, let me say how much I love the sound of these incredible speakers. I completely reccomend buying them. However..."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"Superior Value, B+ Performance","Compact,light-weight and multi-featured...and all for $40! Pleasing audio, excellent AM/FM reception, very good frequency stability and very good image rejection add to its versatility. The inclusion of a fine-tuning knob is critical for shortwave and ""DX"" AM reception and, with the addition of a long wire clipped to the telescopic antenna, the radio really can pull in some of the weaker stations. A couple of minutes worth of cranking powers the radio from 2-4 hours, and 3 AA batteries last a LONG time. Another plus is a carrying case (with an adjustable strap)with a pocket to stash papers or notes in. This is a perfect emergency, hunting, camping or hanging out in the backyard radio. The only feature lacking is a lighted tuning dial but, if you reflect (or deflect) the light from the radio's built-in front panel flashlight onto the tuning dial, voila! All in all, a tremendous value in an emergency radio. "
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,BEST SO FAR,"I wish I been found this, i have spent money on various fm transmitters & this is the best.I love the fact that you can also recharge your ipod while listening to it in the ca"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Performs spectacularly,"One of the few RCA adaptors I found that uses the dock plug instead of the headphone plug. I believe this removes the volume restriction and so forth, and makes a cleaner output requiring you to jack up the volume less."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,My inexpensive solution...,"...was to mount the wheel onto a full size ironing board of all things!  It's height adjustable and relatively stable.  Plus, positioning the crossing support bars slightly to the right allows the pedals to be placed under your right foot while still leaving enough room for your right leg."
electronics,,1.0,No good,This inflator would not inflate my car tire AT ALL.  The gauge stayed at 90 psi.  I returned it to the local Sharper Image store but only got store credit.  Customer Service adjusted the credit to my charge account.  I do not recommend this inflator but Sharper Image is a reputable company. I would not hesitate buying from them
electronics,14 of 15,2.0,Street Atlas 2005 HH provides wrong route and hard to use,I bought the blue logger and both Street atlas 2005 and SA2005 HH for my Dell X50V. No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows: 
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,great card good price,"After having great experience with the 1GB extreme III card, I ordered the 2GB just before I went on a short vacation. I love the speed of the extreme III cards - writing to the card I can actually exceed the camera's stated continuous frame (manual says about 9, but I've gotten over 20 in a row with before a delay) and reading the large amount of data off the card is similarly speedy when using a good usb 2.0 card reader. Sandisk just released the extreme IV cards, but for the price difference I think this card is a better deal"
electronics,,5.0,Excellent value,I've used Sony earbuds for several years and have always been happy with them.  I've had a pair of MDR-E829V earbuds for a few weeks and use them every day.  They were very inexpensive and sound great!
electronics,,5.0,Hands down the best mouse you can get for your laptop,"This is a very high quality mouse and it's extremely portable.  I've had this mouse for over two years without any problems.  It's extremely accurate b/c of it's optical light, but it's main strong point is the fact that you can wrap the cord around the mouse for storage.  Definitely one of the best investments I made for my Sony VAIO"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect,"I gave as a gift to my brother, and he has never stop thanking me. I guess that is because it is really good. Delivered faster than expect. No complains at all"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,WOW,"After reading a bunch of reviews and looking at a bunch of pictures, the first thing that amazed me was how tiny this thing actually was. Pictures do not do it justice. Fits in the palm of your hand. "
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,the best ink cartridges,I can always depend on Amazon.com to thave the best ink cartridges for my printer. The prices are always lower than anywhere else. The service is always outstanding
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Excellent value for money,"The Geko 201 is a great GPS. I've had it for almost a year and never had any complaints. Sure, it doesn't come with mapping features, altimeter, etc. But if you are only going to use it for light hiking and geocaching, this is the best in the market. It's lightweight and compact and can take quite a few knocks! I've dropped it on rocks and into the water a few times and it still managed to survive with just a few scratches. Like other GPS units, it doesn't work very well if you are walking in an area closed in by trees or buildings."
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,"Cheap, compact and fast!","This little hub is just about everything you could want it to be. It's extremely compact, I don't think it's physically possible to have a smaller 4 port USB hub. At the same time it's also very solid and feels durable. The hub provides plenty of power and charges my ipod. A handy LED light turns on when the hub is plugged into your computer. I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but my ipod updates at the same song-a-second rate as it normally does when connected directly. I suppose that the hub does impose a certain bandwidth limit, so that you cannot have 4 devices transferring at the full USB 2.0 transfer rate at once, but that's to be expected. This would be excellent for any laptop user with a dearth of ports, or someone who just happens to need to connect a few more devices to their already maxed out system"
electronics,,5.0,Tons of storage with this media card!!,"This is a super media card, perfect for storing and transfering lots of extra pictures"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Took a chance - glad I did!,"I print mostly on 3-hole punched, multi-use 20# paper.  After owning this printer a few months and printing about 20,000 pages, I can report complete satisfaction.  Three times a page has tracked crooked, but not jammed.  Twice it has told me there was a paper jam when there was none (I opened and closed the back door and it started back up).  These were trivial issues. I stepped over the line and tried printing on some 26# (maybe heavier) bulk paper (origin unknown).  The first page was fine, but following pages were badly wrinkled. The 20# paper does have a slight curve after printing, but this is not an issue to me.  The family history books I print flatten the pages out nicely.  Legal size multi-use paper prints great - both sides.  Print quality is excellent, fast, and economical. "
electronics,,5.0,Blown me away!,"This system can blow you away...if you don't hold on to your chair. If you one of the people like solid heart pounding music...well this is it, Logitech 2.1 THX speaker system...get it now...you won't be disappointed"
electronics,,5.0,Works like a Charm..  ,"I bought a new HDTV and was considering switching to Cable to get the HD transmission. But a lot of the channels offered on HD,by Cable and Satellite are seldom viewed by me. So I wanted to give this a shot. THis works like a charm. I could get HD transmission of all local channels without a problem. I have tall trees around my house( I am not located in a metro area with a lot of buildings).I could even hide the antenna behind the TV and get crystal clear HD transmission of CBS, NBC, ABC and NBC plus some other channels. I am not switching to Cable until they give a lot more channels on HD at a more reasonable price. "
electronics,,4.0,Solid Mouse (4 1/2 Stars),"Perfect for every day use! I use it with my home/school laptop and I have had no problems with it. It connects write out of the box to my built in bluetooth (make sure to finalize everything in your bluetooth manager). This version does NOT come with a usb reciever, which may be bad news for others but it was just what I was looking for since I had bluetooth right off-the-bat. Great design: looks great, its comfortable (feels better in your hand more so than ANY other mouse I have used), has the right amount of weight to it, very responsive, and excellent battery life (haven't changed them yet and I leave it on all the time). It even comes with an awesome little neoprene case which is very nice for taken back and forth between home and school. The scroll wheel isn't 360, but come on, how many times do you actually need that on a widescreen display. The only thing that keeps this mouse being perfect is its buttons fell a little cheap next to the rest of the mouse's design. Sure they click fine, but they are a little noisy and don't feel as solid as the rest of the package. Really this is not a big problem in terms of functionality, just a dissapointment in missed details. I actually think this should be a 4 1/2 star rating. Logitech hasn't let me down yet, they make great i/o devices, and if your looking for a great bluetooth mouse, look no further"
electronics,6 of 8,1.0,Bad Bad products,"It suddenly stoped working after two months. The tech support is even worse, alway tried to let me believe the problem is from router. Don't trust D-link"
electronics,,4.0,Decent Pad,Shaped basically like a PS2 controller.  Has a little bit of weight to it unlike other PC controllers that feel like if you dropped them they would bust open
electronics,7 of 10,2.0,"Okay,  but bundled software fails to impress   ","Right now you can find terrific values in flash drives, and can pretty much name your price. So what clearly differentiates different makes and models is the hardiness, speed/efficiency, and longevity of each - on the first two scores this unit is so-far-so-good, and on three, we shall see - as well as the intuitiveness and ease of its operation. "
electronics,11 of 13,1.0,technical support?,"When plugged into the USB port, this product was recognized by both our Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 XP computers, but did little else.  (The 98 machine routinely froze when trying to access it and the XP machine gave an error upon any attempt to move or create files/folders to the drive.)  Three different Macintoshes failed to recognize the drive.  The packaging did not include a technical support number.  The PNY website did not provide an obvious technical suport number, and none of the FAQs were relevant to our problem.  I sent an email through the PNY website which took two weekdays to obtain any sort of reply or confirmation.  Finally, when provided a number, I was not able to navigate the long option menu and talk to a live person without giving up and picking an inappropriate option.  "

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,I can't remember life without it- nor do I want to!,I LOVE my Garmin. My running has vastly improved and helped me meet and beat my running goals. 
electronics,80 of 96,5.0,How many pictures will it store?,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,what's not to like?,"Perfectly fine phone & clock radio.  Integrated with Panasonic base phone it has caller ID, different ring tones & great coverage.  The clock/radio is great"
electronics,,4.0,Im716,"Great sound quality, although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt. I recommend keeping the setting on ""Bass"" because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak. Prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear. The case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of effort/time it takes to get them properly in there. Other than those minor issues, its great...I prefer these over any sony/ipod/or creative earbuds."
electronics,,5.0,These are impressive,I give these five stars instead of 4 because for the price its an exceptional deal. Like others have stated the wire connections are fragile and you will have to be careful. 
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Beautiful, but...","This speaker system is truly great looking--even down to the blue light that emanates from it at night. But to my wife's and my ears, the midrange just doesn't compete with my incredible bargain Creative Labs T3000 (roughly $40 and often cheaper with rebates). Still, if you've got an iBook or iMac and care about the visuals, or if you use speakers for gaming and don't care about the timbre of vocal harmonies so much, the Creature is still very good and you can't top the look"
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Worked while it worked.,"I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago.  I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all.  I had it for 15 months"
electronics,6 of 8,5.0,Works wonderfully for me,"Luckily for me I didn't read the negative reviews here before I purchased, or I wouldn't have the really nice 4850 scanner. Maybe I'm just lucky, but everything about this scanner has worked very well and the scans are great. The software installed without any problems, the pushbutton controls work great and the scans are fast. I would like to note that I have a computer with an AMD 3200+ CPU with 1.5 gigs of ram and lots of hard drive storage and it's set up for video (home movie to DVD) and general business use. That may be a factor in having no problems with this scanner and having only good things to say about it. "
electronics,,5.0,viking usb 512mb,"nice simple design, easy to use, worked great for me so far"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Batteries are supposed to be standardized,I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Deal,"Hardware was A breeze to install.took about 20 minuets including the bay.Same for the software, no problems.Sound Quality is much improved over my old live card.In battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 2.4/radeon 9700 pro/512.Before I would freeze framing during start in rooms, and during game play in intense situations.Now with the X-Fi I have none of that, and the game runs much smoother overall. Dvd movies sound much improved. Music is also much improved. The only problem Ive  had burning expanded mp3's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far. Software interface is also A bit lack luster, but is functional. Card is worth the price, hopefully upgrades will improve interface. "
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,This phone system works for me!!!,"After purchasing this particular phone system and using it for several months now, I feel that I made the appropriate purchase.  Great quality for the money"

electronics,7 of 7,1.0,Garmin C330 adapter 010-10085-00 cigarette lighter,I have no idea why Amazon recommends this for the C330 GPS as it doesn't fit that model. I ordered it on Amazons recommendation and decided it is too much trouble to send it back. They need to check out what works with what. Be careful what they add as accessories as they may not work with the model you order
electronics,,5.0,Feels good and works good!,"Best mouse I have ever used.  The feel is nice and the method of recharging the flat battery is really clever, so you are never left without a charged battery for the mouse.  One battery is always charging in the receiving unit...so when your mouse battery runs out you have a fully charged one ready to go."
electronics,19 of 24,5.0,Power UPS! Everything you need to know.,"First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin"

electronics,13 of 14,5.0,Excellent Player,"First of all, I'm not computer savy, I'm over 54 years of age, and this is my first MP3 player. It is a beautiful player that is very easy to use. I had no problem loading the software on my computer. Music and pictures downloaded with ease. The clarity and vibrant colors on the screen are exceptional. The radio works well as does the built in microphone. I loaded videos last night with out a hitch. It's great to drop and click and the software did a format conversion to the videos before loading and all was well. The player is fairly simple to navigate and it's fun to try out all the options. The player takes pitures from a compact flash card very easily and efficiently. For being a non-computer geek, this player is the best and is just a joy to operate. The ear buds aren't the most comfortable so you might want to change these out.    "

electronics,10 of 11,5.0,Solved my problems,"Previously Adelphia had setup my cable using two daisy chained 2 way splitters.  This caused my HD signals to drop very frequently, especially on HBO.  It was so bad that I couldn't watch the HD feed at all.  I was told that this would not solve my problem from a local high end A/V store, but they were dead wrong.  Once I replaced the 2 splitters with 1 4-way splitter my signal was perfect.  In fact, the reception on the analog stations also improved dramatically.  To ensure the best signal I have also added other hardware: 1 Motorola Drop amp, 1 Monster 4 way loss loss splitter, then a Monster PowerCenter HTS 2100 with video filtering"

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Garmin IQue 3600: Great product,"The product was received in a timely fashion and was exactly as advertised.  Hardware is top quality.  Software is equally so.  Only quality which prevented me from assigning the fifth star was the lack of display screen brightness to be seen easily while sitting on the dashboard of a vehicle with a large windshield.  Otherwise the unit met my every expectation.  PDA software is better than average but the crowning glory of the unit is the quality of the mapping system.  It is outstanding in every respect.  Not sure how much map data can be loaded into the internal memory but the entire U.S. can be loaded onto a 2.0GB Secure Digital external memory card loaded into the slot on top of the unit.  GPS and the navigation voice commands are OUTSTANDING!!!  Battery life is more than adequate, provided the brightness level is lowered significantly.  When in a cradle (auto or desktop) I run at full brightness."

There is a USB cord from the unit to the IPOD, but that is it. A little more expensive, since it has an Apple logo associated with it, but it works"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Worked for me,"I'd read the reviews and debated about buying this. I work in IT so my working knowledge of computers is pretty good. Lots of people complain about DLink but I've worked with products from all the major brands - Netgear, Linksys, DLink, Cisco, Hawking, Belkin - and have had both good and bad experiences with all of them. So despite the poor reviews and because it was on sale I figured it was worth a shot. "
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Great Bang for the Buck!,"I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service."

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Great for their intended use(s) & bargain-priced!,"While there are unquestionably better-sounding headphones available, you'd be very challenged to find something better-sounding at this price point. Other pluses include deep, powerful bass response without being ""boomy,"" the closed-back earcups provide excellent isolation & makes the HD205 a good choice for use in noisy environments or when others around you might be disturbed when you crank the volume, & the 32-ohm, highly efficient drivers make this a good match for iPods & other portable music players - lets you play 'em loud, while still being gentle on the battery! I have a moderately large head (Size 7 1/2) so I initially found them too tight, as some other reviewers have mentioned. Sennheiser tech support suggested gently stretching the headband by placing them over something slightly larger than my head (sofa arm, computer tower, etc.) and leaving overnight. That did the trick for me, although I needed to repeat the procedure once more, about a week later"

It was stored in 1 place the entire time, never moved, never dropped, never abused. And it dies. I then attempt to take advantage of the Visa ""double your warranty"" extended warranty coverage, only to be told that because I used my online ""Amazon' gift certificate to pay for a portion of this product, that this excludes the extended warranty. So I toss out a brand new looking Sony product. "

electronics,9 of 9,4.0,Great Buy,"I bought these headphones a couple months ago to use with my mp3 player, and I've been very pleased. I wanted to buy a good pair of headphones and not spend a ton of money. I've used lots of Sennheiser equipment in the past, and I've always liked their products. The sound quality is very good, the only downside is that the mp3 player I have isn't great, so the sound could be better, but it has nothing to do with the headphones. If you're an average music fan and don't need the greatest pair of headphones ever invented, you'll be pleased with these. I was a DJ at a radio station for a while so I know what good sound is and what good equipment is, and these headphones are pretty good. Again though, if you're really looking for something with vastly superior sound quality, spend more money on a higher end product. Sennheiser makes nice stuff."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,"Great idea, if only it worked. Think twice!","Set up was easy, technical support was readily availible. However the camera over a short amount of time stopped working. Had to reset the camera several times a day for it to work. We bought it for remote security for a restaurant, so needless to say it failed for our application. Called TS about a dozen times until ""THEY"" determined the unit faulty. Returned the unit for one that was even worse. Now I'm getting the run around with the RMA department. I'm going to buy a different camera now at a local retailer. This way, I can return it without issue if there is any problems."
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"Fabulous phone, superb design.","Previous reviewer was right! This phone is attractively designed and works great with many features. It's the ideal home office phone. It's rare when you plug in a device for the first time that you get a feeling that a lot of thought and effort went into design. When I plugged in this phone I got that feeling when the brief test mode lit up the orange and green lights on the buttons- very nice designed lights! So far using this phone, I have no complaints, just a very minor gripe- if you talk too close to the mic in the handset it causes an annoying static type sound in the earpiece (wind blast noise). This is easily avoidable by talking at least 1 inch from the mic. Still, maybe noise reduction might have prevented this, not sure. Except for that minor quibble this phone is a masterwork of design and function."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Very comfortable and a good buy.,"First off, I LOVE my new Shure E3c phones! I can really hear the music and none of the annoying chatter when I'm flying anywhere. The ear foams were my best choice as I have small canals. A 20-piece set of spares is a good buy, as your originals will eventually get too dirty"
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Nice sound and big from a small package,"So I bought these speakers for work.  I work in a restaurant.  They are used with an MP3 (gigabeat S) player not a computer.  They work great.  They come with a small cable (as well as a pc audio cable) and can plug right in front of the unit.  They are small and fit right on a shelf next to napkins.  I now come to work early, crank tunes and get things done early."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Great Speakers But . . . .,"I have had this set for about a year.  Originally I rarely played music on my PC, but with the additon of a newer computer, DVD burner, Flat 19"" screen, I've put my entire (and it's no small amount) music collection on my PC. I now almost exclusively use my PC as my sound system.  That having been said, these speakers are just not quite capable of replaceing a house system.  The sound quality is great and if you only intend to listen to music while you're sitting near the computer (as in the same room) and you don't plan on pumping it up, then these will serve you well.  However, if you want to feel the bass rumbling through your floor and walls and if you plan to drown out party-goers--look elsewhere.  These are great computer speakers that play music well. They're not music speakers that just happen to hook into a computer.  I wrote this review specifically to warn those who read all the other reviews about LOUD BASS.  It's just not loud, adequate loudness and suprising good quality for a decent price (I paid 30)"

electronics,15 of 15,4.0,Great gamepad...,"...for about 6 months. For anyone planning on using this controller infrequently, it's really not a bad purchase. But for folks looking to log a lot of hours on it, run away. The fundamental flaw in this controller is the poor quality of the rotating contacts used in the analog sticks (I've pulled apart a few failed ones for autopsies). The metal just simply disintegrates after enough use. The sticks lose their sensitivity, and the pad fails as mentioned in so many other reviews. What's worse is that the ones sold on retail shelves RIGHT NOW are identical to the very first Dual Actions released, and Logitech apparently has no intention of upgrading or fixing the design. Let this be a lesson to manufacturers: don't order 10 million units of a component regardless of how good a deal the supplier cuts you"
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,"Some startup problems, then works fine","I had some odd problems with this flash drive ont he first day that I used it. It didn't seem to reliably connect to my computers. Once when it did connect copying files was amazingly slow. After those first few bad experiences, it has worked fine ever since. Maybe the contacts needed to be worn down a little bit or something. Anyway, since then I have used the DataTraveler regularly (just about every day) to copy files between an HP laptop and two iMacs and it has worked without a hitch. One funny observation. They put an In Use light on one side of this drive. In about half the USB ports I have put it in, the light is facing away from the user. It would be nice if there were some universal standards for USB ports about which way is up, or in the case of vertically mounted ones, which way is facing the user. It would make them easier to plug in without looking inside the plug every time (for those of us who use multiple machines)"

Upgraded the firmware and software and then just put in the model numbers and it did the rest.  First push of a button and it worked exactly as it was supposed to.  Able to switch to DVD mode or Stereo with a push of a button.  No need to turn device off prior to.  Volume is adjusted from the remote.  Put the other remotes in the drawer and riding solo with this baby.  I no longer need to use 1 for the volume and another for everything else.  Yes, it does take a little to get used to where all of the buttons are, but it feels good in the hand.  i recommend this remote for anyone who truly wants remote for everything.  "
electronics,3 of 6,4.0,space saver..,bose 321 is a nice stuff and good for the room. the sound is clear and crisp. a lot better than a usual mini component. no need to set up an elaborate sound system because this will do the trick.handy and easy to use. good quality sound for such a small piece. thou a little expensive but no regrets because its a bose. im a satisfied customer. so far i dont have problems. please dont let me have one
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,What to Consider...,"When I buy flash memory, I consider price, speed, manufacturer and vendor. I got this particular memory stick for a SonyEricsson w810i phone. I paid extra to get it from Amazon (no they don't always have the best price). This way I am confident that I can return it if I got the wrong one or have a problem with it."
electronics,,5.0,Garmin iQue M5 Integrated Pocket PC and GPS - Awesome,"This is a great item.  I use it all the time - contacts, calendar etc. and it's also great to have a GPS too all on one hand held.  I have used the GPS system quite often and find it gets me to where I want to go. Very user friendly and easy to use"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Outstanding addition to my Bose Headphones,I use this devise to control the volume to my Bose Headphones.  Its only drawback is that I would like it to have a mute button
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Great Little Printer,"I have been very impressed by this printer for the price.  It zips through pages and looks  a lot better than the Brother and Samsung purchased by our office.  I am using it on Mac OS 10.4.7 & 10.3.9, but installations at the office in 2 Dell XP Pro PCs went without a hitch.  The noise level strikes me as pretty quiet, especially compared to the old HP LJs that I used to support. "

electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Terrible Static Noise,"I agree with Brooke Allen very much. This speaker is terrible. The noise due to alternate electric is very anoying. If you tune up volumn to max, you will find it is as loud as a hungry bee... I'm going to return it very soon"
electronics,16 of 16,5.0,"Works great, sounds great","I just bought a new 2006 Civic and like all new Hondas, it has a line input on the stereo. I have been using this Auto Kit for 2 months and I love it. It makes my 1 hour commute somthing I look forward to. When you hook up the ipod with the large connector on the bottom with the Auto Kit, the sound is so much more clear and free of distortion over using the headphone out. I have been a professional audio engineer for 25 years, so I know good sound. The review I read helped me choose, so I hope this will help someone else"
electronics,,5.0,Awesome Gadget,Never owned a webcam before. This was easy to install and use. Picture clarity is great. Microphone interface was clear. No distortion. Great value for the money
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Does what I wanted,"Does what it says. I like that it charges my ipod at the same time. I don't have lots of stations in my area so 87.9 worked great. No noise or static. I do wish it would cut the power to the ipod off when you turn off your car...but no big deal. Audio quality is decent, but not up to CD quality and volume level is a little low....but I am pleased until I can get a new stereo with line-in"
electronics,,2.0,Overpriced to FOOL anyone still thinking in ANALOG Terms,"You people are still thinking in analog terms!  The beauty of digital transmission of sound data is that the sound quality will not be partially degraded by cheap cables.  Either the data makes it through the cable PERFECTLY, or it doesn't get through at all.  Thus, data transmission failures will be very obvious (i.e. if your cable doesn't work you'll hear either no sound or sound that goes off and on like someone was flicking a switch); I assert that anyone who reports slight improvements after purchasing a $30 cable is fooling themselves to justify their consumer folly.  There is no reason to pay these exorbitant prices for digital cable!  Do what I do:  use some spare coaxial TV cable you have lying around (you'll need a screw on adapter at each end to convert the F-type TV connector to RCA-type connector, these cost about $2 each at your local hardware or radio-shack type outlet).  Remember, when working with a digital signal, either it gets through perfectly or not at all"
electronics,3 of 9,2.0,Don't waste your money,"When using this headset with my MP3 player it sounds OK (just OK) and has pretty good range......but that's not the main reason why I bought it. I needed a headset for my LG CG300 cell phone, and at more than $150 off retail I thought this would be a great bargain. "
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Don't Buy this Product,"I was at the golf show a few years ago when this first came out, and I thought, what a wonderful idea.  I was going to buy one, then I got a chance to play with a guy who had one, and I had my rangefinder.  The skycaddy, was always off 5-10 yards, didn't even lock in until the 5th hole, and was a complete waste of time.  My friend is so PO'd about it, he was a babbling idiot, he can't get hold of the service people, can't get it to operate, etc, etc....I hear that several pro shops around the country are dropping them, because their members are so upset after buying one from them...I just bought a new Nikon 500, and its a dream, small and extremely accurate....too bad skycaddy blew this product, I'm sure someone will come out with a better mouse trap, color, etc, but the reputation of gps because of skycaddy will hurt them"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Not bad but...,This is one of those mice that has awesome potential but it doesn't quite live up to it. Firstly the good points:
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Extremely Disappointed,"It appears these music CD-Rs do not work on most home CD players.  I can only get them to work in my computer and in my car CD player (and that doesn't play back as great a quality as I'd like).  I thought these would work since I had previously bought JVC Audio CD-Rs which are awesome.  I won't bother with these again and unfortunately, I bought two spindles"
electronics,13 of 15,5.0,"What can I say, it works?","An audio plug adaptor is made to do one thing, make connections between output and input possible. And this thing does so. Not much else to say, really"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Superb sound and fabulous design,"We got these speakers to project some decent sound from my laptop computer. My Toshiba P25 does have built-in harman/kardon speakers, but they aren't sufficient for a proper listening experience when viewing DVDs, playing CDs or streaming music from Rhapsody. The Creature speaker system is fantastic!"
electronics,,5.0,fantastic find,"I just bought the Logitech QuickCam, and am VERY happy with it.  Delivery was rapid, and after hooking it up, with minimal trouble, I've had hours of pleasure from it."
electronics,25 of 25,1.0,Good Price? Not really. Bad Seller? Definitely.,"Shipping is $7.99 and they don't combine items. That means that, if you buy two, your shipping will be $15.98... on two little tiny mini SD cards! I WAS going to buy four of them: $56 for the little things, $32 shipping! Lame"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,AKG K26Ps vs Sennheiser PX100s,"I am a musician that already owns high-end Sennheiser headphones for use in my studio. However, I needed some inexpensive headphones for use with my iPod. After much research I found the best reviews for the AKG K26Ps and the Sennheiser PX100s. I couldn't decide so I bought both knowing that my wife needed a new pair of headphones too. Using my iPod and listening to the same songs through both headphones I compared a variety of music styles. The PX100s are promoted as having ""natural sound"" and I would say that is exactly what they have. They have amazing clarity and you can hear every note. Despite sounding incredible, I did notice that the sound seemed a little ""distant"". They have an air to them that somewhat mimics surround sound and makes for a very pleasant listening experience. The earpieces have open backs so people sitting close by will probably be enjoying the same music. These headphones are incredibly light; the earpieces are very comfortable, and I could definitely see wearing these for hours at a time. The way that they fold up is ingenious but takes some practice and they come in a sturdy plastic case that protects the headphones and allows you to wind the cable up very neatly. The K26Ps are quite different. Like the PX100s they have surprising clarity for such inexpensive headphones. Every time I plugged them in after having listened through the PX100s and I had to turn the volume down quite a bit because they are so much louder. Where the PX100 present a distant sound, the acoustics of the K26Ps are up front and right at your ear. This is the sound that I prefer. At the right volume the K26P sound just blew me away. Being a musician I'm picky about being able to hear everything, and while both provide that, the K26Ps are my top choice for audio quality. The K26Ps are little heavier than the PX100s; the earpieces have a vinyl-like covering over the foam and, while comfortable, tend to push on the ears a little harder than the PX100s. One of the biggest complaints I read about the K26Ps is that the headband is quite tight and I have to agree. While I could imagine this getting tiring on my ears, I also don't plan to wear these for extended periods so for me it doesn't matter much. However, I also found the headband to be less comfortable. Where the PX100s have some nice covered foam the length of the headband that comes in contact with the top of your head, the K26Ps have no cover at all. In fact, the glide adapters that allow for the adjustment of the headbands actually annoy me a bit if I have them too tight on my head. The K26Ps also have a wonderful method for folding up but they come with a light material bag as their case and you just have to wind the chord around the phones. Not as graceful and well executed as the PX100s, but still convenient. They both provide a two year warranty. Despite the PX100s being more comfortable, the audio quality lead me to chose the K26Ps for my use and I gave the PX100s to my wife (which she actually like better any way). In my opinion you can't go wrong with either of them and I can't imagine there being better headphones available for the money."
electronics,12 of 12,5.0,My Fingers Just Love this Baby,"I have an iBook and after having gone through a keyboard at over a hundred bucks, I decided to buy an additional USB keyboard to use when I'm working at my desk. It saves wear and tear on the iBook, plus it puts the screen a little further away and that's good as it seems my eyes want reading glasses when the screan is in my face."
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,WAAS overhyped,"I have been using my 201 for several months.  Compared to the only other GPS I have used, a $10k Trimble, it is a bargain. "
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,t-shirt transfers,"I've used both H-P and Office Depot transfers, & been happy with both.  Both went on easily & did not peel off in washing, although there was some fading after a number of months.  This may have been  avoided with more careful laundering.  I liked the Office Depot somewhat better--but both were satisfactory.  I have to say that the Avery dark t-shirt transfers are ones I would never use again because not only did the black ink in my Epson printer bleed with the Avery transfers, but the two times I attempted to used them, my printer stopped printing in black and caused me no end of trouble.  I would be wary of the Avery.  I plan to stick to the two brands I've had luck with"

electronics,15 of 17,5.0,rock it.,"They're perfect for my dorm room, small, easy to use, fun colors, enough sound with me turning the knob up halfway, much more potential for loudness if I want it. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,worth it!,"For this price, how can you go wrong? They work, the sound is decent and they fold up perfectly. I am amazed! If you're looking for a way to listen to your ipod at work or in the kitchen, say... they're perfect."
electronics,,4.0,iPod car adapter,Works well enough. Top of line stereo on my truck so I can easily tell the difference in sound from a cd or xm to the ipod. But in most cases it stays clear and has no interference. I found that if I hang the cord over the rear view mirror (not sure if legal) it comes in excellent. Not many other options to place it. 
electronics,,4.0,viking digital card,this is a very good product. It stores several pictures and seems to work really well
electronics,11 of 11,2.0,The most confusing Alarm clock with the WORST sounds!,"I purchased this for my husband who likes to sleep with some sort of noise. I thought this might work. Well, the nature sounds are the WORST I have ever heard. The LCS is not that big or bright and the snooze button is very close to the OFF button which is not good. I guess for someone who really likes gadgets and studies their new electonic toys may like this clock, but personally I found it confusing. This is not a pull out of the box and use clock. I swear you couldn't figure out how to set the alarm without the manual. You have to push 3-4 buttons to accomplish it. What we wanted if for was useless and there was WAY too many stupid extras. We ended up selling ours at a yard sale"
electronics,,5.0,Good Product!,"The Garmin eTrex Vista Cx is quite an item!  I am not a technical type who has checked out the item in detail, but so far am impressed.  I did check out the product fairly thoroughly before buying (internet, other gps owners, a local store) - I recommend the color screen - images are much easier to see, worth the extra price.  I use mine mainly for hiking - was fun to watch it show the path I had taken (used it while doing a round of golf!) and it works well.  Reception was also better than I had expected - worked well in the car and near windows in the house.  It takes about a minute to locate satellites and get started after being turned off - sometimes a bit longer (50 seconds up to about 1 1/2 minutes under an open sky).  I use rechargeable batteries - get fairly good life from them - haven't timed them to see exactly how long they last.  Would recommend ones with replaceable AA batteries over ones that need to be recharged . . . not much fun to have batteries go dead and no outlet to charge up available.  I keep an extra set or two with the Garmin, just in case needed."
electronics,15 of 15,5.0,Outstanding photo quality,"I've had this printer over a month now.  I have a Fujifilm S602 digital camera.  The quality of the photos, whether 4x6 or 8.5x11, is excellent.  The definition and sharpness of color are fantastic.  The creativity potential is outstanding.  I'm thrilled with this purchase"
electronics,,5.0,Good quality,I bought this particular card for my Sony Handycam DCR-HC85 in case I ever wanted to snap photos with it.
electronics,,5.0,Great little printer,"Nice compact printer for one on the road. Optional battery lasts forever between charges. Actually, have only needed to charge it once in over a month now! Unlike the junk HP printers, this one works great. It is a little heavy with the battery attached but small enough to easily carry in laptop bag. This sharp looking printer won't let you down"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,No complaints at all. ,Easy to print good quality on. Super easy to iron on. The best I have tried and at a price not much more that the cheap junk.
electronics,,1.0,Not very compatible with Sony FS laptop,"I have used 6 DVD-R out of ten now. And 2 failed. I use Sony FS550. Maybe they are not very compatible, or I burned too much data on a single disc. (I usually burn 4450MB, close to the 4489 limit shown on Nero)"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Hoping for the best,"I am very leery about these flat screen monitors.  However, I am enjoying the Sony very much.  I bought a Pixo, and it blew out in only three months.  Someone told me to get a Sony.  They've had it six years, and nothing happened to it yet. So your reviews are very helpful to me.  Thanks guys"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Save your money,"When the printer works, it prints very nice pictures, quite sharp with amazing accurate colors and saturation.  However, it's an ink jet printer, with all the evils associated with ink jets.  Clogged nozzles, missing lines in the print, and a very small ink supply.  If you do frequent nozzle cleanings, you'll restore the print quality, but that is a waste of ink.  It has a couple improvements in that the ink ostensibly doesn't fade like normal ink does, and there are six jets, so color mixing is more accurate.  Furthermore, the prints are waterproof.  When printing through Epson's Film Factory, the printer crops the borders of the photos, so you'll lose the edges of your pics.  This may happen if you print directly from the card; I haven't checked.  This cropping is really an inexcusable bug in the process.  My advice is to save your money and let a store print your photos"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Poor Quality,"I've gotten virtually no benefit from this.  The tags aren't reliable.  I recently walked around my house carefully pressing all of the remote buttons, even though nothing was lost, and it located none of the tags.  The batteries in the remote were new.  I've found that I need to reseat the batteries in a given tag whenever it stops working - annoyingly, randomly and frequently - which ironically I don't recognize I need to do until I, ummmm, locate the tag.  They do get points for customer service - one of my tags arrived DOA which Sharper Image did politely and promptly replace free of charge."
electronics,,5.0,good sound quality for this price,No problems so far. I had these headphones for two months and they are great
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Very NICE!,"I love this thing!  I get to play all my songs at home without switching CD's back and forth or wearing earphones and it comes with a remote, plus it charges up your player and the sound is great!  What more can you ask for - just buy it if you have this brand for your MP3 player"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Best microphone pickup,"I have a Panasonic 5.8GHz phone, and I bought a KX-TCA92 foldable headset with it.  It is a stylish headset, along with volume control and mute on the cord (you have to keep holding it to mute).  However, the microphone is on a rigid short broom, placing it a couple inches from my mouth.  I often get request from the other party to speak up with that headset, and frankly, I don't enjoy yelling with the headset all day long."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Great picture, but there was a dealbreaker for me.","Other reviews cover this DVD player well, so I'll just add my two cents' worth here: HDMI and coax digital out, but no digital optical out? Bizarre. Since my TV can't take the HDMI in signal and pass the digital audio back out, that killed it for me."
electronics,,4.0,So Worth The Money,It's super fast and the a & g band frequencies don't seem to interfere with any of the appliances. Setup was fairly easy but cluggy.
electronics,2 of 8,4.0,"Nice, but not good for live recording","These are excellent headphones but understand that these are ""open"" headphones meaning they let outside sound in. For live recording they are totally unacceptable.  Headphones are comfortable and they sound fine, but if you're wanting to block outside noise, these are NOT the headphones for you.  For live recording (closed headphones) the best Sennheiser has to offer, I believe, is the much cheaper HD280s which aren't in the same league as these.  I'm disappointed Sennheiser doesn't have a ""pro"" closed headphone."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Quality at an Unbeatable Price,"This sturdy, high gloss photo paper produces professionally pictures; highly recommended, both product and seller"
electronics,,5.0,Ipod takes another blow," Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment"
electronics,,4.0,great,i love the fact that i only have to add the phone numbers into 1 phone and then push a button and then they are transfered into the other 3 phone
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"Amazing clarity, better than all other Panasonics","I picked up the KX-TCA88HA about three years ago from a big-box electronics store, and I have been very pleased with it.  The sound quality is tremendous, and other headsets I've used have been susceptible to some interference, but not this one.  I have used it with a GE multi-line home office phone, and the Motorola MD600 series 5.8 ghz handsets seamlessly."
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Everything I want in a phone (almost),"For years, I've been searching for a phone that fits my needs."
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,Excellent quality,"I bought this to replace a new Uniden that had pretty terrible sound quality. For $17 more, this AT&T phone is worlds apart as far as the quality of sound. Loud and clear! I also like some of the features like being able to use them in ""walkie-talkie"" mode, a button on the base station that helps you find a wayward handset, the fact that phone numbers are stored in the base station and not in individual phones (no need to transfer the phone listings to the other phone), 10 different ring tones to choose from, easy setup, nice keys and display, any key answering, etc."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Perfect for what I wanted,"After reading so many reviews of similar products, I impulse bought this one before my trip.  However, I have had zero problems with it.  I drove from Atlanta to Chicago using this as my sole charger for my iPod mini.  It kept it charged the entire time and did not make it hot.  I listened to my iPod the entire way through my car radio and I had no static during the trip (well, once when going under a HUGE bridge).  I loved that it comes with a long cord.  I keep my iPod on the dash (one one of those rubber gripper pieces) and it reached easily.  Could pick it up to adjust the playlist and put back with no problem"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Do NOT save on your charger!!!,"I had one of these because I was too cheap. :( It toasted my iPod on the first charge. If you are lucky, you may get one that works. If not.."

electronics,7 of 9,5.0,A great value,"With the rebate, this was a sound purchase. The data transfers super fast. It interfaces with my VR Sound frequency modulator so I can listen to mp3's in my car directly from this portable flash drive."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Whole house distributed audio - wireless - synchronized music streams from your Windows PC,"I was not originally a fan of iTunes on Windows. Avoided it like the plague, prefering alternatives such as realplayer and anapod. My wife however loved iTunes for the convenience of the iTunes music store. We both have iPods and car integration and I was fine without iTunes in my life (esp. on Windows)."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Awesome Mouse,"I initially bought this mouse for my boyfriend as a birthday present.  I read all of the reviews and this one seemed like the best one for the money, and thats exactly what this mouse is.  After using this mouse just a weekend, my boyfriend and i both fell in love with it.  (I've since bought one for myself) We had none of the problems other people have had with it, the buttons are easy to program and we've never had a problem with it not working.  This mouse is great for a variety of games, but we use it primarily on World of Warcraft and Counter Strike.  With both games this mouse is perfect. I highly recommend it"
electronics,,5.0,Great price,Very good seller to deal with. They are very prompt in sending the items that I order. I would do business with them again
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Nice Phone System,"Have had the Panasonic KX-TG5634M 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange� Digital Cordless Answering System with Four Handsets working for about a month now. The intercom/walkie-talkie function between the handsets is cool. The phone works pretty clearly throughout our multi-level house, and is even very clear when answering a call or using the intercom from the neighbor's house. The phone number function works well; it's convenient that each phone has a separate phone bank and the numbers can be copied between phones. The batteries, so far, give my daughter more than four hours of talk-time before charging, though, it could be longer; we curtail her chance to push the limit. Being able to plug in a headset is also a plus. I recommend this phone system"
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this unit in 2004 and I received the HO3 error and the unit does not work any longer. I called Panasonic and was told the 90 days warranty is up and I would have to pay for the repairs and labor!!! I told them to go on line and there are 100's of complaints about this unit H03 error.
electronics,24 of 30,1.0,read the terms and condition pdf,"I bought this thinking ""Failures due to normal wear and tear"", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping.  However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT,"" is not covered.  This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty.  A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered.  Save your money"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Excellent Deal,"I picked these up for a 20 year-old JVC stereo/amp with a CD player hooked up to it for under $100. I wasn't expecting the greatest sound, but for Radio Shack clear-out speakers and a 20 year-old amp I got a crystal clear sound that sounds just as good as the Sony home-theater-in-a-box that I paid $400 for. The sub-woofer has a seperate volume control on the back, so you can decide how much bass you want. Excellent speakers for the price"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Initial Software Problem - Nano,I had a software problem the minute I plugged the nano into my computer.  It took me about 4 hours to find out that this is a common problem with the nano.  Apple tech support told me how to solve it by downloading updated software from their website.  Just make sure and download it with Antivirus and Antispyware off first.  Haven't had a problem with it since
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,well.... its a cable,perfect printer cable i have an HP Deskjet 3550 color printer and this cable has just been perfect...excellent price and serves the same purpose as other more expensive cables and for a college student the price is...need I say anything ;-
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,A great buy!,I travel regularly and needed something other than earplugs I could use to quiet the cabin noise. I am so happy with these I would recommend to everyone. The sound is really wonderful and the noise cancelling is remarkable. There is a bit of ear drum pressure from the sound cancelling however you get used to it.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great addition for the car.,The Lowrance 500C works great. It is especially helpful when making several stops in unfamiliar places. I was surprised to find it was able to navigate to my week-end home which is on a dirt road in the mountains. The mount is quite secure. My Nissan Pathfinder provides a space for the unit to rest. The screen is large and bright enough to see in all lights. Sound from the power cord is loud and clear without attaching to your speakers. The unit is heavy but detaches easily when it is removed. I purchased the unit from Amazon who delivered it promptly as promised.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro,"I have purchased and tried Bose, Sony, Bang and Olufsen, Shure and none of them compare to the Super.fi 5 Pro's.  They have a tremendous sound range of crisp highs and rich bass, not an over kill thumpy bass at that.  Why do I love the earbuds, I don't like the weight or the heat produced as my ears sweat if I wear them for extended periods.  The cost is a bit high for most earbuds but very well worth the investment.  "
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,Great printer but...,"the documentation and installation manual should be abandoned immediately.  Also, the supplied ethernet cable did not work.  It was a combination of the extra plastic gaurding over the clips on each end of the cable, which thoroughly prevented either end from being plugged into either the printer or the router.  Also, I was only able to use the third installation option where you have to set up the printer via the ethernet cable.  Nowhere does it inform you of the most important step of the installation process.  After the WPA information is transferred to the printer, you actually have to remove the ethernet cable from the printer in order for it to connect to the network.  You will receive the Network Status: Not Connected, until it's removed."
electronics,11 of 13,1.0,This TV is defective!! Buyer BEWARE!,"Before you purchase this TV, be a smart consumer and read the reviews by typing in the product name in Google. I had the same problems that many of these people have stated. I bought the set in January 2005, and in March 2006, the picture and sound stopped working, and I was getting a flashing red light. After reading all of the comments on the net, I contacted Sony. I thought I'd share my story, so maybe some of you would be better informed about the set before buying it, or if you already have and it breaks, take heart and fight the way I did."
electronics,3 of 17,1.0,"TITLE? How about ""Worst Product I Have Ever Used.""","This is one of the worst products I have ever used. It gives you no detailed instructions for ironing on, like how long you are supposed to do it; it just says ""iron the transfer onto light fabric."" It ruined the brand new white tank top I bought for this project...and left me angry and frustrated. I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option! Phone # on package, but you end up with an answering machine, and I did find in very small print (that you aren't looking for when shopping) it does say, ""We shall not be responsible for incidental or consequential damages related to the use of this product."" I guess that says it all, doesn't it"
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,A slow burner,The first thing I'll say is that these headphones need a lot of breaking in - more than the 10 hours mentioned in the previous review. I've been using them for over a month now and finally they're sounding sweet. It was the same story with some other Sennheisers I had a few years ago - they really take their time to settle down.
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,JUNK !!!,Have had this 7410 for six months. It scans slow. It rarely will scan to Winfax. The software boo boos about every other time scan wise and must unplug replug. Ink is expensive. Software is absolute junk and makes it almost impossible to use your own scanning software. Card reader is OK. Copying is OK
electronics,,5.0,"great reception, lots of features","i have had this phone for about a month now and am satisfied with it.  tons of features, essentially like a cell phone (change ringers, screen colors and background, address book, etc..)."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Don't Every Waster your money,"I purchased Gigbit 3COM 3824...Extermely Bad on Gigabit...Many Errors with applications...Exchange Server, Remote Desktop, Loop In Network, Ultimately replaced it with LINKSYS...Much cheaper..but excellent performance,,,I am happy no"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Love it, works great on the Treo 650 with a Holux GPSlim 236!","I spent about a month online reading reviews, talking to friends and browsing websites researching routing software. Originally I was going to start out with an AAA map guides that I saw in Staples until I read the fine print which stated it would not work on the Treo 650 with Bluetooth. After research Delorme and a few others I decided on Mapopolis. Mapopolis gives you a 9 day trial period. The maps where dead on every time I used them and the POI's (Points of Interest) where up to date and extremely easy to use. The Mapopolis POI's just give you a dot on the moving maps while Tomtom uses a 24X24 BMP file so you can get a companies logo such as Dunkin Donuts or McDonalds. Mapopolis initially gave me trouble as they suggested loading as much as you can into the main memory. I drive all over Massachusetts on a daily basis so I needed a lot of maps. Mapopolis maps are set up on a county basis and you download them for each county. This insures you will also be using the latest most up to date POI's and streets. One of the reasons I had planned to go with Mapopolis over Tomtom was the price was cheaper and Tomtom limits you to two installs and then you need to buy everything over again to re-activate it. The initial activation is not too difficult, at least in my case it wasn't. Once you install the maps on your device you are asked to go on the Internet. The site listed never seemed to work so I merely went to www.ttcode.com and entered the number from my CD, then the number from my copy of Tomtom on my Treo and it gave me a third number which I entered on the device to activate it. This took all of about five minutes. Once I had Tomtom running it took seconds to configure for my Holux GPS and I loved the product instantly! The maps and displays give exactly what you need to know and are very readable even on a small screen. The prompts are easy to hear even in a noisy car. One of my most loved features is the near instant auto re-routes on even across state trips. I have my maps and most of the program loaded on the SD card and was concerned with speed. Mapopolis seemed to take a good while to calculate routes especially once I moved them to my SD card. Mapopolis was very stable and quick and if I had to complain about anything it would be the maps are slightly dated and the POI's only seem to cover about 15-20% of the places Mapopolis came with. The one saving grace here is that they allow you to add in categories of POI's and it is fairly easy to add a `single' POI at a time from Tomtom's interface. Unfortunately if you wanted to add all the Hess gas stations or all the Staples in your state you are going to be clicking and typing a lot on your Palm. Another fault with the POI's is Mapopolis allowed you to bring up information on POI simply by tapping the POI on the screen, when you tap Tomtom's screen you get to the configuration menu's"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Shakes the walls, bothers the neighbors, adds great bass... what more could you want from a sub?","I purchased this sub to complement two polk audio speakers for a 2.1 system.  After browsing around online as well as some in person visits to stores, this is the most bang for the buck one could get from a sub.  Whether watching a movie, or listening to music, the sub adds such rich bottoms, I'm very happy"
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Recommended buy,"This radio works great.  I work in a warehouse at night and like to listen to both talk radio on AM and fast rock music on FM to keep me going all night.  I get great reception in 90% of the warehouse which is as good or better than anything else I've tried.  The batteries last about 2.5 weeks (4 days a week, 8-12 hours a night)"

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Garmin carry case is a good investment,"Since I use my Garmin when hiking, exclusively, having the carry case has been the best investment for protecting my unit. The only way to carry the Garmin (this is the basic unit) without the carry case is either in hand, by the lanyard, or in a pocket.  The carry case has a nice clip that lets me attach it to my backpack where I can access it easily and still read the face.  The plastic face is getting a bit scratched up, which means the GPS unit IS NOT!  And when I've dropped it - more than once or twice - it provides just that little bit of extra protection.  At the same time, easy enough to get the GPS out of the case to use with the computer or what ever.  Its cheap enough protection, for your GPS investment"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Logitech Quickcam IM w/HDST ( 961361-0403 ),"All I will say is that I was away from home sent this to my wife she installed (says alot) and we were able to communicate.Image clarity excellent,set up is  a breeze and can be used right out of the box,the headset included in the package made this a one stop product and for laptop users the camera base shapes to fit  overall extremely good product"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,bad sound quality,"This product is a nice idea, but the sound quality is bad. I use a MAC G5 and get a nice clean sound on the speaker when directly connecting to the computer but the background noise jumps when using the switch. I don't recommend, unless you have a low-end system with a big noise floor already."
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Died after 6 months,"We had liked this clock for a variety of it's features, but can not recommend   it because it died after 6 months. There is only a 3 month warranty-clue"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great little speaker!,"I bought this unit so I could have background music during parties and other events at my house. When it's just me, I can crank it up and the sound is pretty good. At more moderate levels, it's excellent. I've tested it with heavy metal, classic rock, dance, jazz and ballads. As you will undoubtedly read when looking at similar product reviews, the bass is not very strong, but it's not supposed to be on an item of this price. I gave this 5 stars because it performs perfectly for what it is intended for. And free super saver shipping is nice too"
electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Worse Ever Keyboard,What an experience ! I have had to re-install the setpoint function repeatedly (8 or 9 times) in the first two weeks of use and it still doesn't work. It seems to drop out when the computer is shut off. In addition the software is the slowest I have ever used and the help funtion is useless. It is impossible to contact anyone about problems.

electronics,,5.0,Good little product,The WG111T worked fine on my XP system. It replaced the last 802.11b adapter on my network and allowed me to shift to an all G network. The WG111T is always connected and on without any problems.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Feature Rich and a cool toy.,"This phone was very easy to set up; yes, you have to read the directions!  Pairing it with my PPC-6700 was painless and making or receiving calls on this system on my mobile or land line work perfectly. The hinge is a bit on the flimsy side but I hope it holds up for a while.  It's a great system in the way it behaves like a mobile phone with a CD to download backgrounds and ring tones.  You do have to keep the mobile phone near the base unit due to bluetooth limitations but overall it's great"

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Not bad at all,"I think the best part of this player is the FM modulator. Plug it into your cigarette lighter and not only does it power your player but also transmits the sound to your radio. The picture controls seems limited however, not much you can adjust. Also comes with a nice carrying case."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,"Lovely printer, price makes it even more lovely","I purchased this printer based on reviews of others,which is how I make most purchases from Amazon (great feature!).  It is a great printer, I love it. I put out a montly newsletter and the images printed on this machine is so superior to any thing I have used thus far.  It makes my canon pixma ip4000 and it's documents look like a piece of junk"
electronics,,4.0,Solid purchase,"I've had a pair of JBL's w/ 10"" drivers for almost 10 years now and finally decided to add surround sound to the package.  I picked up this center channel along with a pair of bookshelf speakers for my rear channels.  The center channel has very clear sound - excellent voice quality.  For a lot of music, I keep it in surround for the crispness it provides.  A bit on the large side, but definitely a solid purchase"
electronics,,4.0,Carrying case for Garmin QUEST 2 GPS,"The case is great! The QUEST 2 unit fits snuggly and appears to be well-protected, but I haven't tried dropping it from any dizzying heights, though!!  The reason I didn't score it a 5 is that there is no simple way to hook it to one's belt, as with most cellphone pouches. I don't think to have it swinging freely would be practical, especially if one is out in the bush."
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,Great Bargain!,This Holiday season was my first attempt at making my own cards and this product proved to be a champ.  It is very reasonably priced and produced great results.  No jams in my H-P printer and I was able to get usable products from every sheet.  Highly recommended and less expensive than competition
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,I must say.... I'm Impressed with Koss!,"I researched ANR headphones and found this pair of headphones, the Koss QZ50. I bought the QZ50 because of the wraparound the head style. (my favorite, not to mention cool looking) I was skeptical of its ANR abilities because it's low low price compared to some other Bose ANR headphones ($250++) and I am _impressed_ with the sound quality and the ANR abilities. I could not hear jets flying over the Potomac River to land at National Airport from my house when I turned the ANR on. (no music playing) A GOOD BUY!"
electronics,,4.0,Good Product,"This product is a very good product in terms of reception while you have it connected in your 12v connector, it does not perform well if you have it on batteries only."
electronics,,4.0,Nice but a little bulky,"The product itself works great. Easy to connect, backlit display and works through the entire FM range instead of 4 or 5 presets. Being able to plug it in for home use with the provided AC adapter is great as well (not that you can't already play it through your pc but it's nice to have the option). My only complaint would be the 'visibility' of the trasmitter if you leave it plugged in when not in your vehicle. It's rather large and fancy looking, if it were a little less obvious it would be perfect"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Great product, performed as expected.","These plugs worked exactly as I expected them to. I also bought a Belkin crimper tool in order to crimp the actual cables into the plugs. However, even though they are so cheap here, it might actually be cheaper to go to the store and buy them because the S&H is greater than the actual cost of the product! If you don't want to bother with the hassle of going to the store, then this is a find product for you"

electronics,11 of 12,5.0,How to solve the problem to maximize the card,"All large SD cards require you to section the card like drives.  So all you guys have to do is to create folders and then save the files into sectioned folder.  I was able to use all 4 GB this way.  I ran into this problem before and finally search and found the answer.  If you just save the files straight, it max out at 1.2 or something.  This is prevalent for all large SD card.  This product was perfect"
electronics,,5.0,just as good as the extremely expensive ones,"This thing works great!!!  The only thing that kept it from working great right out of the box was the signal my router was sending out.  Once that was changed, haven't had a single probelm since.  Took no configuration, awesome deal, saved so much money"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Great price, great sound","Works great. Very convenient, easy to use, great sound, great price"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Phone!,"I got to agree with the other reviewers. This is one of the best phones I ever had for my kitchen-the extra large LIGHTED caller id feature was the selling point for me. It does require you to plug it in, but you don't have to worry about batteries leaking or running out. The speaker part has adjustable volume, and the caller id itself has contrast adjustments, it lists how long you have been on the phone while you are on that call, and one of the best parts is, if you get multiple calls from the same phone number, it will list each call and time INDIVIDUALLY, not overlap them. Thinking about putting one in the bedroom so when someone calls at night you can see who it is without turning on the light. The only drawback is the phone doesn't sit in the cradle snuggly, so you will have to be a little more careful when you hang up. GREAT PHONE"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The Best of the Best,"Years ago, before the internet and who has the fastest computer, the thing to prize was one's stereo system. In many college dorms the and off campus apartments the envy was the person with the state of the art system. Names like Crown, Sansui,JBL and Altec were to be coveted. Koss Pro 4AA's were (and still are) the phones to have. To have a set of these phones again is a shear treat and compared to the money you can spend a great bargin. Are the heavy? yes but the sound rivals the sound of the great major speaker systems such as JBL and Altec, only for your head. No! they're not for jogging or yoga but for serious music listening.     "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Great Product,I am very pleased with this product.  It is very easy to operate and the reception is very good. I like that it is so compact and easily moved to wherever I want to use it.  The only thing that would make it better would be a backlight for the clock display

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great value.  Highly effective.,"While I have had no experience using GPS instruments before, I found the Garmin c330 easy to use and invaluable when traveling to previously unknown destinations.  It took me through the Washington DC maze of interstates and local streets without the anxiaty usually associated with this itinerary.  I move the unit easily between my SL600 and my BMW 740iL, both of which were models not equipped with navigation systems when purchased. I take the c330 on trips where I use a rental car.  Well worth the money"

electronics,,4.0,Great phones at a great price,I did a lot of research on cordless phones before replacing my old junky VTech phones.  I was looking for 2.4GHz phones due to the static that seems inherent in 5.8GHz phones.  This is a nice set of phones for a ridiculously low price.  The phones work great.  Sound quality is generally excellent with no static.  No problems so far. 
electronics,35 of 37,4.0,Works great!,"I found the Rikaline 6010 GPS unit while looking for a nice dedicated gps module. It supports the standard NMEA protocol, and my unit has a permanent usb cord, though I know there are models with interchangable interfaces for pda's and serial connections."
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"Pretty Straightforward to Use, but Great Anyway","Basically, most people don't have a Mac computer, so most people only have USB connectors on their computers. So go to TARGET and get this Dock Connector for $14.95. It works great for USB ports, and the great Apple interface makes updates a breeze. Overall, great product for computers other than Macs"
electronics,23 of 24,5.0,GREAT!,"I got an orange 512MB one from another online site about a year ago.  I have treated it rather badly.  It has been to Turkey and Egypt with me, gotten crushed in my purse, dropped, bounced, and tossed.  It just keeps on going.  Now, sometimes when it drops, it opens up along the sides just a bit - I push it all back together and everything's fine.  Sometimes the battery door will pop off when it drops, no problem - put it back together it just keeps going.  There was a point where it needed new firmware, but CREATIVE's customer service is definitely up to par,  directions were very simple, and it was soon running again.  (I  think it was a complication from my Audible.com audiobooks.)  Very easy to use, and if you are (hypothetically) driving while it's plugged into your car stereo, and you want to change the volume, or flip to the next file, there's no need to look at it to handle the controls, as they are very intuitive.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Works great - but steep learning curve,"I purchased the GPS10 to use with my HP2495 PDA. The GPS technology is great - and still borders on magic - but the setup and use of the Mapsource software that's included with the receiver is a little difficult (at least for a guy like me who hates to read the instructions). Once you get it all figured out and configured correctly, the system does work as advertised. I just completed a trip from OKC to Dallas and I located a half dozen addresses all around the DFW Metroplex with no problem. I would like to see some kind of a battery status indicator on the receiver but since I run mine off my car's power outlet all of the time I guess that it doesn't matter. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Great Remote With One Annoying Problem,"The title of my review may seem like a contradiction so I will explain what I mean. This remote is highly versatile and can replace just about any remote. I won't get into all the details since first of all I'm not very good at explaining all the technical details and many others have written some fine reviews on how great this remote is. My main purpose is to let others know that there is one flaw in this remote that could  potentially have been a major one, if it weren't for the fact that you can program any button on this remote to take the place of any button on a original remote."
electronics,9 of 10,1.0,Don't waste your Money. ,"I'm looking for a new shedder and I have to vent about this one. I got mine at office depot and lost receipt.

It died. Waste of money."
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Does its job,"I used this cable with my new Sony (forget model) upconverting DVD player. It works fine. Obviously in the end, it is your DVD player and TV that do the magic. This guy is merely the messenger. If not anything, it is a one to one cable connection as opposed to an S-Video and Audio cable. The price of HDMI cable seem to vary from outrageously 100$ to ridculously 15$ making me wonder if there was QC issue. I stuck with Acoustic Research because it is a well known company"

electronics,,5.0,Awesome multifunction laser fax machine,I have a home-based business and does a lot of faxing (both incoming and outgoing). I have no complains about this bad boy. I also used it as a network printer. Had a little problem installing the network drivers but with some help from Brother customer support I was able to get it up and running in no time. One of the best customer services I've ever dealt with. Distinctive ring feature works very well too. I have a single phone line that receives both fax and voice. The only issue I have with this unit is it cannot receive incoming faxes over the network. You have to attach the USB or parallel cable to be able to receive incoming faxes to your computer. I think the reason for this is that the machine does not know which computer on the network to send the incoming fax to. Maybe in future upgrades they can add a configuration to enter destination IP address(es) for incoming faxes if you want to receive them directly to a computer in your network. 
electronics,,4.0,"Pretty good product, just a bit slow when copying.","Verbatim DVD-R aren't too bad, only burned a couple cds so far with the new DVD-R's haven't had a problem with any yet, hopefully stays that way.  The burning process itself takes kind of long, but overall the quality after it's done is nice compared to the original copy.  From experience with the Verbatim CD-R's there were many cds in the pack that did not burn correctly, hopefully it is different with their DVD-R. "
electronics,23 of 23,1.0,terrible GPS and sub-par customer service,"I purchased a TomTom Go and have had problems with the touch screen ever since.  It malfunctioned within 6 months of purchase and I had to send it in to be repaired, they said they were unable to repair it and sent me a brand new one.  The new one began malfunctioning in exactly the same way within another 6 months.  After the subsequent 6 months, I sent it back again for the same problem and they told me it was out of warranty and they no longer repair the TomTom Go but they would send me a newer model for an additional $300-400.  Ridiculous, I have been trying to get some sort of satisfaction to no avail.  I paid nearly $1000 for this unit when it came on the market and it never worked more than 6 months at a time.  It would be best if this company went out of business in my opinion especially after reading the other reviews listed here.  I am now having to ""trash"" my unit and buy a different, more reliable, brand."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent Value for the $$$$,"I go back a ways with Internet telephony. In the mid- to late-1990s, I used Net2Phone. Reception was always fuzzy and I remember buying several headsets that used separate plugs for the microphone and speaker that connected to jacks on the sound card. The voice quality with those cheap headsets was so bad that I finally broke down and bought an expensive USB headset. Only then, I was able make calls where the sound quality was tolerable."
electronics,1 of 6,1.0,Waste of Money,"I bought this item about 6 months ago and the U3 never worked. I went to the company for help and I give customer service a ZERO. They will never deal directly with you, it is necessary to create an account on their server and go through the account. Being a traveling person, they kept closing the account. Finley the last time no response from them. It does work as a 1.9GB thumb drive, big deal"
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,Oh well....,"I purchased the TuneJuice with the hope that it would give my fifth generation iPod a few extra hours for me to watch video. Suffice to say, it doesn't work. The TuneJuice gave me fifteen minutes or so of extra battery time. I should've known it was too cheap to be any good. My advice: get one of the more expensive battery packs--they probably work better"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,satisfied ipod cover customer,"I was very satisfied with the ipod covers,  they are very durable and versatile.  This is also a company that carries a lot of items which I will purchase in the future.  Matter of fact I was able to purchase from them an item which I have been searching for for a long time - hot water dispenser"
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Reasonably Happy,"The carrying case is fine.  Since I live in California, I am unable to use the windshield mount for the GPS.  Getting the dashboard mount into the case is a bit of a push.  It works but is much more crowded than with the winshield mount. It would have a little better had it somewhat larger"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Survived the washer AND dryer!,"Maybe this is a feature of ALL compact flash cards, but this card has survived a round-trip through my washer and dryer, hot water wash and cotton (hot!) cycle in the dryer. WOW. And the pictures were all still there and I've had no problems in the six weeks since then storing and retrieving files. Great product"

This remote does not work for me in several areas... it only works well with my TV, Sharp.  "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Loads of Fun,My 16 month old son got this for Christmas and he loves it.  the drumsticks are just the right size for his hands as well as the Mini maracas and tambourine.  I know that he may seem a little to young for this set but he really enjoys making noise with it
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,GREAT PRODUCT GREAT PRICE,I had no problems with these dvd's. Every movie I burned worked just fine with Verbatim. The price is not expensive and they work great
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Etymotic ER6i,"TERRIBLE product. sounds like a bad transistor radio, all treble, limited mids, non-existent bass. my other $9 earbuds that sound WAY better. I adjusted the EQ on my IPOD, my other $9 earbuds still sounded WAY better."
electronics,,4.0,"Really nice , but it takes time to love 'em","I see a few negative comments, I think they are due to not taking the time to experiment with how the earphones sit in your ear...take the time to find the right sized rubber inserts ( i think the foam ones are useless, but maybe thats just me) ... then take the time to learn how these need to 'sit' in your ear for proper sound."
electronics,8 of 8,1.0,poor quality and terrible customer assistance,"The unit might not seem expensive and some of the audivox portable DVD players come with nice featuressuch as multi-system or as a package with car mount and ear phones. It's a lure! Mine stopped working within a month and after 3-4 uses. It stopped spinning the discs. Even though covered by the 90 days waranty...I had to ship the unit to Auduxox, at my own cost, and by the time I got it back to test the repaired one, it was past the 90 days. Sleek! Plus the battery is hooked up on the outside of the unit, with very unsecure hooks. At the slightest touch, it gets disconnected. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Loudness?,"First of all, these are good speakers, nice design but it has one flaw."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good deal for the $$,"I bought this headset to replace a lightweight model that had broken.  These headphones are worn behind the neck style.  sound quality is pretty good.  The mic is clear and picks up your voice well.  The mic is adjustable up and down but you cant position it closer to your mouth.  The inline volume control is a nice touch so you wont have to exit a game to adjust the volume.  The headset is pretty comfortable unless you plan on wearing it for a long time.  After about two hours of playing counter strike source or day of defeat source I'm ready for a break.  I must mention that these things are durable.  I think you could run them over with your car and they'd still function.  To me, that's their best feature since I've had other headseats break.  So if you're looking for a decent set of headphones that sound good and will take loads of abuse then these are worth considering.  There was a rebate available when I purchased these headphones which made this an offer that I couldn't pass u"
electronics,7 of 10,4.0,"Works well, needs minor improvements, though","Since I enjoy using my laptop sitting in bed or on the couch, this lapdesk works very well. It is wide enough to hold a Dell Inspiron 5100 and have room on the side to use as a mouse pad. Folded, it raises the laptop off my desk giving excellent air circulation beneath."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great product,"Many people complain that these really decrease sound quality. If you go into the EQ part of the settings and set the sound to ""Treble Booster"", it really doesn't sound bad at all. Sure, the treble isn't amazing, but without the ear buds the earphones just suck. They don't fit in my ears at all. These buds make them so comfortable."
electronics,21 of 22,4.0,Good external stereo speakers for laptop,"I was hoping to find a set of compact powered stereo speakers for my laptop, but I wasn't particularly successful. I did however find these passive speakers from Sony. They work pretty much as I expected them to work. In a more general product rating forum, someone complained that they were not loud enough. These speakers are not designed to be used out-doors at poolside parties or anything like that. They are quite adequate to the task of producing stereo sound in a quiet office or home environment. They have interchangeable bezels one set which is translucent and the other set is snow white. This suggests that they were designed to be used with the Apple Macintosh iBook line of laptop computers. In general, I am very happy with them. I am giving them four stars instead of five because of the difficulty in transporting them. The two speakers are inseparable. They are joined by their audio cable and are of irregular physical design. The problem would have been partially solved if Sony had included a drawstring bag to hold them while they are being transported"
electronics,8 of 18,1.0,Watch it!  This is a DVD only - a CD drive won't read it.,"Neither the Garmin site nor this one make it clear that this is a DVD only.  The product is not available at all on CD, and it will not install on a PC without a DVD drive.  Second, you will be disappointed in this product's user interface.  It is clumsy at best, and will be unuseable for some"

So not only is this great for travel (with the 110-240 volt range, small size, etc.) but in my experience it works a lot better than other non travel modems for every day use"

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great sound but don't quite fit....,"I bought these earphones to replace the set I got with my SanDisk Sansa M240 MP3 player. As for the sound, they are a little high on the treble ends, to he point of being ""tinny"". Just not enough bass. Could be the player as I have not yet tried them with anything else. The fit is excellent in the ear canal but over the ear, well it could be better. Maybe I just have big ears??"
electronics,,1.0,Would have been just the thing,"Would have been just the thing if it didn't buzz all the time.  XM Radio sounded O.K.  For the price I didn't expect super ""Hi-Fi"" quality.  But the darn thing had a constant buzz in the back ground.  I exchanged it and it was replaced by another with the same problem. Returned that too.  All in all I spent better than half the price of the unit on shipping and return shipping and I'm still looking for a speaker-docking system of this type for my Tao.  If you find one that doesn't buzz at this price it's not a bad deal.  Also you should know, there is no ON/OFF switch or button, it's on all thie time"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Sad! Because I have to keep it for my birthday!,"This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems"
electronics,,4.0,Garmin GPSMap 60cs,"This GPS is a pretty good deal for the money.  From an operational standpoint, it works well.  It is apparent though, this is really all about being portable, the screen is too small for good marine or car use.  For my use, mostly marine, I set a lot of waypoints and scrolling on this tiny of a screen is just lame.  Not any fault of the unit I know, just something to think about"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"With a lack of options, this does the job...","After searching for a case of this type for my U2 ipod, I settled on this one because it's the only one of its type I found available.  First, I'm disappointed that there are so few available for us ghetto-ipod owners. =)  The only clear cases I could find were for the nano, shuffle, and video.  This is the only one for my 4th gen U2 special edition so my choices were limited.  "
electronics,,5.0,Great MP3 player,"I purchased this item initially because of the price, compared to the IPOD's.  I LOVE it! My husband has the video IPOD and his battery needs charged every day.  I have never had to charge this MP3 player yet! It goes for 50 hours- I ordered the mini sony speakers for it so I can listen to it at work on my desk or anywhere.  The only downside is that Sony quit making the armband for it so I am having a hard time finding a holder for it. It fit my needs perfectly"

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,"These really, really suck.","I am not one of those snobby audiophile people. I don't use all those silly terms and pretend I can hear some decreased audio quality at sound frequencies only my cat hears. But I do know crap when I hear it. So let's start off with the most basic function of these ear buds - to deliver decent quality sound to your ears. They fail at that. My crappy $[...] Sony earbuds and the ones that came with my iPod both sound a lot better. (Unfortunately for me, the dog chewed up both pairs, which is why I bought the Philips buds to begin with.) And as for the ""surround sound"", well come on, you really didn't expect that for $15, did you? "

It is long enough to give great flexibility with arraging whatever it needs to be connected to.  The price is extremely good (even though amazon.com changes it every now and then) for this cable.  It is way more expensive in stores.  And getting a Belkin product for such a low price is excellent.  This is totally worth the money, and is a great buy if you need a USB cable"

I originally got an Energizer rechargeable universal battery; it only lasted about an hour and a half with the DVD playing. So we ordered this. It has regularly lasted over four hours, and closer to FIVE - about three times as much as the Energizer. Its a bit lighter, too, and it cost $15 LESS. Just make sure your DVD has a 9 volt input"

It developed a porblem with the display, so I called Beltronics so that I could get it repaired. Surprise! Surprise! The lady there told me they will not honor the warranty of any Beltronics radar detector not sold by an ""authorized reseller"" and she told me that Amazon is NOT an authorized reseller. So if you buy your radar detector from Amazon or other non authorized dealers, they will not honor the warranty if you have a problem. Check Beltronics web site to verify this!"

I too, ordered the blue-packaged tapes to go with my new camcorder and received the foreign label that is NOT, and I repeat, is NOT listed in the manual to be appropriate ones to use.  Amazon should eliminate this vendor, since they are NOT sending what Amazon is advertising.  The yellow-packaged tapes are DVM60PR3.  Approved tapes are DVM60PRL or DVM60EXL.  I guess I just ate it for the cost of 6 tapes, and will now have to drive an hour to WalMart to be sure I get what I need for the camcorder.  Amazon, shame on you.  There are numerous comments regarding this same issue.  Take care of it!!"

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent Headphones,"I recently embarked on a search for the best over-the-ear headphones I could buy, within reason. It did not take long to figure out that the contest was between Sennheiser, Sony and Bose. I eliminated Sony based on owning their MDR-V6 headphones before and wanting a different sound (Sony phones tend to stress the highs). I eliminated Bose based on the price and customer reviews noting the lack of quality (apparently they have great customer service but everybobdy seems to know that they have great customer service  because the've had to replace their headphones)."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Amazing Customer Service though....,"I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card'  message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well"

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,AT&T telephones are #1,"I read all the previous reviews. It seems that the biggest negative for this telephone was that there was no central phone directory and that you couldn't clear the calls on the handsets from the base. I find these missing features a plus! I have the base unit with 4 handsets. We each store our own personal phone numbers on individual handsets and we can clear the call list when we want. The speaker phone feature on the handsets comes in nice when you have been put on indefinite hold and using the remote access from the handset to get messages from the answering machine is a nice feature. We like the verbal announcement of the number from the base unit so we can choose to pick up or let it go to the answering machine. Sound quality is excellent! Everything works as expected. In comparison to the Panasonics I have been frustrated with for the past few years these are top of the line! Historically I have never owned a bad telephone from AT&T. Oh, transfering calls from one handset to another is really great too!"

electronics,,5.0,Garmin GPS 72,I have owned many garmin GPS devices over the years and the model 72 is superior to any I have had. The cost of this device can be quite steep these days and for someone who wants to use  one for local areas-why pay the extra cost?  At around $150-it is a bargain.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Quality Cable,"I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore"
electronics,24 of 25,1.0,Bad ipod case,"This case does not work well with the ipod.  When in the case, you cannot work the button controls-- rewind, fastforward.  The case scratches the ipod upon inserting and removing due to the hard leather stiching on the inside of the case.  Good idea, bad execution"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great radio!,"I bought this for my son and he really loves it.  The only negative is that you have to buy a case separately, and there are no wonderful styles & accessories to choose from (like the ipod).  I plan to eventually buy one of these for myself.  If you are an am radio junkie, this is the item for you. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good case for lots and lots of CD/DVD's,Is a good case for holding all your CD/DVD's. Only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I wish the pages were a bit more stiffer and the plastic binding looks like it might eventually break

electronics,,4.0,Traveling and trekking wih Kingston 1GB DataTraveler II,"I've known about the company for years, so this was one reason I chose this thumb drive.  The price was perfect for me at the time.  One flaw with this design, is the cap.  If the cap isn't attached to the rest of the boddy somehow, it is lost immediatelly if you are not careful.  It takes abuse well, I carry it on my key-chain and it gets bangged up quite a bit.  Kuddos for Kingston for designing it to take this type of mild abuse.  I wished the unit was smaller.  It's a little deceptive when you see it pictured by it self.  Lastly, the Data Traveler II works well on PC and Mac's, I'm happy with this purchase"
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,Easy to use basic recorder (uses DVD -R),"As previous reviewers indicated, good basic DVD recorder.  I suggest a starter recorder to replace VHS; you could buy a combo VHS/DVD recorder to archive your VHS library, but (1) dubbing is real time (if a tape is 2 hours, it takes 2 hours to dub to DVD), and (2) most commercial VHS tapes are coded to prevent dubbing."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great choice for my Nikon D70,"I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am.

I bought these and found they met the criteria very well, use them with a portable DVD player to review video tapes when on the road and need a quick review of the days tapings.  Also can use them with my laptop for better sound if presenting something.  I like the lid that covers them or acts as a stand and ease of plugging in to the headphone jack.  So far the battery life has been sufficient for my needs. "

electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Great picture,"I upgraded from the Samsung HD860 which upconverts to 720p and 1080i.  I was fairly happy with the 860 since it was a huge improvement over my progressive scan player. Since I have a new Samsung HL-S5087 1080p HDTV, I thought the 960 should be the perfect match. Ten minutes out of the box with the included HDMI cable plugged in and the Revenge of the Sith loaded and I could tell a definite improvement.  Breathtaking from the start, the blackest black and clearest details. Must be the DCDi Faroudja chip I have read about and expected to do just this.  No need to buy blue ray yet. Wow, a great DVD player and handles so many other formats as well.  I have not seen anything to complain about and I am a keen observer. I am very happy with this purchase"

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Works well,"Bought this card along with a Rebel XT as a gift for my girlfriend. It's been performing without a hitch so far, though on burst mode, there is transfer lag: in that, the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card, and so after the burst, the pictures are still being written to memory"

electronics,17 of 17,4.0,Great For Cell Phones,"I purchased the Mini SD 512 MB flash memory card for my LG 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone.  It was easy to install and I could use it right away.  Also it came with an adapter for the larger SD, so I can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if I so desired"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Great phones, but length of phone lines matters","We replaced an aged Merlin system with these phones, and in general we're quite satisfied. The only limitation we found was that we can't use all eight phones at once in our 13-room, 4-story house. Evidently, the total length of all the phone lines -- probably several hundred feet -- is just too long. With a bit of fiddling, we got seven working solidly, and they make for a terrific phone system that meets all our needs. We expect to use all eight instruments in time, as two or three separate systems, so I can forgive this one problem"
electronics,32 of 33,5.0,Awesome sound and great picture! ,"     This portable DVD player is the best one I've found. It has a 6 hour battery life, where most others have 4. I love it, and think the picture and sound quality are excellent. I was hesitant to buy it after reading some of the comments on the picture quality, but I am glad I did. Sure compared to my high def plasma it's not as good, but for a portable DVD player it's got an excellent picture. I am very happy with it. I like that the screen swivels up and down, makes it great for travel on an airplane or for hooking on the back of a car headrest. Also has two headphone jacks so you don't need a splitter if two people are watching!"

It fits comfortably in my hand, works on any surface--I even used it for a while on a polished, reflective steel surface without problems. The mouse is quite precise and gets excellent battery life off of the two AAs. And, it's a quite cheap! I certainly recommend this mouse"

electronics,,4.0,Great Stereo ,"I bought this stereo for my daughter's 9th birthday.  It's a great system with really good sound for the size.  It is easy use and is super thin and can hang on the wall.  It doesn't sit on a shelf easily; it tends to fall forward because it's heavier in front, so you should plan on hanging it"
electronics,12 of 15,5.0,But I won't order it from Amazon,"After speaking to both Amazon and Linksys customer service, no one can tell me what version I will get. Amazon doesn't have the version information and Linksys says that the distribution channel used to ship for Amazon contains mixed inventory so there is no way to know or predict what version will be shipped. Too bad to lose all the other great things about Amazon over sloppy supply chain management"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works Great ....,"I am very happy with this philips 4-device universal remote control. Very easy to set up. Took less than 10 minutes to program my Magnavox TV, Hitachi VCR and Cyberhome DVD player. I no longer need multiple remotes and can control all with this one remote. I bought Sony Universal Remote control V202 first and could not get it to even Power On. I am glad I bought the philips one after returning the sony one. I would definitely recommend the philips 4-device universal remote control to everyone"

electronics,21 of 21,5.0,The best portable DVD player for your girlfriend,"I bought this to use on my honeymoon.  My fiance tried it out flying from the East Coast to the West Coast for her bachelorette party and totally loved it.  The battery lasted for two movies easy, it was small, and the screen adjusts great for an airline seat.  My fiance hates all my technology stuff but loves this DVD player and says she likes it more than me.  Don't worry about complaints about the resolution - on a small screen it doesn't really make a difference - only on text when it first starts can you tell it isn't high resolution.  I find that with it plugged in, turning the brightness to +5 and adjusting the color to +2 or 3 produces a great looking movie.  Also this DVD player fits any type of format to the screen area as some others like the Toshiba SD-2800 do not.  I also stopped by a Best Buy and it was the brightest richest colored screen on a sunny day in the store by far."

The picture on my Monitor is less shaky. Also, the cord on it is extremely long, and the plug is almost flat to the wall. It is also a great deal because it comes with labels for the wires, and locking cable ties. I have bought one for my PC, and TV"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Disposable clock radio,"I liked this clock radio when we first bought it because of the feature of being able to wake up to a cd. But after less then a year, here I am trying to find a new one. One morning the power came on, but no music, the cd was spinning. None of the buttons would work, power wouldn't shut off so I unplugged it. Tried again the next day, and it completly shut off in the middle of the night.  I am very disappointed having loved Magnavox products in the past. Buy only if you want to buy a new one every 10 months"

I am ready to just buy a different brand because I have given up hope that they will ever do anything about the broken one collecting dust in my living room. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM SONY AGAIN"

Me permite llevar y modificar mis archivos de excel y de word. La uso como despertador y es perfecta para tener todos mis contactos y estoy seguro que todavia no uso ni el 30 % de todas las utilidades que me puede prestar.

It's going right in the trash."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Compatible with Sandisk pro duo,I purchased my adaptor directly from Sony's website (no tax + free S/H) for $9.99.  I was a little hesitant at first because I had a 1 GB sandisk pro duo card and I wasn't sure how it would work out.  But fortunately the Sandisk card + Sony adaptor work just great!  With this adaptor I can easily switch between a PSP and my digital camera

I have to plug the drive into one of the USB ports on the front of my computer.  I don't know what the difference is between the USB ports in the rear and the  front, I assume they're on a different USB Controller, but when I plug it into one of the rear ports, the drive shows up as dead/not working. Just be aware that if you have only one controller and it's the same as mine, the drive could seem to be DOA."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,To anyone who is annoyed by the lame U3 additions,"There is a quick and easy way to turn your disk back to a simple mountable drive. For Mac users, it will eliminate the additional folders and the annoying ""Untitled"" CD image popping every time you connect; For the PC users, it will eliminate the whole applications suite and control panel loading when connecting."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great remote with a great price tag!,"After doing a lot of research, and finally reading slick045's and Justin's review below (the icing on the cake), I decided to go with the 550.  I was looking for a simple, cool looking, rectangular remote that could control all of my devices (without breaking the bank).  Within an hour, I had the remote working exactly how I wanted (actually, in 10 minutes I had the first iteration of it going).  I was suprised that it even had my remote control lights in the online database (3BM, which is not a common brand).  I know a lot of people say the software is difficult, but once you spend 15 minutes playing around with it you will figure it out.  I am technically savvy but I don't think you need to be with this remote's software...in fact, I was glad it had so much programming flexibility.  The only ""major"" tweak I had to do was remove the delay on the 550 remote for my Scientific Atlanta cable box as there was a noticeable pause when entering channel numbers.  I did this by going to ""Adjust the delays"" for the device and changing the ""Inter-Device Delay"" from 1000ms to 0ms and walla it was as quick as the original cable remote.  I was also impressed how easy it was to set up the activities to do multiple commands at once.  Bottom line, definitely a smart buy.  As this is my first day with the remote, I will be sure to update if things change, but I really don't think they will.  I am a happy customer down from 6 remotes to 1"

It was a great travelling companion in Mexico! Romantic music, salsa dance tunes, and all of our favourite songs were with us daily, whether on the beach or in private. With the sound of a true stero system we were very impressed with the inMotion Plus."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Very well made!!,"This case is Very nice.  It has an aluminum outside with a nice rubber inside.  Actually this case can hold up to 16 memory sticks (8 memory stick duo and 8 regular memory sticks!)  There are special slots for the memory stick duo just under the slot for the memory stick, so one duo and one memory stick can fit in the same slot!  This is great for me because I have a Handycam which can hold only memory stick duos and a Cybershot which I use both memory stick and the duos. "

electronics,5 of 6,5.0,"Looks good, and sounds good.","Exactly what I wanted, a land line phone in case of power outages, with a cordless extension. The sound quality is good on both phones,the speaker phone is excellent. Best of all is the ease of use of the of the called ID, the answering system and the many other features."
electronics,7 of 11,1.0,Very unimpressed,"The weight change is nice but as you hold the mouse and put pressure on the top, the weight releases up into your hand. The physical size of the mouse is too small, it does not feel comfortable. The cable is very stiff and lies in loops across the desk. After several ejections of the weight, many small pieces of plastic were broken off and were discarded. I expect that to be called a gamer's mouse all these deficiencies need to be corrected.  Very annoying - I returned what was left of the mouse and received my money back and all this trouble was in two weeks time, save your money and get a logitech mouse"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best Deal Around!,"I bought (4) these cables to install in my basement that is being finished. They arrived in one day, in great condition, and work great. The price for these was unbelievable! The same cable at Radio-Shak would cost 5 times as much. Great price and delivery. Made in China, but work well"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good as they get,"I've been driving a Logitech Momo (black) for about 3 years, and loved it. Until now."
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Works on Mac OS X Tiger!,"I could not be more impressed. I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked, and they're all pretty much junk. This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk, and likely much further, but that's as far as I went. The quality on the other end is very clear. The manual is plain stupid, it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it, but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed, just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires. BTW, I am using it primarily with Skype."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Exceed Expectation,Found it online while it has a rebate and decided give it a try.  The performance is excedding my expectation.  I use it on my office desktop PC to connect to a Logitech Bluetooth headset and it working very well.  It even working close to 30 ft with my Nokia bluetooth headset (with few wooden walls in between)

You get all of the features and benefits of a dolby digital decoder, true sourround sound and a digital control unit. Sound is fantastic- You may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media player/sound card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output."
electronics,,5.0,Just buy this one.,"I've had three iSkins and have had almost no complaint over the last 3 years.  They are durable, WELL designed, elegant.  If anything, they may bulk the iPod up too much and sometimes the little cable flap sticks out a bit.  Other than that, they give you a feeling like you can actually roughly handle your delicate little jewel of an iPod"

electronics,2 of 7,5.0,AWESOME,"The ipod nano 2nd generation is fantastic. the sound quality is great ,using itunes is hassle free and the battery life is good.i admit the ipod screen is very easy to break but i put it in a sock to protect it because i bought the ipod about two weeks after it came out and i found out it needed a usb 2.0 which our house computer doesn't have so i am stuck using my sisters computer which she gets very frustrated because i am always using her computer and getting the ipod when it first came  out had a disadavantage like there is no hard plastic cover for it because it is a hair longer and thinner. but overall i LOVE it and i give it a 10 out of 10"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Indispensable travel companion,"I spend a lot on time on the road, and it is always a pleasure to plug in the i-Station so I can enjoy the music in my hotel rooms.  The sound is amazing for the size and price, although it does hit its limits at higher volumes.  It can use more lower frequency response, to play the notes in the lowest octave.  Also limited by the size is the stereo imaging.  If only the speakers can be separated."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"""OFF DA HOOK!!!""","I received my speaker system today and immediately installed them to my computer due to some of the negative reviews. But this speaker system is ""off da hook!!"" I love it! This system has better sound quality than I imagined for the price I paid.

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Has worked great both times I've used it,"I received this gizmo as a gift sometime ago, and have had to use it twice since then. Both times it took the skip away from my lightly scratched CDs. I followed the directions that came with the Skip Dr. (i.e., I kept the discs wet with resurfacing fluid, ran them through the gizmo twice, dried them off, and buffed them afterward) and the skips and scratches disappeared. I understand that I'll need to replace the resurfacing wheel after 50 or so uses, according to the literature included, but since I try to keep my CDs in immaculate condition, I hope it will be a good long while until this is necessary."
electronics,4 of 6,4.0,"Great PC Card, much less than great rebate experience","First of all, I must give the Netgear WG511 its props. It is streamlined, configures easily and rarely drops a signal. The installation/configuration instructions are painless and I had both the PC card and compatible Netgear wireless router up and running in less than 15 minutes. My issues stem from the manufacturers less than adequate rebate ""system"". Having jumped through all of their flaming hoops to get the rebate information to the manufacturer, I did not receive any word on my rebate for two months. When I did, I received an email saying my rebate request was not valid. Upon some further examination and making sure they were sent all the documentation requested, I called Netgear directly. As it turns out, Netgear told me my rebate was not valid because they didn't receive the original UPC for the purchased items. I explained (repeatedly) that I could only send and original ONCE, but offered to fax them all the documentation I had INCLUDING photo copies of the original UPC, to which the declined, stating their terms and conditions only honor originals. The supervisor I spoke with was in no way helpful or willing to attempt to resolve the situation when I asked, ""How can I submit originals when I sent them to you already?"" and, ""Let me fax you all the documentation I sent the first time..."" I was eventually given the ""I can neither confirm nor deny we received your original rebate request."" schpiel at one point. The kicker of this whole experience was that though I sent a rebate request for TWO items, Netgear only had a request for one item. Both item requests are on one form! ""How could you get a request for one without the other if they're on the same form?"", I asked, which was met by, ""Uh, at this time, according to our records, we only have a request for one item...If you send in a rebate request with the original UPC, we can honor your rebate request..."" Essentially, I will say this: Netgear makes a wonderful consumer product. The product is reliable, user-friendly and affordable. And, I would purchase from them again - as long as there's an instant rebate. If you send in a rebate, save yourself the aggrevation and just pay full price.       "

The router/card package were deeply discounted at brick and mortar store (hint: ""that was easy""), so I figured it would be a nice way to upgrade my laptop's wireless data transfer rate (at least while working at home with Netgear's proprietary higher data rate format)."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,i guess there worth it,i have to admit these cables give a very clear picture. they are however very pricey. less expensive cable may do the trick but i guess i paid for peice of mind knowing i have the best i can buy
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Good for price but not great sound,"I like this unit for the price, but was disappointed in the sound quality because I was expecting too much from the reviews. I don't know where all the claims of good sound quality are coming from because it's really not that great. My Altec Lansing inMotion iM7 has much better sound quality and far superior bass (but it costs a lot more). However, I think the sound is ""OK"" for the size of the unit and because of the price, size, and design, I'm giving it 4 stars. But don't buy this if you want very good/great sound quality. It's just ""OK"""
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Very pleased with this remote,"At my home I have most of my home entertainment components in a cabnet, behind a solid door.  I also have a projector mounted to my ceiling.  For the past year I have either had to operate my components by hand (DVD, DVR, Amplifier, Component Switch) or leave the door open so my IR controller would work.  After much research I chose the Harmony 890 as my new universal remote.  This is the ideal remote for my purposes since it utilizes both IR (infra-red) and RF (radio frequency).  I still need the IR for my projector mounted on the ceiling.  My biggest reservations were from reading the reviews that said set-up was a nightmare.  When I got the remote I took the advice of a friend and discarded the set-up CD and went straight to Logitech's website and downloaded the most current software.  This was very easy to install.  I was planning on the set-up to take all evening and maybe the next as well.  However, after a little less than 1 hour I was done.  I figured that was too easy, but when I tested it...everything worked perfectly.  I am so excited, this is the best universal remote investment I have ever made.  Just an FYI, the components I am controlling with the Harmony 890 are:  Marantz DVD, Marantz SR-18 receiver/amplifier, Panasonic HDTV Projector, Dish Network DVR and Psyclone 4 component switch. "
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,Sharp set sharper than a knife,"This TV marks my entrance into the HD era and WOW; this TV is amazing and at a great price. HD looks incredible, great black levels once everything is adjusted, colors have real snap to them with the four wavelength backlight. Standard definition looks better than my previous 27"" sony wega CRT, which is a high compliment for a hidef TV. Tonnes of menu options and user configurable picture settings for each input. I've had no trouble with viewing angle or back light bleed as reviewers on other sites have mentioned (I think those problems were associated with the first production run). And yes this TV accepts a 1080p input through component video (verified on avs forums). Video games look amazing, at least gamecube, ps2, and dreamcast, it goes without saying an xbox360 or ps3 would be mindblowing."
electronics,,5.0,Essential and great,"Tried the system without this little gadget and it was very cumbersome, had to pick up handset, lay it down, push button on headset.  With this little thingy, just push the handset button, makes the whole system much more efficient and pleasurable to work with.  If you buy the headset, buy this too."
electronics,2 of 10,5.0,Love this flash card...,I usually purchase Lexar cards for my 20D.   The sandisk was a better price so I decided to try it.   It is fast with its write speed.   I can pop off a number of images without having to wait for it to write to the card.   The image quality is excellent...I think that the colors may be a little more vibrant than the ones I have on the Lexar cards.   I think that I am going to switch to Sandisk

The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I  didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects:"
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Almost perfect,"Works OK, no technical problems at all, but you still have to use the stylus for some thing"
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Good Quality Product,"I was always skeptical of making the transistion to a CD wallet from my jewel cases.  This product is sturdy and the amount of space you save is well worth the change.  When you decide to make the switch, I would recommend this one.  I'm planning on getting a few more"
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,Wrong memory card,This item was offered as a promotuonal item included with the purchase of a Nikon P2 coolpix camera.However the compact flash memory card does not work with this camera only SD memory card.This a mistake made by amazon obiously I took it because I though that it worked with the camera. I have noticed that you have made a correction and in the latest promotion the SD memory card is offered.
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,Mac is not well supported,"I think maybe I'm having a bad experience with WRT54GS because I'm using both XP and OS X. Every other day, the router stop responding, then I can't even connect to the router until I reset it."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Get these, get these, get these!!!","These headphones are just incredible!  I really couldn't believe that it was possible to get such clear, crisp sound, with an equally crisp but powerful bass response, for a little over 10 bucks, but it's true!  I considered dropping $50-100 on a larger, ear-surrounding set of headphones because I wanted to get something with a really high-quality sound,  but decided I had nothing to lose with these at this price and with all of the favorable reviews.  I am still flabbergasted that a pocketable set of walkman/ipod-type headphones can sound this darn good.  There's really no excuse not to own these unless you don't know about them, and if you're reading this, you know.  "
electronics,16 of 16,5.0,Excellent Computer Speaker For The Price,"I cannot possibly imagine what the other reviewers expected. These are $70 computer speakers, not a multi-thousand dollar audiophile surround sound speaker system. For what these are, they deliver truly impressive sound - smooth, room vibrating, bass, crisp highs, and a midrange nearly perfect for computer games. If you prefer music, the midrange can be improved with only minor adjustments in a graphics equalizer - available in Windows Media Player (under ""Enhancements"" of the ""View"" menu) and any other decent media player. With a little equalizer tweaking, these speakers deliver exceptional music performance and are a true pleasure to listen to (rock, classic rock, jazz, or country)."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Neat little item!,Pretty simple device that can adapt to various windshields and arrangements.  Suction cup works great and hold the unit firmly in place.  I drive a Chevy Tahoe and this device gives me several mounting location options
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Really not worth your money and its overpriced ,"I was very interested in buying this product even before it came out, but I have to say I am disappointed.  This product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run, a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill.  I say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you, and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run.  This product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is.  "
electronics,1 of 5,1.0,I would rate this speaker  NEGTIVE FIVE star if I could  ,"Dear friends, "
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Better Value Than Many Other Cables,I have been involved in electronics for more than 25 years and have been building (and rebuilding) my home theater for most of my adult life.
electronics,,5.0,Very satisfied!,"I was thinking about getting wireless router, but upon hearing all the stories of the signal dropping here and there, I decided to simply get a longer cable to use my laptop in my bedroom...less expensive than having to buy another router. Overall, I'm very satisfied"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,a must have for a writer,"I am paranoid; I am also a writer so that means I am paranoid.  Computers take delight in crashing when you can least afford it.  My contracts said I must keep pack up copies of my books.  Here, comes the paranoia - I have 125GIG external Harddrive, 250 GIG, and six of these JumpDrive in various sizes."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Peice of equipment,"This is my 2nd transmitter/charger unit, the first was a Belkin. This Unit is far superior, holds the Ipod better, has more options for positioning the unit, more frequency's for reception, and transmits a very strong signal. I had it playing in one of my vehicles in the driveway whilst I moved my other vehicle out to the street, and the reception in the 2nd vehicle was excellent from 25-40 feet away. I will probaly buy another"
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Great buy for newbie who wants to have a great listening experience with out breaking the bank,"I owned a few pairs of headphones, from in-ear to sports to full size, this one is the best by far. I am not a music major, I can't tell the difference between how many dB and so on... and I honestly care less about those. If the headphone doesn't sound good to you, the spec is useless."
electronics,14 of 15,1.0,Don't buy from Philips!!,"This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room.  Assembly takes about two minutes.  The instructions are very clear.  The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film.  Why then do I give it one star?"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,There's a trick to getting it to stick.,"I've used this mount for over a year now, and once I figured it out, I haven't a problem getting it to stick to my windshield. (Often it sticks too well.) When attaching the suction cup to the windshield, position the locking lever so that it is perpendicular to the windshield. Place the suction cup against the windshield, apply pressure with the lever still perpendicular, and while applying pressure, lock the lever. (It helps to make sure the windshield and suction cup are clean.) Using this method to apply the mount, I've have it stay on for weeks at a time and not come off until I needed to remove it. Once in a while the mount will come off in the heat, but cleaning both surfaces fixes that."
electronics,,1.0,finicky and limited,"After hours of trying, including hired tech expert help PLUS an  electrician to hard-wire a special outlet, we think the poorly written manual explaining installation with a non-Netgear router (ours happens to be Linksys) is misleading.  The writing is confusing and the results predicted are just plain wrong.  We give up!  We ordered a Linksys Extender today to try to match our router, and now we are trying to figure out how to return the Netgear WBXB102 to get it out of our lives forever.  A failure experience all around, an expensive one, too.  Trying to be fair, and not just bitter, maybe this could have worked just fine with a Netgear router??  We chose to move on in a different direction"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good Investment,I puchased this jumpdrive over 2 years ago and I have no complaints in fact I would like to purchase the 1 GB jumpdrive
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,"Good quality cable, inexpensive","There isn't a whole lot to say about this cable. It works wonderfully, the cable is thick (i.e. not flimsy), the connectors are well built, and I like the braided-silver-wire appearance. Best of all, most stores mark up cables to outrageous prices but this particular cable costs nearly 70% less on Amazon than it does at various national-chain electronic stores. If you need a 4-to-6 pin firewire cable, this is the one to get. (That being said, make sure you need a 4-6 pin--small one one end, large on the other--cable)"
electronics,,4.0,full featured notebook mouse,"  It is just about the right size and shape to fit comfortably in your hand while still being small enough to travel. There are nearly infinite possibilities for customization of the buttons, which is both a plus and minus. All in all, a comfortable purchase"
electronics,,5.0,Of Mice for Men this one is Great,"This is a great mouse. The size is perfect because it isn't too big or too small. Also, the battery lasts forever. I've had the mouse for over a year, I  use it every day and I still haven't replaced the battery. I liked it so much that I got one for my Mom when she got a laptop. She's a flight attendant so she travels all the time and she really likes the mouse too. Good portability and functionability"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Pricey - But Worth It,This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter.
electronics,,5.0,Surfboard is smooth, I had a similiar modem before but it didn't work as smoothly.  This one is more dependable.  I would definitely purchase this item and not look for some cheaper deal (and risk getting something not dependable)
electronics,,5.0,Pleasantly surprised!,"I have purchased three chargers/transmitters before and have always been disappointed.  Either they only had 3 stations to choose from (which were not availabe in all areas) or they were so bulky I would hit them when changing gears in my car.  This is perfect.  The Monster Cable extends only 1/4 inch from the plug in and has 10 stations to choose from.  No, it doesn't have a handy cradle to sit in, but the cable is long enough that you can sit the IPOD in a cup holder, dash or console.  I am going to buy another one for our other car"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Simple and efficient,I have this mouse in white and it works very well.  The only thing I might like better is if it was cordless but I didn't want to spend much on such a basic piece of computer equipment.  I keep it on a mouse pad out of habit but it does not require a pad.  It's very lightweight and durable.  Logitech is a brand that I am new to but so far they have been excellent.  I would recommend this product highly
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Purchased Today; Returning Tomorrow,"I am a faithful Canon user, and I will always buy canon cameras and printers. After many years of great photographs printed with my old i960, the printer finally died; by ""died"" I mean it suddenly started turning all colors shades of red and yellow. So I went ahead and purchased the ip6700D tonight at Circuit City, and I will be returning it tomorrow. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,LOVE my Tivo - can't live without it,"I read some reviews that caused me to worry about glitches or stuff like that, but my Tivo is perfect - no problems whatsoever, and it makes my life so much easier!  I'm thinking about getting a second one"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Excellent keyboard - good price,"I like it - it's quiet, easy to use, a snap to set up the quick-keys.  And you can't beat the price.  I'm on it all day and I find it easy and pleasant to use"
electronics,,5.0,Positive comment about canon ink tanks,"Great product. It is always better to buy the original canon ink tanks because I have try other brands and it not the same. I highly recommend this product. It may cost more, but it's worth it"
electronics,31 of 31,4.0,Buy a Portable USB Flash Card Reader too.,SmartDisk FCD20 FotoChute 20 GB Portable Digital Storage Device.
electronics,,5.0,DVD Express Unit,I have lots of analog video tapes from the 80's and onwards.  This device works very well in transferring them.  The video & audio are in perfect sync.
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,"Great as always, with some quirky flaws..","You can't beat the sound quality, and video quality. The changeable menus are great too. It's a solid ""buffer"" in between Apple's legacy design and interface, and the new lines coming out soon that will surely turn people's heads. Why did they leave the charger adapted out of the package? No install CD? Apple's software updater can be annoying too. But, in summary, great sound quality, and hell... it's an ipod!"
electronics,,5.0,Mine works great- some recommendations for other buyer's issues,"Well, I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $149.."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great,Great product - lights the whole keyboard - fully adjustable - works on both mac an pc platforms.  Saves arguments when others want to watch the tv with the lights off and you want to surf the net
electronics,,4.0,Visor Deluxe Blue,The best at this price. Like the color and functions. Mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models. Life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized. Great optional backlight feature
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic LCD HDTV,"It was extremely easy to install; the image is absolutely beyond imagination, and as for the price, its quality ratio is at the top.  I am a loyal customer to Sony, but I have converted since!"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Lasted a Year,"Phone worked fine for a year, then would not charge the batteries. replaced batteries in both hand sets, still won't  charge reliably. weekly check battery message while sitting on the charger."
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,HDMI Digital Cable,"Excellent, perfectly clear and detailed picture on 55 inch LCD projection TV.  Great contrast, perfect sound"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Ain't Nothin' Wrong With These Things,I use these primarily to record music compilations from my CD collection... I originally intended to use them in the car during long trips.  I was very please and surprised to find that they sound teriffic on my high end stereo rig as well... giving up only the smallest amount of resolution and detail...losses that only an audio nut like myself would detect.   
electronics,1 of 13,1.0,TERRIBLE,STILL HAVENT FIGURED OUT HOW TO SET IT UP WITH MY SURROUND SOUND/CABLE SYSTEM.  HAD IT SINCE SEPTEMBER - HASNT WORKED 1 DAY... HAD 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE TRY TO GET IT TO WORK
electronics,,5.0,Great product,User friendly. Loading was very easy and product runs fast with no interruption. Very pleased
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Better than a desktop,"Works for me, via wireless and printer. Like the swivel feature too. Best price on net including the folks who overbid it on ebay"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,iMic 2 is a necessity for recording,"I record a lot of vocals directly into my pc, and I thought that the iMic 2 may cancel out a significant amount of distortion since it connects to USB instead through the sound card.  I was right and wrong, if you try recording into your pc with the iMic set to mic level input, recording will still sound very distorted. But if you have it set to line level input practically all distortion is wiped out.  I am very pleased with how the iMic performs at such a low price.  Out put is pretty weak though"
electronics,9 of 10,4.0,The Volvo of the Palm line,"With none of the Plasticky goodness of the Z-22, or the 'Mobile Chernobyl' power of the Lifedrive, the E2  is an excellent mid-range buy. I was looking for my first PDA to keep me organized as I re-entered the job market, and (eventually) got the E2. From the moment it came out of the box, my E2 has kept me happy- the bright, crisp screen, easy to use controls, good looks and practical software bundle. Information is password protected, and the layout is easy to follow. Many moan and groan over Graffiti 2,which turns movements of the stylus into typed script, but I just use the on-screen keyboard, and do just fine. the battery keeps going for several days, even with constant use. Some things to remember:"
electronics,2 of 6,5.0,Great Buy!,The best brand name in home audio/visual cable accessories. This was the best price I found this quality
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Bose Quiet Comfort 2,"It was well worth the money spent.  The quality, quietness and comfort of the Bose QuietComfort head phone are amazing.  It is one of the best purchases that I have ever made."
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Avoid Samsung Like The Plague,"I bought this heap of crap and a Samsung TV both have failed after a year..and while they worked for the first 12 months there was always some little glitch or irritating thing that would arise...finally it gets to the point where remote is weak with new batteries installed,it DOES not play most dvd's after a year, and the TV I boight from these schmucks, just went yesterday. SAMSUNG....go back to KOREA"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great product,"I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,1-2-3 Easy,"I got a Dell Dimension 2400 for Valentine's Day and it didn't come with any firewire ports for my ipod. So I asked my Dad what he used, and he told me about this handy little card. I have XP, so maybe that's the difference maker, but this card was SO easy to work with... seriously, having never seen the inside of a computer before, I installed it in 5 minutes while I was talking on the phone with my girlfriend. After that, a simple reboot and I had three firewire ports ready for use! Highly recommended for XP users"
electronics,24 of 25,4.0,Excellent buy! ,"I was looking for a scanner that could digitize pages larger (in length) that standard letter size (8,5x11 inches). In my country (Chile) nobody now sells legal size scanners (or almost scanners at all - they have all moved to multifunctional devices). When shopping at Amazon for this specific figure, I found this very new product (even in the Fujitsu page it is quite new). I wondered if it would work for my needs."
electronics,,4.0,"Stable, but for the S-video","I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Only mpeg capture device I have tried that gives a good quality picture.  Any other device I tried only worked converting to avi's, if at all.   Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  If I use S-video instead of composite video, computer locks up (but that may be a problem on my end).  There are 2 different capture methods (Capwiz and Ulead's Video Studio).  Sound was a bit behind using Capwiz, use VS instead.  Would be nice to be able to set bitrate rather than be stuck with variable, but now I am just nitpicking"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Great SD card and great USB memory, Two in one!!","I bought this card because I don't like bulky USB flash memories, I carry it on my wallet!! It looks delicate but with good care and keeping it between a couple credit cards it's been great for a couple months. Also the writing and reading speeds are great"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great player - Even Better Rebate,"(...).  This is a great player for a first-time MP3 player buyer.  The software was easy to operate and transfer music, once I realized I needed to push the USB cord into the player a little further than I had it.  That cord is kind of touchy.  Once it makes a connection you have to leave it alone or it will disconnect.  Other than that, I've had no problems what so ever with hardware or software."
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,"Multiple problems, Poor customer service","I bought this phone and two additional handsets in August, 2006. I was immediately unimpressed with the signal quality--crackling static on the line, and an intermittent odd clicking noise on two of the handsets. After putting in a line filter, and exchanging one of the handsets, the problem is still only partially resolved--line crackling is still always present, but reduced. The clicking noise remains on only one handset."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Hard to get past the glare,"I like to take care of my stuff.  So, when I got a shiny new eTrex Legend, I went looking for a case for it post-haste.  This case came in at a reasonable dollar amount and seemed to be reviewed fairly well.  However, in retrospect, I should have paid greater attention to the warnings about the glare off the plastic screen cover."
electronics,34 of 37,5.0,This is the HDMI cable that you ever need,"Don't spend your money on the brand name cables.  They all the same as far as delivering digital contents.  Connect between my Sony DVD and Toshiba TV.  Whoala, awesome picture"
electronics,,1.0,Cannot Recommend This Product,"This product is advertised as ""Wireless Headphones for iPod""..."
electronics,6 of 10,5.0,Great deal,"You'll have to search pretty hard to find a better deal than this.  I should know, cuz I did, and wound up picking up these bad boys.  Basically, a great quality miniDV tape, at a heavily discounted price, and FREE SHIPPING......Can't go wrong with that combo!!"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Awesome!!!,"I bought this product because, as it stated on the side of the box, it was MAC ready. Well it wasn't. So I jumped over to Windows on my wonderful little Intel Powerbook and I have to say that the software that came with this device was the first decent piece of code I have seen on the Windows side in a LONG time! Setup was as simple as could be and the picture was great."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good Deal,"It works fine... I`ve been having a little bit of problems for it to catch a station, but once it does, it works fine, with a bit of interference every now and then, but overall, it`s a good deal... Besides, it`s way cheaper than the ones sold in stores"
electronics,7 of 27,4.0,a very good product,"i bought this product on augest 21,2005 and then i got this product today augest 24,2005 the sad part is i got this befor i got my ipod mini and i ordered my ipod befor i ordered this charger but there is a shipping fee of 7.95 but its worth it cause i got a free gift i got a cell signal boster for free and i got this product in just 3 days on standered shipping but a very very good product if you have a ipod then you should get this and the shipping is the best :)  :"
electronics,11 of 17,5.0,very cool,"I just got my Globalpetfinder. I can't believe how light it is. It looked bigger in the picture. I am happy to report that my dog doesn't even notice that it is on her.  cool product, Love i"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Very Pleased,It arrived in plenty of time.  It has been very efficient!  No problems.....would do again
electronics,,5.0,Great bang for the buck!,"Love this phone.  It is everything it promises to be.  The only small thing that could use some improvement is the speaker quality, but not a big deal.  Great technology overall and highly recommended"
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,Revolutionary golf product - A MUST HAVE!!!!!,"I have owned this product for over a year and find it to be the best thing I take with me to the course.  If you will spend 15 minutes reading the well written user's guide and follow what it says, I promise it will be the most enjoyable and useful product you will use.  Accurate to within one yard with instantaneous readings, it will improve your play by providing you with accurate distances and allow you to select your shots by knowing distances to various key locations on each hole.  Not only does it allow you to pinpoint flag locations to within one yard on each hole, but of equal importance it provides you with yardage information on distances to sand traps, water and any other point you so choose.  It also allows you to track the distances of each shot to build a profile of your yardages for each club hit.  I can't imagine playing without it.  And for only $349, I would definitely purchase this powerful tool before I would spend my money on a more expensive driver or set of clubs.  I am a strong supporter of this product.  What an advantage you have over others in your foursome"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works with Dell Axim X5!,I opened the box.  I read the quick installation guide.
electronics,,2.0,Works well but is badly made,"I bought this at the end of Feb. 2006 for my Mac. It works well except for the fact that the device is poorly designed. The part where the USB connector is and where the device bends doesn't take the stresses of normal use well and keeps popping open. For a while I put it back together, but this last time it tore out four of the five wires that connect the USB to the rest of the device and it is kaput. The wires are thin and soldered on lightly. It is not a robust hardware design. That is too bad because except for that (serious) problem, the device worked well with iTunes, the DVD player and other software. I wrote to the tech support people at Griffin Technology and told them that they need to replace it because it broke under normal wear and tear. We'll see what happens. I will report back. But if you purchase this, be very very careful and treat it very very gently."
electronics,3 of 6,1.0,Not good,I bought this item thinking that it will be a good one for a good price. Head makes a lot of sound and dvd stucks a lot during. I have returned this item
electronics,,1.0,Bad product,"1. My head is not as big as Neal Cuveto, but the plastic arm broke after 1 week of wearing."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellant shipping time and a great value for this product!,Price was awesome and shipping was FREE! I could have spent a $100.00 or more for this same item and I was able to purchase it for $40.00! The movement and durability of this item is everything I expected and more
electronics,,1.0,Doesn't work,"I purchased this PNY 1G SD card from BestBuy and it it didn't work right from the get go.  My iPAQ wouldn't recognize the card and the  card reader in my laptop would recognize the card, assign it a drive letter, but would not let me access it or format it for use.  I eventually returned it to the store and bought another brand.  On another note, PNY's web page was of no help and their customer service department doesn't return calls.  My advice is don't waste your time with this card"
electronics,7 of 9,1.0,Terrible Headset,"I bought this headset recently and was amazingly disappointed with it almost immediately. Other than a stylish design, this headset has no upside. The sound quality is terrible, even for the price. The mic is worthless; in all my attempts to use it in gaming(what this headset was purportedly designed for) failed utterly. People were unable to make out my voice at all. Don't waste your time buying this trash, you'll just have to return it and replace it within days"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,absolutly capital,the one gig sd card works better than i thougt it would. it is by far the cheapest one i've ever found and i'll probably get another one soon.
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Comment on external haard drive,This is a great product to have in case your pc crashed. It will save you time and a lots of money. I just bought a new pc and I want to protect it  from any unforseen events.
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Perfect!,"This item is perfect! It's so simple and easy to use. I have an HP media pc, so it fits pefectly into the Drive Bay but its also perfect for use with other pcs. The drive acts just like a normal window would in Microsoft Windows (drag&drop style). "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Sony Headphone Review,The headphone was lightweight. Easy to keep on your head. The sound was very stero phonic for such a small piece of equipment. You don't have to turn up the sound a lot to hear the radio. It's quite powerful in volume.It's good for walking or jogging.
electronics,1 of 4,4.0,your device may not really be HDMI ready,"I bought the HDMI cable to connect Vip211 HD satelite receiver and Philips LCD HDTV. At first it had picture but no sound. After live unplug/plug, I got sound. Turn off TV then turn on sometime later, TV does not even know the receiver. Searching internet forum, I found a lot of complaints on Vip211 receiver over the last 6 months. Seems devices always talk over analog link, but often not talk over digital link. 6 months is not long enough for a manufacturer to fix HDMI interface problem. I'd suggest wait if you can, since HDMI is not mature enough"
electronics,,4.0,Better Than a Cat,"Does It's job, might be a bit over priced, but saves drilling holes through floors and walls or having cables on the floor. Worth it to me"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"""Very OK"" closed portable headphone","I haven't had any difficulty obtaining a seal with the Sennheiser PX 200W, and it provides sufficient isolation to be usable on the subway. This headphone has a nice midrange, producing vocals that sound quite natural, but the treble is severely rolled off above 10 KHz and there's a pronounced midbass hump, resulting in a overall sound that, while pleasant enough for casual, portable listening, isn't at all refined or ""high end"" in character"
electronics,,5.0,very easy and safe,"always work, very easy to swift, fast and usb bus powered. I feel much safer with this drive. Nomore stress about ""sharing"" any data or forgetting a complicated password. LOVE IT"
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,"DOES NOT Integrate well with skype, messes your PC Audio Controls","Though cheap, this phone does not integrate well with skype, some of the buttons on the phone like the 'in', 'out', and 'del' do not have any or the wrong effect on skype software. Also the drivers messed up my laptop's audio quickset controls, which did not happen with my cyberphone W which I got from the skype websit"

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Pleased with results,"This is my first webcam experience and I have been very pleased.  I've owned it for a little over a week and have used it quite a bit so far.  Everyone on the receiving end of my Skype calls have been very impressed with the quality of the video and sound (I use the integrated microphone, not a headset).  "
electronics,4 of 21,1.0,i wish i could give these zero stars,"i'm doing a project and i tested these batteries. it is pathetic, the lasted for 104 min.! then they ran out! can you believe it? i definitly will never buy these batteries, but they're extremely cheap"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Best computer accessory I have ever purchased,"This printer is by far is the best computer accessory I've ever bought for myself. An avid picture taker, I am more than pleased with the quality of the photos this printer produces. On top of that, it's compact size makes it's easy to take along when I go out of town. "
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Etymotic Earphones,"These are great earphones. I have both the ER4 and ER6I, both sound great but I prefer the ER6i because the ER4 has a stiffer wire that tends to be microphonic. In a side-by-side comparison they sound very similar to me. But I'm not an audiophile."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,"Panasonic  2,4 GHz  KX-TG2620","I bought my first unit at Best Buy. I've used it for a couple of months now. I find it to be the BEST single-unit telephone that I've ever purchased. It's easy, comfortable, has great sound, and is well featured. I highly recommend this product. (I am in the process of ordering two more from Amazon)"

electronics,17 of 18,5.0,Best Picture Award!,This flat screen 36&quot; Sony TV gets our vote for the &quot;Best Picture Award&quot; out of all the TV'S we have looked at during the last month. We had a chance to compare with over a dozen other makes and models in the 32&quot; and 36&quot; class at our local Sears Store. These included several top name brands. All had the same feed and were tuned to the same channel. The 32&quot; and 36&quot; Sony Triniton's outshined by far all of the other competition in picture sharpness and clarity.! It's a very nice looking TV and the stereo sound quality is excellent also
electronics,,1.0,POS!  Broke w/in 6 months and Apple bailed on it.,"What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks"

electronics,1 of 5,1.0,Absolute Junk,"This was by far the worse purchase ever it didn't even work out of the box, and the construction is so flimsy, it's pathetic.  Oh and fyi the instructions are so vague, goodluck understanding em.  I think my 6 yr old niece could have done a better job writing the instructions.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of junk at all costs.  Buy a nostramos n52 pad not as many buttons, but much much better over all"
electronics,,5.0,Rugged and easy on the back!,"I carry a big heavy Dell Precision 17"" Notebook in this backpack.  I like it because the weight stays tight to the back and the pack fills evenly, without creating a bulky overhang that is an obstacle to navigating through hallways.  The width provides the extra space you need and the construction is durable. The handle in the top isn't an add-on -- its carefully worked into the saddlebag design and doesn't pinch your fingers when you carry it this way.  The saddlebag design just seems to distribute the weight more evenly, making this the most comfortable backback I've owned.  I'd buy it again!"
electronics,,5.0,In a fix?  Get it!,"Too many times my kids have forgotten to plug in their ipods for updating/recharging.  Although you can't update, you can use this car charger and still play the tunes.  It has been great as a stop-gap"
electronics,26 of 27,1.0,Buyer beware,I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product. 
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,does not work with dishnetwork superdish,Beware.  This antenna's built in clips are not compatible with the metal oval superdish.
electronics,0 of 3,4.0,Cord Accessory FYI,"I don't own an iPod, but I'm considering buying one, so I'm doing some research.  I came across an iPod cord management device that might be of interest (based on the reviews of this product and complaints of excess cord with this product).  It is the Belkin ""TuneTie for iPod.""  You can find it on Belkin's website (I'd post the URL, but that's prohibited)"
electronics,,4.0,from a workaholic's wife,I bought it as a present for my husband. He complied everyday about he needed a lap table to work extra hours in the bed. He really appreciates the gift. However it would be useful to include some sticks to place the table on the bed instead of the lap. Sometimes the lap heats too much and feels uncomfortable. With the sticks the table would be a little bit higher and the air will pass though it. Great value

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Phone as described,"The heavy base ensures that it is unlikely to be dislodged while talking on the handset.  All the functions are on the handset, which is well lit, and they more than serve the purpose for a basic phone.  I'm very satisfied with my purchases (I bought two at the same time based on the description provided with the phone)"
electronics,,4.0,Great deal,"Works great, love it. But, two issues I think should be fixed. As others have mentioned, the belt clip is useless. It completely doesn't clip to anything. If you don't have a pocket to put it in, you'll have to hold it. "
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,I like it!,"I owned this USB memory stick for a couple months now. I have no problems with it at all. The U3 feature is really cool, seems like it has its own operating system for the USB to run programs and to manage the usb drive and the file contents. No USB cap to worry about, cause its cap less! I give it a A++"
electronics,,5.0,Hands down the best.,"I decided to read through all the reviews first and see what everyone else had to say.  Looking at most of the negative ones I notices most just seemed to have one or two things in common.  Ergonomics and Drivers.  I've been using this style of mouse for about 8-9 years now.  I have an earlier version of this mouse that has been working for about that long and I have purchased the same one since for the other two computers I have.  I have never had a problem of ergonomically ""incorrect"" with these mice.  Being in animation, I do a lot moving and placing of objects in the programs I use.  This mouse makes doing that a whole heck of a lot easier.  I am also a gamer that will end up playing on-line games for hours at a time too.  Just being able to rest my hand upon it and not have to worry about moving it all around a pad is good too."
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This telephone is an absolute piece of garbage.  I tried one and it had unacceptable line noise and very poor voice quality.  I exchanged it for another one, and it had the same problems.  I called Plantronics tech suppport, and after very long hold times got representatives who were totally clueless.  I will NEVER buy a Plantronics product again.  This item should be taken off the market."

electronics,6 of 6,4.0,"Works great, with some minor flaws",Purchased this to protect my Garmin 60CSx and it works great.  A snug fit and it is a nice second skin to an already rugged device.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great :) ,i love these speakers they are perfect for my huge computer desk there was nothing there before and now it looks awesome with my pc.  the sub is the best ever i can shake my entire house with it (my house is pretty big) and the stands for the sattelites are very sturdy despite what others have said.  it is very simple setup and goes great with any type of theme that you have going on with your computer the only thing wrong with it is that i dont have a sound card for it so i cant get the full surrond sound right now but i reccomend this to anyone who is a big gamer or loves loud music.  when you live in the middle of nowhere you can rock all night long
electronics,,4.0,"Tight keys, but works well","Generally good product if you are looking for something to carry.  Bluetooth works well, but you may have to download instructions on how to install from the internet.  I used it with my Macbook and everything worked.  However, the keys are small, and you have to press the function key to get access to certain characters (a little annoying).  Over all, a good product for quick use when not at home.  However, for long term use, invest in a full sized keyboard"
electronics,7 of 13,5.0,Wait for Newest iPod,"Think about it: Maybe you should wait for the newset iPod, which should be coming out around Christmas, instead of getting stuck with this iPod and realizing that there is a new one coming out. Just a thought"
electronics,,5.0,wonderful,"a great mouse! perfect size, nice features. Simply plug it in and it starts working! Seems to be well made. To install the battery you have to push in the silver logo button on the back end of the mouse really hard. Then the casing top pops off."

But overall very happy with it and would recommend it to others (and have)"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great product,This was a wonderful idea for a Father's Day Present.  Dad never saw it coming.  I wish someone thought about getting me one for Father's Day seeing as I lost my Apple Ipod Nano after having it for 2 weeks.  Did some shopping around after found some better deals with more storage space but definately sufficient for the cause

electronics,,1.0,Don't get this one!,"If you are buying a portable DVD player, don't get this one.  It stopped working within 1 month of getting it.  The motor for the spinner stopped working, and it would not even recognize that I put a DVD in.  Also, even before that, it wouldn't play many of my DVD's.  It behaved as if they were all scratched up, even brand new ones.  All of my DVDs play just fine on any other DVD player.  Plus, I had a brand new DVD that I tried to play on it (first time watching it), and it scratched up part of it so bad, that I can't watch the last 15 minutes on any DVD player."
electronics,13 of 15,4.0,On the Contract,"Just wanted to note that the contract is available at the top of this page. If you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I have no idea how true they are to their contract, but I read the service plan intensely since I nearly got it."
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,EXCELLENT FOR GAMERS,"I agree that these cards are very pricey.  The sound in games and music, however, is amazing. The ""crystallizer"" feature (included in the whole x-fi line) creates an amazing surround effect for gaming and music, especially for headphones.  I purchased this card because I must play through headphones.  I only went with the fatal1ty card because it was on sale as a preorder.  Otherwise, I would have purchased the platinum because I am unsure if developers will actually utilize the onboard ram this card comes with.  The presence of the ram doesn't effect the sound, it only theoretically offloads the CPU.  If you have the means and play through headphones, I highly recommend this card.   "
electronics,,4.0,Excellent purchase ...,"The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent wireless desktop and mouse,Dependable.  Long battery life.  Good ergonomic feel to the mouse and keyboard.  Lots of shortcut keys.  No wires:
electronics,8 of 9,1.0,Klipsch Customer Service Is As Lousy As It's Product,"I purchased a set of 2.1 Pro Media speakers from the vaunted Klipsch between 6-7 months ago. I bought them at an Apple Store, which was my first mistake because the store is 60 miles from me."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Great headphones,"NOTE: These headphones are in every way the same as the MDR-7506's, well-loved headphones for studio work.  Even the replacement part #'s are exactly the same.  So this review is for either one (I bought both)."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Sennheiser USB PC155 Headset,"Very well designed with good comfort level when used over extended periods of time. The sound quality is excellent and there is no set-up required as it uses a USB connection. However, I am disappointed with the build quality - the cushion at the top of the headset is not properly attached and the adhesive keeps peeling back"
electronics,,4.0,It's cool,This item is very useful for my car because it doesn't have any unocuppied space near to the cigarette lighter socket.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great radio!,At this price they don't get any better.  I bought a Radio Shack radio for about the same price and returned it.  It was worth maybe $15 or $20. The sound is extremely good for its size.
electronics,5 of 27,2.0,Seasickness while writing,"I am a serious tablet user as I have a Motion Computing 1400 Tablet PC Slate (Great computer).  I use the program ""Journal Notes"" for meeting minutes.  What makes Journal Notes so useful is that you can lasso or select handwritten notes and move them to where you want on the page.  This allows one to keep their notes neat and then ready to print right after the meeting rather than going back to your desk and spending another hour translating all the side scribble.  So I thought by buying a Wacom Tablet this would help turn some of our laptops into tablets.  "
electronics,,4.0,Great Little Speakers,"I really like this set of speakers, and they are a great value for the money. I tried to do lots of research and comparisons before I finally decided to buy these, and I'm glad I did. I bought them to put in my home office (and I sometimes put them in the bathroom to sing along with music while I'm in the shower). They work really well in small spaces like these, and they're extremely easy to move around, especially since they don't have to be near an outlet. The maximum volume with my iPod Shuffle doesn't sound distorted, although obviously it's not the crystal clear sound you'd get from a larger pair of powered speakers. Overall, I'm very happy, and I'd buy them again"
electronics,0 of 6,2.0,Go with the Sony or other brands,"I end up returning these due to the fact that it's very uncomfortable inside your ears, and the sound quality is no better than my Ipod original earphones."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Does what it says,It works just like it says.  I was looking for a wifi card to replace one I broke and got a great deal on this one.  So far it seems to be a good product
electronics,5 of 9,2.0,Almost Perfect,"I loved this set the first two months I had it. It's so much easier to type on the laptop style keyboards, and the media pad was unexpectedly versatile. The mouse fits your hand perfectly, and the battery lasts forever. However...."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Great little device,"Great for planes or when you just need more juice!  Works with my iPod Mini super well, especially since the iPod is kinda junky and doesn't hold a charge anymore (thanks Apple)"
electronics,,2.0,How disappointing!,ok when I first got these speakers I would have given them at least 4 stars.  Good sound for the money.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Insane Quality at a price that will make you think twice,"When I saw these headphones online, they looked great, I bought them so quick because of the great price. That was more then a year ago, these things are amazing. Insane quality, the bass is massive and strong, and every thing sounds extremely crisp and clear, with exceptional highs and lows. The headphones completely cover your ears, engulfing your head in sound, blocking most all of background sounds. The only thing I don't like is the cord, the twisted bungy cord is annoying if it stretches, because it tends to pull down on your head a bit. Nothing an extention cord can't fix though, which is what I use with it. I highly recommend these headphones for the computer, movies, or any thing else. A bit big to be bring around with your MP3 player though."
electronics,1 of 5,5.0,Adds Memory to Embroidery Machine,My Janome Memory Craft 300E Embroidery Machine needed a Compact Flash Card Adapter to use in the machine's card slot.  The manufacturer recommended a Sandisk Adapter for use with the Sandisk FlashCard.  The first place I look for needed items is Amazon.  Found what I needed - the price was right & the service was fast.  Thanks!
electronics,28 of 28,5.0,Excellent video webcam,"I looked for a long time for a remote camera to keep an eye on a vacation residence.  Reviews of other similar cameras like the Toshiba IK-WB11A were spotty at best especially when using in wireless mode.  Panasonic cameras seemed to get good reliability reviews, so when an outdoor wireless-G came out I decided to give it a try.  I had some difficulty getting the ports forwarded through my router.  The directions are pretty sparse when it comes to setting up your router.  I guess there is a fair variability in how each different router is set up.  Once that problem was solved it has been rock solid.  In the 4 months I have had it running, I only had to reset it once, after a 3 day power failure.  Actually, I think it was the router, not the camera that needed to be reset, but I reset everything.  It does everything it is advertised to do although I don't use the audio feature.  The motion detection feature works better than other webcam security software that I have tried"
electronics,,4.0,"Touchy wheel button, otherwise good mouse","I used one of these mice at work for a few years and it was a sturdy and reliable performer.  When the mouse that came with my computer bit the dust after only four months' use, I didn't hesitate to buy another one for home.  I do have a complaint with this one, however:  The wheel button is too easily clicked, making scrolling with the wheel challenging.  I'm learning to use a light touch on the scroll wheel"
electronics,4 of 8,2.0,Vonage VS this product,I just want to say I've have had Vonage for more then two years and had my phone number transferred to them. My Vonage service has been excellent with very few problems.
electronics,,5.0,Fuji 1GB xD Picture card,This card seems to give the same excellent photos as my other Fuji cards. Love the huge number of photos I can take. Very handy when traveling outside the US with no access to back up
electronics,,4.0,"Works good, but ""freeze's""","I am satisfied with this product to a certain point.  I works good, but it will ""freeze"" and it will have to be reset. This happens rather often, other than that though, no complaints"
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,"Wrong Item Described, Will Not Work With This Unit","Item was wrongly described by amazon, will not fit unit that I purchased it for at the same time. Unable to find correct one on amazon."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Panasonic GigaRange KX-TG5566M Phone and  KX-TGA552M Handset,"Finally a phone and handset that is almost perfect.  You don't have to read or listen to the ""mushed"" caller ID voice to identify when you want to answer the phone. You have many alternate choices... ring tones, pictures that pop up, and/or the blinking message light color.  There are some weaknesses compared to the many other phones I have owned: 1) You can't customize the caller ID voice for your friends (but as mentioned above, you don't need this feature), 2) You can't dial from the speaker base without removing the handset first (what were the designers thinking?), 3) When you answer a call on one handset, the other handsets report the call as a missed call (just give up cleaning out the missed calls on the other handsets).  4) The buttons are a small on the handsets.  However, it's the best phone I've owned so far. What I'd like to have is the ability to load all the features from the PC based phonebook.  You can't customize the ring tone, ring color, and picture pop up from the PC based phone book so when you load the individual sets, you do more than put the name and number in the phonebook. You spend a lot of time customizing all the handsets. I do like the fact that you can add a name and number on one handset and send it (or all of names) to the other phone sets (... only one handset at at time).   It's a definite keeper once you get past spending a lot of time programming the custom features.  I recommend that you buy extra handsets and get down to one 5.8 Ghz phoneset system.  I had two different 5.8 GHz phones interfering with each other.  Now these phones work everywhere in my house. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Sennheiser CX300-B vs Sony MDX Earbuds ,"I've been using the Sony MDX earbuds for about 3 years now. The primary use is with a San Disk MP3. Used this system for jogging and motorcycle riding. Until purchasing the Sennheiser's I thought the sound with the Sony's was ok. However, the Sony's wires are soft-coated and after a wind beating by riding the motorcycle, the coating desenigrated, leaving bare wires. I went through two pairs of the MDX and decided to try something else. Enter the Sennheiser's. Wow... what a difference in sound quality. These little babies have great base and more importantly, separation.. yes, I know this is the MP3, but, I never got it with the Sony's. Very happy with the Sennheiser CX300's... will buy a pair for my wife"
electronics,,1.0,Overhyped,"I do not understand how this product contiues to get such great reviews.  I fly small general aviation aircraft and these rudder pedals do not even come close to the real thing.  The pedals have no feel to them and they do not have any method of adjusting the resistance.  I had to adjust them so that their response was not linear just so they would operate in a reasonable fashion.  I do not know if its the pedals or the flight model for the Cessna 172 in both Fs9 and Fs 10, but I am unable to perform a adequate forward or side slip. I've tried adjusting them, and that does seem to help some, but my biggest complaint is that they have not resistance to them. "
electronics,,5.0,"High speed, reliable and lots of storgae",I purchased this card to go with my Canon DSLR. Initially was worried about the speed of transfer from camera to this card & then from card to desktop. My concerns were unfounded
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Good buy,Customer reviews helped me make this my choice for sending a new TV to my Dad.  He was thrilled with the quality of the picture -extremely clear- and good colors.   The integrated DVD player and Video are a big plus too.  Delivery was extremely fast and the product arrived in good condition
electronics,,5.0,The Metal Case (Metallic Silver) - Excellent!,"I received my Armor Case today, and it arrived earlier than I had expected. It came in excellent condition, and putting it together was simple. The case is just the right size for the Cingular 8125. When you put the phone in, you'll notice you have to squeeze it in there. This pushes the foam in a little bit, and so when you have it in there, its really secured and firm. Taking it out, requires you to pull it out with a little force, which in my opinion, is good. Thats good because it'll take some force for the phone to come out, so if you drop it, its not going to roll out. Honestly, I think the little clip that keeps the case closed could have been more securely locked, but other than that, its good. Its still good, but I'm pretty sure it will open if I dropped it hard enough (which I don't plan on doing). It'll open, but the phone wouldn't come out. Anyways, great product. Definitely beats the leather case Cingular gave us, I dropped it once with that leather case, thats why I bought this one. The leather case has very little protection on the corners, where I scratched mine due to an accident :"
electronics,8 of 15,1.0,RIP-OFF: Doesn't advertise that you need an AC adaptor,"I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice"
electronics,,4.0,This Card Reader Crashes my Windows XP Pro...........,I love this card reader.  The speeds with the USB2 Are incredible!  The only gripe I have is that it keeps crashing my Windows XP Pro SP2 high end Dell computer.  
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Very good calculator,"After my HP 17bII was knocked off a counter and killed the screen I looked to replace it.  I soon found the 17bII+ and ordered from Amazon.  After reading some of the reviews I was a little concerned but mine works just fine.  It does not convey the same feel of quality as earlier HPs. It just seems lighter and less solid. The keys have good feel but don't match the feel of the many earlier HPs I have owned.  However, it gets the job done, and may last as long as the earlier models, but if you are looking for the HP ""feel"" you may be disappointed.  The case however is a great improvement over the 17bII"
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Product,"This mp3 is great, files are easy to transfer, in line recording feature is a plus and the player is small enough to no be an annoyance at the gym"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Wicked!!!," The ZBoard is the next best thing to having a voice activated keyboard that writes for you. Its great for anything you want to do. If your a gamer, get this keyboard, it has changeable keypads for all the best new games and it helps a lot! If your new or experienced this is a great keyboard. And the best part is, it works for typing as well. The ZBoard has a layout specifically . designed for typing AND searching on the web so it's good for everyone not just hardcore gamers. I love this keyboard. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Met all expectations,"Absolutely no problems in set-up or installation on my Mac (OS X) and a small home-office LAN with two ethernet printers. I have connected it to DSL modems with two different service providers recently. Works flawlessly and does exactly what it is supposed to do. Small, neat-looking device. Good buy"
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,Not enough ink,The cartridge does not hold enough ink. It prints 50 pages maximum. That equates to $.24 / page of copy. WAAAAAY to expensive.
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,D-Link DFE-530TX+ Ethernet Adapter,"Have had several in operation on XP, M.E., and 98 SE computers. Have been mostly trouble free, small problems worked out with assistance of helpfull phone staff.  User's guide is somewhat confusing, On page 17, under title &quot;Software Installation&quot; directs you to the &quot;READ ME&quot; file on root directory of installation diskette, of course there is no readme file there.  But, well, nobody's perfect"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great speakers for the price,"For $35 speakers they sound excelent. I am sure if you buy some really expensive speakers that they would sound better, but if you're looking for good sound without a hefty price tag these speakers are for you. They also have a nice look."
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,I'll never buy another Toshiba product,Bought this TV in May of 2005.  It died in early March.  The parts have been on back order since then.  If you want a nice heavy paperweight I would suggest this product
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,It does its job,"Not much to it, but it allowed me to hook up new noise cancelling headphones to the soundboard at church"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great for the price,"This is a great disc wallet.  Not too small, but not overly bulky and heavy when loaded with discs (unlike the larger models).  The only problem I have with it (a very minor one) is that when it is turned upside down, in handling, the discs in the lower pouches can slide out and be loose when you unzip and open it.  Still a great deal"
electronics,,5.0,The cutting edge in gaming.,"I'm consistently on the top of the list for kills in counter-strike source, the quick buttons for mouse sensitivity make it so much easier to switch to lower levels for regular computing needs, and high levels for gaming capabilities. I highly recommend this mouse to anyone who plays first person shooters"
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Reciever disks have been battery burners,I have the older 4 reciever unit. The concept is great. It works well when the batteries in the recievers aren't dead. I've had mine two years and the batteries in the receivers with no use seem to go dead in two months. It's the same for all 4 receivers. They go dead at about the same time. Stock up on the CR2032 quarter sized batteries
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,RCO 6way Remote,"Im with the first reviewer. This unit will operate only some of the functions of each device. For ex: it wont switch my Toshiba TV's video input, this means you cant use this to switch between the cable/tv/dvd/HDTV inputs. On the cable box it wont show the guide, info or setup screens. This perplexes me and yes I tried EVERY code to see if it would work."
electronics,1 of 87,5.0,very necessary (must have),I like to protect my items so i always purchase an extra warrenty

electronics,5 of 6,5.0,works with suse linux,"i am running suse 9.3 on an older sony desktop that has a pcmcia slot. i was using an older 802.11b card but wanted to upgrade to WPA-PSK so started looking for a G card that would work with suse. searching the internet i found that cards with the atheros chipset are supported without use of third party ""wrappers"" and windows drivers. i inserted the card and went to YaST configuration and the card was recognized! i turned MAC address filtering and encryption off in my router. this eliminates 2 variables and makes getting set up easier. after i made sure i was connecting to the internet i turned MAC filtering and encryption on. so far no problems. the card gets great reception. my router is an smc barricade G. i have a motorola usb wireless access point hooked to an old hp desktop and my mac mini using airport extreme wireless. all work great together"
electronics,,5.0,Great keyboard at a little price,"IF you are a typist - this is a great keyboard.  The ergonomic design is so kind to your hands, once you get used to it.  I used one at work for a few years and when I retired, had a hard time getting used to our expensive ""regular"" keyboard.  So, I couldn't wait to find this Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite and couldn't believe how inexpensive it was.  My husband who types with two fingers, is also finally getting used to it!  I love it and it certainly is kind to my wrists and fingers"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,fleecing loyal apple buyers,"The first thing I did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually WAS an Apple product.  Its REALLY cheap looking.  Looks like something you'd find for [...] at a flea market or in the ""stocking stuffers"" section of the dollar store at Christmas time. The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Performs as advertised...But,"Everything is OK except for one overlooked feature. When you turn it off, it turns off unamplified sound also. A bypass feature would be more convenient. That way if could be left in place when amplification is not needed"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Quality at a Great Price!,"I love this kit! It sounds oh-so-good! I especially love the fact that you can change the adapter plug on the casette adapter from front-loading to side-loading. Very convenient! I also like all of the voltage adapters, I have used it to charge my cell phone as well as operate my CD player. "
electronics,,5.0,Great!,"I love this product... It was incredibly easy to set up, and I use it ALL the time. My sister is in London right now, and I tape shows on my DVR for her to watch, And she watches them on her laptop in London. It's a really fantastic product"
electronics,,2.0,mechanism so loud you can hear it over the film,"I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon.  It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections.  the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,"Fast, and well-equipped!","This is my very first USB flash drive.  I've used others before, but never owned my own.  I decided to go for the 1GB version, so I'd have plenty of room to put whatever I wanted onto it."
electronics,0 of 5,4.0,credit acct,I had a good experience except for the credit that was promised for the opening of the Amazon Acct does not get confirmed in the initial process anywhere so I'm in limbo until I get the billing and hopeit is there. It also showed 2 different amounts in 2 different places. One on the initial page the other on a succeeding page. One was $30 the other $40.  Bill Stephens  
electronics,,4.0,Works fine for all electronics goods,Its really works fine for my items as well as my son's toys. We both  are happy with this
electronics,14 of 14,1.0,Garbage,"I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.  Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room.  The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing.  It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand.  The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live.  This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash.  I won't miss it at all"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,apple stands behind their product,"I purchased the shuffle and sports case for my 4 year old son from Amazon for Christmas.  The case does a good job of protecting the shuffle from scratches and dirt (and bugs, my son says).  The sports case comes with a lanyard and a 4 inch headphone extension cable to permit use of other headphones whose connector might not be long enough to reach the shuffle within the case.  After a month of heavy use, the inside of one end of the headphone extension cable cracked so we could no longer attach his headphones to the shuffle while using the sports case.  I searched the internet, but could not find a place to purchase a replacement cable.  I was thinking I'd have to buy a whole new sports case just to get another cable.  I called Apple Care yesterday afternoon (1-800-275-2273) and by this morning I had received a replacement headphone extension cable free of charge (since the case was still under warranty).  It took about 45 minutes of talking to the phone rep to identify the exact part I was talking about (FYI, it's a do-it-yourself-part-request; the part is called ""sport case audio cable"").  The rep was friendly and willing to help me.  I am very impressed with Apple's response.  The sports case was well worth the money"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Excellant product,This is wonderful product for my laptop and I use it on daily basis.  The viewers feel happy to see the picture quality and I immediately recommend this product to them without slightest hesitation
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Buy this or any other TI or Sharp over the HP 12C,"Why does the CFA exam require this calculator?  Probably because in order to use the HP 12C properly you need to bring the manual with you.  If you don't have the manual with you at all times when using the 12C you can get the wrong answer.  Take the example in T. Hope's review, but try calculating using n= a payment with a decimal place, such as 24.5.  Then try the same thing on an HP 12C.  Oops, you don't get the same answer.  That is because the HP12C doesn't allow you to enter payment terms with decimal places in the normal manner, even though it looks like you can.  You need the manual to do it correctly.  The real problem is that you don't even know when you need the manual.  If you enter 24.5 the same way as 24 on the HP 12C, you won't get the right answer.  Any TI or Sharp financial calculator however will give you the right answer.  What other surprises are in store for those who use the 12C"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Nice Card,"I bought this card for my digital camera and I have had it for a while now.  I have not had any problems with it, it was fairly cheap, and the speed seems to be fine.  I reccomend it for anything except recording full 640x480 video at 30 FPS, because since this isn't a high speed card, when I tried to record at that quality and resolution, I only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow.  Other than that, I like this card and reccomend i"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Reliable product,These DVDs are affordably priced and reliable. I have had to discard very few so far for burn malfunctions
electronics,10 of 13,1.0,Never received product.,Waited two weeks after paying for expedited shipment and never received splitter or email from vendor.  If you want a splitter in your lifetime - do not order from this vendor
electronics,,5.0,Easy to install and use.,"Easy to install and use, still have used it only for a short time"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,JBL Creature 2,Very nice. The Al color perfectly matches with my Powerbook.  The power is great..
electronics,,4.0,Great cordless phone ,It's a great cordless phone...value for money. It has very good voice clarity & is feature rich.
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,Good for road trip travelers,"For a fully charged iPod Video (30G), it can download approximate 768MB (256MB and 512MB CF card) photos from a Canon Rebel XT Camera in about half an hour. After that, the remain power is about 5%. "
electronics,38 of 39,4.0,Next best thing to High Def!,"This TV is just amazing. My decision was narrowed to a few choices because of the 30"" space limitation in my cabinet. I was happy to find this unit measured in at less than 29"", about 1/2"" less than the published spec. So basically it was down to a JVC Le'Art 27"" and this model from Toshiba. I have to admit that I have not had good experience with Toshiba products over the last couple of years, but seeing this unit side by side with the competition it was pretty clear which one was going home with me."
electronics,,5.0,Best Boom For Your Buck,"These speakers are simply great. I can get them so loud that I can feel the bass pumping my heart for me, but they still do a great job at lower levels. With a good soundcard, you can watch DVD's in 5.1 surround sound without any hassles."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,waste of even a little money,"This product produces horrible ghosting - why they would make it, I do not know.  A total waste of money, unconscionable"
electronics,12 of 18,1.0,Price to good to be true,"I bought the HP 97 tri-color inkjet cartridge from Ace Digital Club (ADC) through the Amazon web-site, I should have known better, if the sale price is to good to be true... it is! They charged me $16.00 + change for shipping/handeling... I will not make this mistake again. "
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Fits right in,"The wireless board fits right inside the unit, so that is nice.  Takes a little to work thru the initial setup using the Canon setup utility, but once you have it paired, it works like a charm."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,D-link  DWL-G120,I read all the reviews on the D-Link DWL-G120 and there is some 
electronics,5 of 7,4.0,"excellent construction, so-so image","This is not a noisy unit, that I can tell. Ceiling-installed is completely ""invisible"" to the audience.  The only time I hear the fan is after turning the unit off."
electronics,0 of 6,1.0,very fragile headphones,"I can't review the sound quality of these earphones as they broke in my briefcase before I could use them on a LONG flight causing me to press a broken earpiece against my head in an almost comical fashion for an hour until I threw them under the seat in front of me and left them there. Ganted these are not supposed to be industructable, but they should withstand SOME everyday usage parameters. There are MUCH better choices"
electronics,,1.0,Don't waste your money on this remote,"The cable box I'm trying to control is in my bedroom.  I use an RF converter to feed the signal from that box back into rooms of the house that don't have a cable box.  But even from the room right next door, the remote won't work reliably.  Yes, there is a closet between the two rooms, so the signal has to go through two interior walls (with no plumbing or wiring within them).  But still, this is a distance of less than 18 feet."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,First DVD burn was successful!!!,I just burned my first home video DVD on the Memorex DVD+R disc.
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"Nice, solid keyboard, works with rx3115","It's hard finding a keyboard that works with your pda.  I ending up getting this one for my rx3115 and do not regret it.  Check around for prices, but this is a nice one.  I prefer the kind that hook up to the serial port and don't require batteries.  You don't have to worry about the PDA falling off or the batteries running out."
electronics,,5.0,"The Uniden EZI996: Versatile, Dependable, and Capable","I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase of the Uniden EZI996 Cordless telephone.  Having purchased my first Uniden cordless telephone in the early 1980s, I was particularly impressed by noticeable improvements in phone design, weight (heavier more solid feel) production quality, and ease of operating the phone.  The LCD screen is easily read and the volume controls make the phone user friendly for the hearing and vision impaired.  Clarity of incoming voices is sharp and not at all variable for me.  The user manual is well-written and thus, easily understood.  "
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,DO NOT Wast your time with this product...period,"I am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke.."
electronics,,5.0,"Excellent ""add on"" for charger unit","I bought these batteries along with the Sony BCG-34HE4 Super-Quick Worldwide Battery Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteries.  Exellent charger, excellent batteries.  A real money saver."
electronics,4 of 6,4.0,g-force controller is a RIPOFF!!!!!,"i got this pos for xmas 2003 thinkin it would be better than any other controller... but i was wrong. my friend let me barrow 007:nightfire and i played it and every 5 mins. I had to re-plug it because the calabration kept screwin up! and i bought 007: everything or nothing when it came out on feb 18. i brought it home thinkin how cool multi-player was going to be. but eversince i got the game i havent been able to expeirience it BECAUSE THE POS CONTROLLER WOULDNT EVEN WORK!!!!! plus it wouldnt work for MK deadly alience.... so if your planin to get a controller, say on this website... DONT GET THIS ONE! i would just get a normal one because an incodent similar to this one happened with my supper pad 64.... so do the smart thing and get a normal controller and actually ENJOY playin your games"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,The price and the product were just right,This product was exactly what I needed for my phone LG VX8100
electronics,,4.0,Good Speakers,"I just received these speakers a week ago, and they are a great set of speaker for $18, but the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the shipping, it is very expensive because their 10 lbs"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Decent sound,"Shopping around at a refurbished store, I found these on sale at $10. I bought them, because the original price is $20, so they should be pretty nice. And they are."
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Carpal Tunnel is setting in...,"Wow, I think I developed Carpal Tunnel in less than 2-days with the MX310.  Outside of that, I think with the new SetPoint software installed (over MouseWare) it's a good mouse...especially for $20.  But, mine will be going back because it is very rough on the wrist.  I've got a gel mouse pad with wrist support and I even tried the MX310 without the pad...no luck, still rough on the wrist"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Happy Father's Day iBoom unit,"From a variety of sources, one might conclude the DLO iBoom has construction issues that might make other iPod playable units more attractive. While the unit visibly appears to be plasticky, the iBoom's overall construction seems to be more than adequate to stand up to what it was designed for--simple indoor and outdoor listening pleasure."
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,More than pleased with my Garmin C340.,"My only regret about purchasing the Garmin Streetpilot C340 is that I didn't purchase it much sooner. The step by step features and the calling out of each street name when it is time to turn is exactly what I needed to get to visit some places that I am not familiar with, either in my area or out of town. The only oddity is that it will take you to the closest route, which is usually off of the freeway and I like the freeway, but Mapquest will do the exact same thing if you go to their site for instructions. I am very pleased and won't leave home without it!  "
electronics,13 of 14,4.0,Picture Perfect,"I was blown away by the picture on the Phillips PET824 portable DVD player. The LCD screen is ""liquid"" crystal clear. You lose a little definition as you move side to side (as with most LCD type screens) which only comes into play if you're trying to share the screen in really close quarters (like if three of you are trying to watch in 3 side-by-side coach fare airline seats). But if the PET824 is primarily for personal use you'll love the picture."
electronics,,5.0,Good investment,Good investment if you use canon ink to go with this paper.
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Frakking amazing.,"The positive reviews here have proven to be accurate. I've only used the Nuvi 350 for a day but this is absolute: this gadget is going to be equally as valuable to me as my iPod. It has a beautifully designed touch screen menu system, it's fast and responsive, and has been consistently accurate. There was heavy rain and cloud cover today in Manhattan but it had no problem establishing strong satellite signal connections! My Nuvi is very compact so he's definitely coming along with me on my travels"
electronics,,4.0,iPod Nano 2 GB,"Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use.  Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition.  Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good.  "
electronics,,5.0,The best headset I've used,"I have waited to fully test out this item to do my review.  I purchased this over a month ago and I am very pleased with it's performance.  The sound is clear incoming and outgoing.  I've not had one single customer say that they could not hear me.  Minor background noise is not heard by the caller.  I love having the choice of using the headband or on the ear style, they are both very comfortable.  I also like having the choice of a foam cover or the coushioned ear-piece.  This headset has performed perfectly and I would highly recommend it!!!!!"
electronics,,4.0,This is a nice set of basic computer tools.,"It's a good set at a good price made by a good company. Can I say more? Yes. The wire strippers don't look like much, but they work great."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Excellent, yet curious","The keyboard so far is great.  I've been using it for two weeks now, and only have 1 minor complaint.  If I am being lazy, slumping back in my chair with my thumb resting across the base of the keyboard, it is sometimes a little tough to 'thumb' the space bar, because of the low profile of the keys.  This issue does not bother me, because I quickly adjusted, but I thought I would point it out.  The curious part has to do with 2 keys and an apparently useless LED."
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,Excellent product,Great sound ! 
electronics,2 of 5,4.0,Good and bad of DCS-5300,"2) The cameras are not really low light and do not work well with IR emitters. I tired one brand of emitter and it was useless, I returned the emitter."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,An Executive Decision,"Lexar Compact Flash Cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals. The ""WA"" (write-acceleration) feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition. Excellent return on investment! A MUST buy. ~""O"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,wstsd Obi 1,"Oh my where to begin? Bought this product a few months ago for my ps2 and eventually xbox 360. Initially I ran the setup cd, hooked up the unit to my ps2, nothing, wouldn't work. After hours fiddling with everything from the advanced setting menu of this component to the setting menues of my wireless router. I finally got it to work. "
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Experienced GPS user finally posts a review,"First off, let me apologize for the lateness of the review.  I purchased this item in Feb 2004.  I already had owned 1 Garmin GPS, the Vista, and was looking for something a little nicer for Geocaching.  The 60C and CS hit the street with color hi-vis screens and over double the memory (Vista has 24mb) and it was a shoo-in.  Take all that along with the auto-routing feature and this product rocks.  "
electronics,3 of 5,4.0,sounds great !,very easy to install & sounds great ! great value for money.
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,How many pictures will it store?,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  "
electronics,,1.0,VCR broke after two weeks!,  My husband bought this as a 4th birthday present for our son. The vcr quit after two weeks. My husband had lost the receipt (@!&%%$%!!) and Sylvania said because we didn't have one that they could only pay for needed parts.
electronics,,4.0,Useful,Needed a large quantity of CDs for a college course; these did the job nicely
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Doesn't work,"I agree with all the bad reviews of this player. My mum bought 2, none of them work. Wrong disc, makes noise, won't play, even store bought dvd's. Very disappointing because we travellled with it for our vacation and I was looking forward to enjoying some movies. I wish I had brought the kids playstation instead"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Good for TV but maybe not music,"When my old Sennheiser corded headphones finally died (after 20+ years), I decided I would go for a cordless model this time.  I trusted Sennheiser for top-notch headphones, so I went with the RS-140."
electronics,,4.0,Great keyboard; great price,"I'm a heavy user of my keyboard and I find this USB keyboard from Kensington to be excellent. Key response is great; placement is good, and the setup extremely simple. Takes up hardly any desk space as well!"
electronics,17 of 17,5.0,Great (llow cost) UPS,"I bought 5 of these for the computers in the house. I would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all I need is about 30 seconds of power. I noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on... To my understanding this unit detects (dirty power) and when it detects it, it will then stop accepting ac power. I think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up"
electronics,,2.0,jgudnabr,"Its ok but unit wont fit in it with anny attachments,  should be larger and cushione"
electronics,3 of 6,5.0,retractable headphones rule,"I love my retractable headphones! The sound quality is really good, they're comfortable & super convienent"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works GREAT!,"It works exactly how it says, only complaint: it took a hour to get the damn packaging opened :-p, otherwise i LOVE IT!"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Outstanding sound.,This home theater system is great! It was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions. Once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear. Highly recommended for the price you pay
electronics,,5.0,Great for Graphics,This paper is a bit pricey... but it gives great results.  I use it on my Epson 740 injet printer &amp; this paper is strides ahead of the Espon paper I have tried.  I'd buy stock in this one
electronics,,5.0,Great for Running!,Ive been looking for a set that stays in my ears while running on a treadmill.. This is the set for running.. the only con about this product is that the volume is not as high as other headsets.. but i like my music loud so it could be just me.
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Great product,"This is a great! I'm very satisfied with the quality & design of the case. It can even fit my h3850 including the standard cover from compaq. Worth it, since amazon gives attractive discount"
electronics,,5.0,The best and reliable modem,I replaced my Comcast rental modem because I had problems when I connect to the router that I have. The Comcast modem always cut off the signal to the router. Since I connect the Surfboard modem I don't have problems any more. I have the Surfboard modem for more than one month already and run very smooth and reliable with my router. Good product!!
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Good (not great) set of headphones,I am a big user of my p.c. Gaming and listening to music in particular. I wanted a a pair of cordless headphones that would satisfy both interests.
electronics,16 of 16,4.0,"Nice earphones, probably wouldn't pay full price for them tho'",i was lucky enough to win of pair of these QC-3s recently. i've tried them both on two transamerica flights and iin the office.
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Just right for the more ""mature"" also.",A little different viewpoint perhaps.
electronics,,5.0,Logitech webcam - an excellent product,Our Logitech Quickcam Fusion is an excellent product.  We use it frequently with our son who also has the same webcam.  The picture and audio quality are very good.  I would highly recommend this product.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,So far so good,I really like the simplicity of this external hard drive.  I have not installed the software due to other reviews warning against it but this is doing exactly what I want it to do.  I bought it for additional storage of data as opposed to back up.  I do save lots of files to this drive and it works like a charm.  I'm not that technologically savvy but this is easy to install and use
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,SO easy to use,"This is great!  No computer needed, but can be connected with one little cord.  Slide your media card in the slot, your pics come on the screen.  Select the one you want, how you want it layed out on the paper and push print....that's all there is to it.  So great, even my ""electronically challenged"" hubby can use this. Buy the ink and paper kit to go with it, and you can print 100 photos!  The color is great and looks spectacular.  No more pics sitting around in the computer or on the digital camera cards....no they're finally getting printed out"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Wacom Intuos3 9X12 USB Tablet ,"This is an awesome tablet! It has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator, photoshop and painter. The pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse. The size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time."
electronics,,5.0,Easy way to know where you are,The GPS10 in combination with my IPAQ makes for an easy to use help when traveling. Best to have a large memory chip in place to hold a range of maps to cover possible destinations. Tiresome to land in a new place and the map loading software is back home
electronics,,5.0,Amazing Bass,"These headphones really puts excitement back in your music! Amazing bass, and overall sound quality for the price"
electronics,2 of 4,2.0,You Get What You Pay For.,"You get what you pay for, and my advise to anyone thinking of buying this answering machine phone combo is to pass on this model and brand name (AT&amp;T really doesn't make this system, THEY JUST PUT THEIR LOGO ON IT). Why pass on it? "
electronics,,4.0,nice but noisy,"Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more"
electronics,14 of 15,5.0,Works for me,"I needed a Video recorder with a programable timer to record all my TV shows and now I can watch DVDs at the same time!  Good picture, easy to hook up, easy to use.  I love it"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excelent,Discs works quite well. No problem using my Sony DRU 500-A DVD burner
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Serves all expectations,"I've a 20GB 4th gen Ipod.Needed a dock to feel the music at bigger pitch and this dock exactly serves this purpose.It's handy size,amazing voice clarity,universal power adaptor (110V-240V)and ease of installing it for the first time gives it 5 stars from me.You don't expect to change ""Menu"" of Ipod from 30ft ,so no fuss about that."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good Stuff,"It was a real good piece. The only problem with it is - when i hibernate the system, leaving the mouse attached - and restart it latter - it fails to reconginize the mouse. So i have to un plug and replug the wireless receiver - every time"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Great earbuds,Great earbuds! So much better than dealing with the long tangled mess that comes with the iPod. I like the way they are connected to the lanyard. Very cool
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect ,"It fits perfectly on de cup-holder and the ipod fits perfectly on it, it's very well built and it's not expensive."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Good product, a little roomy however...",This product is a good one.  The case is made out of quality materials ano the inside has nothing that can harm the computuer.  This particular case is a litle big for my laptop.  I found a nice case of similar quality at Best Buy after I bought this one for half the cost...so maybe shop around to make sure that the case you buy fits your laptop snugly.  Don't regret this purchase one bit though
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,We love this!  It works Amazingly Well. ,"After reading the previous reviews, we were quite tentative about purchasing this, and were expecting to probably return it. But we needed something that moves from car to car so we decided to try it. It is solid, doesn't move at all. Works quite well.  We can't seem to figure out why anyone would have problems with it - unless maybe they tried to suction the bracket to a dirty windshield or something.  Simply follow the directions and it works very well. We are more then satisfied"
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,I'm happy with it,"I bought this TV in December 2005 and it has been working great since. I haven't experienced any problems that were mentioned previously in the reviews and I'm very satisfied.  I use it in my room for DVDs, cable TV, and for my iPod's home dock (where I watch the iPod downloads on the TV) and I can't say I've had a better TV for my needs. I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony). I can't speak directly to the HD issue, but you should do your research if that's a deciding factor for you. HD wasn't really a priority for me, but low cost and quality performance were. I feel that my needs are met with this TV"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,"Solid, for better or for worse","The laptop pouch is well padded and a reasonable size (though my 13"" Macbook isn't deep enough to fill it out), and there's a good variety of pockets.  I haven't found a good place for the computer's power cord, but it's easy to stuff a lot of books, notepads, pens, and mints in there.  The zippers and strap clips are solidly made; no problems yet. "
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,Alpine iPod Connector Interface ,"Here are the pros of the iPod integration: Charges the iPod while I drive so it is always fully charged, the sound quality is great (much better than with the FM transmitters), and finally it keeps the iPod out of sight. Cons of Alpines iPod integration: THE INTERFACE SUCKS, THE INTERFACE SUCKS, THE INTERFACE SUCKS. Let me explain, the iPod is wonderful because it is so easy to use, however when ever you connect the iPod to the Alpine deck it blocks out the iPod controls so it can only be controlled from the stereo deck. This wouldn't be so bad except that the deck does a horrible job of controlling the iPod for two reasons, first because there is a huge lag time when browsing through songs, playlists, or artists. And secondly because the interface is so complicated to use, you have to understand that for me to have to read a manual for a piece of electroincs in pretty rare but for this thing I keep the manual in the glove box because it is so hard to use I have to read up on it every time I want to use it. Just browsing for a song can take as many as 6 button presses (which all have to be in correct order). I hear a second generation interface will soon be out, and I would suggest holding out for that"
electronics,,5.0,Very good backpack! ,"I love it, it is comfortable and neat and big enough for 15.4"" laptop"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Why Did I Wait So Long To Experience MP3??????,"This player is super fantastic, once you know how to operate it. It's my second player (1st one another brand) and of course I thought I could immediately ""work it"", but you must read the book first if you're new to mp3 like me.  I did end up online at iRiver to get a better understanding of how to download but after that, it was all uphill.  I love the sound, the versatility, the style, the graphics, just everything about it including the sound of my recorded voice!!  Now that I've learned to operate it, I would consider buying another iRiver with more memory"
electronics,,1.0,Have an iBook? Don't buy this lock!,"I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus"
electronics,4 of 7,5.0,Altec Lansing inMotion Plus for iPod,I gave this as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves it. It's extremely lightweight for travelling and for use without a power source. The sound quality if much better than we expected . . . a very nice surprise.
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Not Reliable and Customer Service is Poor,"Everything your read about the picture quality is true... however, this product just isn't reliable.  Cost me another $600 to get it fixed and it isn't even 18 months old. I am sure I am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues.  Customer service from this company is also very poor. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased this product and I probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed. I think it will be just a matter of time before some of these 5 star reviews begin to change their tune"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,"Excellent, comfortable design","When I first started shopping for a mouse wrist rest, I thought that a gel-filled one would be nice.  I saw a Fellowes rest at an office-supply store and bought it.  I love it because it's extremely comfortable and  takes all the weight off my shoulder.  Since then, I've tried other brands'  rests, but the gel portions aren't nearly as comfortable.  I've never had  any mouse tracking problems with the mouse pad, either"
electronics,4 of 7,5.0,Another Great Products From JAPAN!,"It last way longer than batteries from $1 store!  Work long enough for digital camera too.  Maxell batteries are amazing.  One day we went to a trip and found ourself out of batteries for my sister's digital camera.  Poor her, she had to dig her purse for old batteries to make sure they are really dead.  All others are really dead, however she found out 4 of these used (initially dead) maxell batteries to work again for 4 pics shots(2-3 minutes). She took her children pictures. You know children are hard to stay still and follow directions so it took her that long to take 4 pics.  I was like :O  Great product"
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,Works Great!,"This is a great product.  You do not need the Ipod dock to use this connector as it may seem from reading about it.  The connector clicks into the bottom of the Ipod.  You can plug the firewire side into the AC charger so that the battery is not used while transferring files and the USB 2.0 side can be plugged into your computer at the same time.  If you have any money left to burn after the cash you dished out for the Ipod, get one of these handy connectors.    "

electronics,21 of 21,5.0,"Easy to use, great value - but it's not a VoIP phone!","With the explosion of voice over IP applications, new devices appear everyday to supposedly ease our digital life, but the abundance of ""standards"" and protocols makes it difficult for the end user to figure out exactly what each product can accomplish."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Epson Photomate paper and ink kit.,"The product is very good. I've ordered one for myself, one for my granddaughter in Tex. and one for my daughter in ILL. However, I asked to have them sent to their add. The one to Texas made it fine but instead of sending the one to Lahr in ILL you sent to me and it cost me another $12.00 + to send it on to her. Other than that it's very good"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,I've Got The Power!,"Works great----Not sure if I'll ever need the surge protection...but it's nice knowing my gear is protected. The extra long, flexible power cord and color-coded outlets with labels are very convienent.  "
electronics,5 of 9,1.0,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I wasn't sure what I was thinking when I bought these headphones??? Maybe being a BOSE product, I expected an out of body experience or something but that never happened. $300!!! They're not worth that money unless you get excited over a nice fancy case and a few adapters! I've tried many headphones that are MUCH LESS in cost and some of them are just as good as the BOSE. Plus, whoever needed a battery for headphones to work? I find myself forgetting to turn it off and if you don't it will just stay on and when the battery is low, you get all kind of crackling and the power shuts off and on!"
electronics,13 of 15,5.0,"Worth it's price after first save, then just extra $$$","This product, according to RadarRoy website is the best radar detector you can buy. The Valentine V1 is awesome (especially the arrows), but it gives too many false alarms, and the Escort x50 is great, but this edges it out with ease of use...other sites will tell you the same. I've already CLEARY have been saved from one ticket and so with the price of the ticket and traffic school, this thing is alredy paid for and to think it will keep paying for itself. It's so easy to use and works so well. JUST LAST NIGHT I was with my friends Sam and Chris and I got a Ka warning and told them this means police (here in Southern California) and the warning got stronger and stronger and sure enough on the side of the road, at night when it's hard to see them, was a highyway patrol officer. He'd already pulled someone over, but that could have been us without the Bel. But, with this no way, the range is awesome and if there gun is on, you will pick them up WAY before they see you... Really, this is simply a new addition to my must have list of things in life and I would recommend it to anyone else who drives with spirit. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Creative Labs Notebook Webcam,"I have been using this thing for a couple of months now. It is not professional quality by any stretch of the imagination, but for the price is more than adequate. It clips onto my Vaio laptop very nicely and was pretty easy to install. The usb cable sits nicely behind my screen."
electronics,,5.0,Works with iPod Video as well,"The iPod Video works well with this too, as long as you don't have it in a case. It's true that it's slimmer than the previous generations, but the suction cup holds it down with no problems"
electronics,,5.0,Best remote ever,"This is the best remote I've ever had, I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. It's far better than a much more expensive remote that is programmable via computer. and it's easy to use and reprogram. This item arrived quickly after I ordered it and was packaged very well so it came in excellent shape. This is the best thing I've ever bought on Amazon.com. I can't say enough good things about it"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Amazing,"I am probably one of the most musically/sound impared people on the planet.  I rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards.  I only notice substantial jumps in sound technology.  I am very reserved about getting soundcards, as I dont think I ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound.  I have gone from a adlib, to a SB, to SB16, to Audigy LS and now to this card.  That being said, this is probably the last card I will even pick up or need.  The sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards, and is amazing clear.  I love the front panel for adding my headphones if I need them.  I couldnt be happier with the price I paid or the product itself."
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Horrible - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have had this product for 9 months and it has not worked properly for 8 months.  I have had one ""return to company and they will fix it"" and it came back worse than when it started.  It would not play half of the songs I downloaded, even with the suggested low bit rate change per the company.  I have to reset it to switch songs, to turn it off, to turn it on - basically to perform any function.  I can only get customer service via their website, and it has been a never ending ""have you tried....."" despite the blatant fact that it should work the first time, simply, without a lot of reformatting and resetting.  "

Had to call Netgear but guess what? They are outsourced workers from India who don't know what they are talking about! Believe me I had to go to their website to figure things out myself? Can you believe the US outsource jobs to other countries who can't speak english plus are not qualified to answer your questions? I called 3 times so it was not a coincidence? Anyways, keep away from this Wpn111 adapter no more range than a wg111t 108mpbs( Better to purchase the Wg111t because better signal than the Wpn111 RangeMax"

It can't read data from media. I contacted customer support and heard it costs $19.95 to diagnose, and $150 to fix it. Can you believe this????!!!!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Good Product!,"I was concerned about buying these discs after reading all the bad reviews.  However, the price was too attractive to resist.  Plus, I have used other TDK media in the past and was always satisfied.  I received the product and immediately tested the discs.  To my disappointment, my dvd drive could not recognize the disc.  I tried several more times with the same results.  I was about to give up and send the discs back to Amazon when I decided to adjust my burn speed and try one last time (actually adjusted upwards to faster burn speed).  VOILA!  Worked perfectly.  I have been through almost all 100 discs and have not had one disc fail.  That is just my experience.  Sometimes, all you need to do is adjust the burn speed.  I know that on some Sony DVD-R that I bought I had to adjust the burn speed down before they would work properly.  "
electronics,,4.0,First Impression: Great Idea....does the job!,Even though this phone seems to be getting bed reviews I was still tempted to get one because it's a great idea. I travel a ton and nothing is more frustrating then having to bounce from phone to phone with each country I go to. With this phone it's just a matter of being in a place that has wifi...and more and more places are starting to have it.

I have a pioneer deck tv (5700) and it is compatible with this ipod connector.  so i got the connector, read the directions for a hook up (seemed easy enough) and when i got my deck out i realized the cable that connects the headunit to the adapter is the same cable that connects my sirius satellite radio to my deck and there is only one of these connections on the deck.  so how can i possible hook up both the ipod adapter and my sirius at the same time.  is there some kind of splitter the douchbags at circuitcity failed to tell me about"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Great DVDs,First Time user of memorex. A friend recommended them. works absolutely perfect. used over 30 of these dvds with only 4 defectives burns and that was because of an OS problem
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Great Investment,"My puposes for the larger format is for engineering drawings. I had an Epson 1270 (used from EBay) which worked well. I needed an additional medium format unit, and the 1280 seemed the logical choice. I occasionally do photos for our sales group, and while it does indeed use a lot of ink, I found Concord Supply to fill this need at an affordable price."

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Upgrading to this DVD recorder was...a good thing ;-),"Being that the video tape I used with my old VCR would only last about 4 months, I ended up choosing to upgrade to this Panasonic DVD recorder. For me, its biggest selling point was the ability to used cartridge-based DVD-RAM discs with it...which I just TOTALLY love!!  And why wouldn't I? Because the discs are sealed inside cartridges, they'll never get dust, scratches or stuff like fingerprints on them, and last...100,000 times???!!! WOAH!!! I don't think they'll EVER wear out!! They're totally goof-proof!!"
electronics,,5.0,"Backpack for 17"" laptops","This backpack is a great buy to carry your 17"" notebook or laptop around.

electronics,8 of 10,1.0,"Slow, slow and SLOW!","Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great!,"These Maxell CD-Rs are much better than Memorex.  For music, it doesn't have any unwanted zzz....sounds like Memorex does, and is like live; for photos, it is vivid and fresh; for data, it copies the information correctly, smoothly.  It's a little bit expensive than Memorex brand, but it is worth the money.  Highly recommended"

electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Very functional,"This is a surprisingly useful gadget, as it serves as an extension cord and volume control. The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone, which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer. The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player"

electronics,,4.0,"Very cool, No problems so far","4.5 stars. I have this product with me for almost couple of months now and it works great in my town and on NY freeways (where FM signals are not so jammed) though it was not of much use in Chicago. Transmission is very clear without any humming noise. The extra slot for cigarette lighter adapter is very useful, I use it to charge my phone all the time. All in all very robust piece with good sound quality and very much worth 18 bucks you pay for it. I do recommend this transmitter."
electronics,34 of 37,5.0,"Works great, economical price","I do a lot of hiking in state parks where I create detailed trail maps for the hiking guidebooks I write.  I use a Garmin GPSMap 60CS, but I don't like to always have to hold the receiver out in front of me as I hike.  By using this antenna, I can keep the GPS in a hip holster and mount the antenna inside my hat.  It's fairly unobtrusive, but a little dorky if you look at me closely.  In the past, I have always used the Garmin external antenna.  It works great but is expensive.  I needed a new antenna, so I decided to buy this one from Gilsson because it had received many good reviews on the GPS newsgroup and was very inexpensive.  It has met all my expectations.  It seems to have a little better sensitivity than the built-in antenna, but the real benefit is that it allows you to put the GPS wherever you want (like inside an automobile or on your belt) without losing sensitivity.  As long as the antenna has a clear view of the sky you're fine.  It doesn't come with any extras (mine didn't even have an instruction manual!) but it's not hard to figure out.  Just snap the MCX connector into the connector on the back of your GPS (you need a model with an external antenna input) and that's all.  The housing is much smaller than the Garmin, nicely made.  Good cable, adequately strain-relieved where it feeds into the housing.  I always route the cable through the metal D-ring that attaches the battery housing on the back of the 60CS, better protecting the fragile MCX connector.  There are two magnets in the housing under a piece of tape.  These allow you to mount the antenna to a magnetic surface such as an automobile roof.  You can peel back the tape and remove them to reduce weight and avoid damaging magnetic media such as disk drives.  It also comes with two flat-head screws you can use for permanent mounting. You can't beat this antenna for the price"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Wonderful product!!,I absolutely love these headphones!

I would buy them again in a heartbeat! 
electronics,2 of 5,4.0,Panasonic just misses,"This Panasonic is all right, except I would die to get my old Sony system back.  They just don't have the sound quality at Panasonic that Sony had with these small systems.  I don't like that I don't have a clock display at all times and sometimes the CD changer is confusing to me, but it will just take time to figure it out.  Since these kind of bookshelf stereos are becoming more obsolete, I am happy to have this one.  With all the sound quality of the Sonys I have owned (I've gone through a half dozen) it will please me if this just hangs on and does not become a disappointment in functionality.  I would like this one to hang around longer.  Hopefully, the CD reader will not go out like my Sonys did"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Micro with U3 ,"Good product. Keeps data secure. Only downfall is that if you insert another Sandisk thumb drive while using this one, problems occur. They aren't designed to be identified separately (share the same drive address) so only one can be read while both are inserted. Using it solo... Great product"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Does NOT  fit the S Series notebook,"Once you get the package, if you read the cover it says it is not only for the S series but it also for another type of laptop. And the laptop case is meant for laptops that are up to 15 ins. I bought this thinking it would snug fit with my S Series notbook but it was WAY TOO BIG! I kept the package for the power cord case. Other than the power cord case fitting, the case for the laptop itself is CRAP"

It charges my ipod from the wall.  Thats what I wanted and it does it for way less money then Apples product THAT they should be including with a $400 iPod.  Apple makes some great stuff, but they are ripping us off in a sense by not including a wall charger.  I mean you don't always have a usb port around.  But anyways great charger for the money.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent DVD player,"This DVD player played movies which I could not run even on my laptop. Almost every CD & DVD in my huge movie collection written using a variety of different formats (divx, mpeg, etc) all ran smoothly without absolutely any problems. For the price this deal is a steal"
electronics,,1.0,Terrible!,"I'll sum it up quickly.  Terrible software.  Huge waste of time to get it working, although it did finally work.  Then the case fell apart within one month requiring glue and tape, which held another month.  Then replacement with a quality product.  Steer clear"

After spending our honeymoon in Club Paradise, Palawan, Philippines, and taking so many totally great pictures, it just stopped working. It was working when I was taking pictures in Palawan, but when we were going to take our last picture on the plane, the digital camera just said CF Error. Damn! I tried reading it on my card reader when I got home and it wouldn't work. Even tried it on 4 different digicams and all reported error. Man, it's not the card I'm really pissed about, it's the pictures!!!! MAAAAAN!!! I couldn't even have it replaced, Circuit City says I need the receipt for them to replace it"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,E4C >>>>>> weak bass?!?!?!,"Ok, here are few things I have to clear up before you go ahead and buy the headphone."
electronics,,5.0,Best Mouse I have owned!,This is once of the most comfortable mice I have owned! I like i a lot
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great sound quality,"These headphones are great and have great sound quality, although it took a few times to get them refolded in the case right"
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,Great product,This product is a nice headset that did fit nicely on my ear (lucky fit I guess) and was easy to work with.  It is compact and feels quite natural for me.  Not to mention it is designed to work on either ear so in the middle of a conversation you can just change ears
electronics,,4.0,Good mouse for the money,"I bought this mouse for my Macbook a couple of months ago, and I am pretty satisfied with it.  I wish I would have bought the mac mighty mouse that I have recently heard about, but I really like this mouse because you don't have to have a receiver.  If you pick the mouse up, it will freeze on you for a couple seconds so just keep it on the surface, but it isn't a really big deal.  If I were you, I would definitely buy this mouse because it is cheap works very well."
electronics,5 of 9,2.0,No speed dial or answering machine,"The phone has excellent sound quality but I was very disappointed that it only has three speed dial numbers - It has 8 extension buttons that I will never use since it is for my home office. They should have reversed the buttons, 10 speed dials and 3 extensions. "
electronics,,4.0,Canon PIXMA iP90 Photo Inkjet Printer,"This is a great printer for someone who wants a very small compact printer that will print good pictures.  It is very portable and quiet.  I really like this one.  The only two problems or negatives are the fact that the battery does not come with it which may disappoint someone who will use this as a strictly portable printer.  Secondly, the ink cartridges, which need to be small, really don't last that long so it would be a good idea to have a couple of spares."
electronics,102 of 104,5.0,required for 5.1 surround,"Optical cables are used primarily to connect a DVD player or a game console supporting Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS surround sound to a reciever. Unlike Dolby Surround, which is used on VHS tapes, TV broadcasts, and digital cable and encodes left, right, center, and ONE rear center speaker into stereo sound, true 5.1 (three speakers at the front, two at the back, and low frequency effects channel for the subwoofer) encoding requires a wider frequency range which is not supported by RCA audio connections. Therefore, either an optical or digital coax cable must be used.  A digital cable is just a light guide. Shielding or frequency response, important for video cables, are not much of an issue here. Therefore, an expensive optical cable will work just the same as a cheap one, unless the cable is defective. Keep in mind, however, that in order to get 5.1 surround to work, you may have not only to hook up the digital cable, but also (1) check the settings of your DVD player / game console to make sure that optical output is enabled, and 5.1 surround signal is not downmixed to standard stereo (consult your DVD player manual), and (2) that the optical input of the reciever is used when you choose the DVD player as input. Most DVD players also have a digital coaxial output, which works exactly the same for 5.1 surround as optical output. A digital coax cable usually costs less and may be a cost-saving option to consider. Home theater systems usually do not include optical/digital coax cables, so do not forget to order one together with your home theater system"
electronics,4 of 10,5.0,Excelent Product,I used for 2 month and is perfect.. really.. is easy to use.
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,"Great concept, poor execution...","I like the idea of being able to slap up my iQue in GPS mode on the windshield of my Eurovan and go, while keeping it charged. In that respect, the suction cup mount partially works: it keeps the GPS going perfectly, but the suction cup is both too small and too ineffective to stay put where I slap. It kept losing suction (this is where ""it sucks"" would have been an attribute) and dropping off the windshield, to lie on its side 'til the next Rest Area. I finally resolved the issue by attaching the grip half of Velcro tape to the suction cup, rotating the cup, and attaching the stand to my dashboard carpet cover. That works just fine, and I continue to have the benefits others alluded to without having to deal with a loose iQue. You might want to consider the sand-bag version, or keep in mind that if this unit won't suck, you can stick it"
electronics,,2.0,"works ok, but no wonder","I've had several UPSs now for a while. Belkin UPS quit after about 3 years of work. I understand that this may be long enough, but I have several from APC and they are still working. One UPS, I think, now has been in service 7 or 8 years"
electronics,4 of 6,1.0,Terrible quality. Buy a fifferent brand and save yourself the trouble.,"This is the worst USB flash device I have ever used. I was concerned about the quality of PNY products to begin with, but after using this drive I will stay away from any other products they manufacture. I have already had 1 fail on me when the usb attach part broke off after 2 weeks, and then another that, for me, was not machine washable. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy. Caveat Emptor"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Quite good for the price,"This little reader is fast and as easy to use as a USB flash drive. Pop in your card, plug it in, and wahlah, all your files are shown. Transfers are very fast and easy. It uses a standard USB cable, so it's likely you could use the same cable for a variety of devices (MP3 player, camera, cell phone)"
electronics,3 of 18,4.0,Definitivamente una buena opci�n.,"He tenido la oportunidad de adquirir varias laptops a lo largo del tiempo y con cada una siempre procuro comprar un buen maletn, esta vez me dediqu a buscar un morral o mochila que cumpliera con mis expectativas:"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Expensive, but works perfectly","While I can't compare this product's effectiveness to that of other screen cleaners, as this is the first one I've ever used, this product works amazingly well and restored my LCD to its original glory."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Just Plug & Play,"It has been about three months since I purchased this product from Amazon & I am extremely satisfied. The device is simple to set up. Just plug it in, set you stereo to the corresponding frequency & Voila! you're up & running. Do you get CD quality sound? Close to it. I live in L.A. so the entire FM dial is filled end to end with stations so I do get some static periodically but all in all this transmitter delivers. The fact that it charges your Ipod as you use it is icing on the cake. I recommend this product"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Cisco to the rescue,"Cisco bought Linksys a while back -- smart move! Can't get any easier -- works great, while it is smaller than the Linksys router, it still sits nicely on top, although feet pattern does not match"
electronics,42 of 42,4.0,Considerable Disaster Relief,"Having suffered terribly in the tropical heat in the aftermath of a couple of hurricanes last year, where it took from one to three weeks before power was restored, when I found this fan on sale at a local store, I purchased it and what seemed to be a large supply of D cells.  I really was surprised, however, when I actually ended up needing to use it for just that purpose.  We were without power for a full week (and that was lucky!) and was grateful to have the fan (some others in the region will be without for as much as three weeks! and the weather is warming back up a little... they will be wishing they'd bought one of these).  It's simply amazing the amount of pure joy and relief one gets when the power comes back on!"
electronics,,5.0,Good value for money,"Batteries have quite a long life, and recharging takes one hour"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Fits in tight spaces,"I've had this for a couple of weeks.  Best part is a design that allows you to plug it in even if another USB device is plugged in, something my previous flash drive couldn't do.  Construction seems solid and the neck strap that comes with it helps you keep from losing it.  A little more expensive than the cheapest 1GB but I'm glad I spent a little more to get a better design"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,"powerful, cheap...amazin","im a college student, hence, i want something to blast music at parties but am also on a budget, so these speakers are amazing, and i would def recommend them to everyone."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,SanDisk Ultra Hight Performance 4GB CF card,This card worked flawlessly - with great capture speed.  I recently went on vacation and took in excess of 400 fine Jpeg shots.  No need to bring a computer to download to
electronics,0 of 5,5.0,Plantronics DSP-400,The best PC Headset i have ever used!! Try it with no dout!
electronics,,1.0,Fails to integrate with other packages,"This product has great potential.  However, I would recommend it only if you use no other accounting package and are happy with the features provided by the NeatReceipts software."
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Vtech I5808 Products,I have used other Vtech phones and this is an improvement over the previous models. The phone looks good and works well.  I will continue to purchase Vtech phones. 
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Decent Microphone,"When I bought this mic, the first thing I thought was great quality, great price. Till I looked at the custom fees. All together the microphone cost me around $[...]? I had to get used to the volume control, after I got the hang of it people were complementing on my volume balance and sound with the beat. It will take you a few days to get the hang of the volume control, maybe weeks to master it. I've had my microphone for one week now, and I think I got the hang of it. If you want the microphone to perform well, you will need a pop filter. I made one with an old slim metal coat hanger, and an old thong that I found in my house. Once I used it with the microphone, the quality blew me away. It was alot better then staying 10 inches away from the microphone, knowing you will catch an echo while recording. If you live within the country this is available, buy it. You won't have to pay any customs, only shipping."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Not Meant for Larger Laptops,"OK, I read all the reviews and knew what I was getting into.  I have one of those behemouth 17"" desktop replacement laptops, you know the kind...weighs like 10 lbs.  This laptop already has 3 fans on the underside and they always run.  Thought I'd try a laptop cooler. I knew it would not fit under my notebook well but bought it anyway.  The LapCool3 fans are quiet, much quieter than the 3 OEMs.  I have had the LapCool3 for several weeks and as it teeters under my notebook it is always running---as well as the 3 OEM fans.  Can't say that my notebook runs any cooler.  Suffice to say that the LapCool3 would be pretty good for standard size laptops, appears to withstand the weight of this my 10 pounder so for the little guys its a good deal"
electronics,25 of 30,4.0,I'm a Pod person now,"I give this iPod 4.5 stars out of 5. I always wanted an iPod so last year I bought an iPod mini at the low, low price of $300. I was disappointed that I had paid so much for something that didn't even have a radio and I returned it to the store. Instead, I bought a Creative Muvo Micro, a tiny pink player with a replaceable triple A battery and an FM radio. I thought, why should I pay $300 for an iPod with several gigabytes of space that I don't need just because it was pink and cool looking, when I could have a $100 player that has more. Me and my Creative Muvo Micro were getting along great for an entire year before the unthinkable happened...I lost it. I searched for 2 weeks for the little thing and I still can't find it, so I needed a new mp3 player. If I'm going to get something new, I want something with more space, better sound quality, a better screen, just something of better technology than the player I bought a year ago. I didn't want an iPod, but every other player sold in stores is big, black, and ugly. Since the iPod Nano was now a more reasonable price at $150 for a silver one, I bought it. I wanted a pink one, but I didn't need 4 gigs of space and besides, you should get a case that covers your iPod to protect anyway, so I just bought a pink case instead. I've had this player for a week and so far I love it."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Impressed.,"So far, I am very happy with the Panasonic DMR-ES20K DVD Recorder. I did need to use the instruction manual to get up and running, but it only took a few minutes and I was burning my first DVD. I bought this unit to record shows saved on my TiVo, and it's working great so far. It allows you to name the chapters, among many other features, which I haven't learned yet. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good value memory you can get for a low price,"This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price!"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Just as good as other ethernet.,This is a good price for a ethernet cable.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,1gb CF card,"Price was nice, works great in my Fuji digital camera, delivery was super fas"
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,"Great mouse, but no carry bag included",I like this mouse alot its not too big or too small its perfect
electronics,,5.0,Overly critical reviews are not justified,"I bought one...  Just bought 2 more.   This DVD player is a gem for the money.  I'm on a very busy schedule so I can't verify what I'm going to say here, but I belive I'm playing HD on this unit.  I downloaded some  HD clips thru bittorrent and usually have to play these on my pc connected to the HD monitor.  I copied these AVI and MPEG clips to a dvd, popped them in this player and watched outstanding clear HD quality vid on my HDTV monitors.  I don't know if there is some upscanning or down scanning going on between this dvd player and my NORCENT 32"" HDTV, but my eye is seeing 1080 resolution and images so sharp I cna see the goose bumps on an olympic swimmer.   "
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Avoid buying at all costs!,These discs are horrible.  I bought a spindle of fifty and only had 2 successful burns.  If you read about memorex dual layer discs in newsgroups of dvd copying websites everyone in the forum complains about how bad they are.  I'll never burn to memorex ever again.  Avoid at all costs
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Awesome pair of inexpensive headphones.,"I'm just trying out these headphones, and I have to say that I am impressed. Very good bass out of these. Very comfortable to wear. I've had them on almost all day at work and no problems. The volume control is easy to use and one of the features I like best since my mp3 player doesn't have everything at the same volume. Adjustment is quick and easy. Cord is long enough. I have no complaints so far. Very good sound for the price"

electronics,4 of 4,1.0,BULL CRAP....DOESN'T WORK... grrrrrrrr............,I own a brand new Nissan Maxima 2006 and it comes with a BOSE stereo system. I had a fm trasmitter before and it always has this static sound which is quiet annoying.
electronics,26 of 29,1.0,Poor sound quality,"I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good. "
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Acoustic Research AW721 Way Better Than the AW771/772,"As a hearing impaired person, the Acoustic Research AW721 is a wonderful product!  Recently, however, they blew a speaker and I had to return them to Best Buy.  Unfortunately, they no longer carry this product.  Instead, they provided me with the AW772 which was $20 more and had the automatic tuning feature.  I thought this would be a great feature.  The negatives were that the new product only goes 150 feet and as a result of the automatic tuning feature, the signal would be searching at the most inappropriate times (like when you needed to hear what line the actor was saying on your favorite show).  Also, the newer version did not increase the volume loud enough."
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,Wonderful,"Bought this for my mother (a Buddhist nun) after doing a bit of research.  She took it to remote China for a 3 month trip and used it extensively for playing her chanting music and listening to mp3-encoded teachings.  She, and her numerous peers during the trip, were thoroughly amazed at the sturdy build and the great sound quality from these tiny speakers.  She thinks it actually sounds a bit better now that it has been 'worked in' a bit.  Definitely worth the money.  She loves it"
electronics,,5.0,Same as Sony,I found no difference between this and the Sony brand Memory Stick Pro Duo. Save money and buy from a non-Sony Brand
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,This Phone is Fantastic!,I just picked one up for a new house and it looks good and works great. I highly recommend this system as an alternative for the expensive $$$$ B&O phone systems. Worth every penny
electronics,4 of 7,4.0,"Samsung LT-P1545 15"" Flat-Panel LCD TV","First, I would buy it again if I needed to.  This 15"" takes up less space on the kitchen counter, i.e., speakers are on the bottom. Second, picture and sound are excellent, i.e, clear."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,On the go great!,"I am the type of person that needs things compact and easy to utilize.  I rapidly have to switch from listening to music at work, at the gym, on the go, and to relax.  This small yet compact iPod is great for listening to music without knowing you have it attached to you.  I highly recommend this over any other MP3 player."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Replacement ink,Required to keep my photo printer running. It is a very good product
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,"Excellent unit, clunky interface","I love the iRiver H-120!  The sound quality is very good, both in digital files (e.g., mp3's) & the FM tuner.  It has a ton of features not found in the iPod, including recording in a compressed format, FM tuner, mounting like a hard drive (so you can back up ordinary computer data on it), and more.  The unit lasts forever on a single charge, and it charges very quickly.  It also comes with extras, including an external microphone, a wired remote unit, and more.  It's pretty small too -- roughly the same size as an iPod or maybe a tad bigger.  Having reviewed user complaints about the included earbuds, I went out and bought some Sennheiser portable headphones -- they sound much better than the earbuds included with the unit.  Note that I have higher-end Sennheisers too and the iRiver can push the volume very loud on them without distortion; this is impressive because my higher-end headphones have a lot of resistance and require a lot more power to drive than earbuds or my portable Sennheisers."
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,my ear holes must be too big!,"I bought these because the price was really cheap, and they got fairly good reviews. I garden often, and am always listening to my ipod or talk radio. These kept falling out of my ears. Maybe if i find foam covers for them at the dollar store and try them out again, but from now on, I'm staying with the earhook designs, particularly the blue sony's found about everywhere for ten bucks. The sony's are pretty durable, as even with getting them snagged several times a day, i only have to replace them about once a year. Sorry, Sennheiser, i really wanted to like you too"
electronics,,5.0,A MUST-HAVE in MN and CA...and it works as advertised.,"Since MN and CA have enforced vehicle laws that prohibit the suction mount (i.e. ""nothing between the driver and the windshield""), this is a must-have item if you live-in/drive-through one/both of these states.  Like others, I also go tired when the suction mount develops micro-holes and starts dropping off the window while driving.  This obviates that problem.  I have also used it in a number of vehicles and found it works best on the more uneven dashboards (surprising to me).  The unit (an I2 for me) is very adjustable in this mount; and the mount really does work well as it has a bit of heft to it.  Next test is to see if it gets through TSA airport security in my carry-on luggage.  Overall:  very satisfied with this purchase because it does exactly what it says it will do"
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,great sound ,i got my 3.2.1 system from a big retail store it  sounded great in the store so i took a chance knowing great history of sound from bose the hook up only took five mins. i very pleased how good this unit sounded not running wires to the back of the room was great too so it looks clean and sounds great it does seem kind of overpriced but still i have heard true 5.1 systems that dont sound this great the 3.2.1 it a great choice for someone who wants simple but great sound ........
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good and long lasting,The product is useful and the last one I had lasted for over two years with nearly daily use
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Did my homework and it paid off!,"I picked up ""GPS for Dummies"" book to begin my education on GPS units before plunking down my money. After deciding that I needed a unit which could be used in my truck, as well as for hiking to selected spots in the desert, I decided on the Garmin 60CS.  I must say that I was very pleased and quite impressed with the multitude of features that this unit has. Displaying phases of the moon, altitude and barometric readings, not to mention the best times for fishing only added to the excitement that I felt as I mastered its very configurable interface."

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"A Trip to StoneMountain, GA","I read some of the reviews and wanted to let you know that for the money I purchased 2 for my son and my brother in Jersey. I took a trip to stonemountain park in GA, my son played his playstation 2 game fine. The only problem I had was with the S600 Mercedes the inverter didn't cut off when the key was out and in the on position-so when I went to use some of the keyless devices like truck open/close I found they didn't close. I found the inverter was still on and just cut it off everything worked fine after that-so remember to cut it off when car is not running. It fit the lighter better than previous adapters I've purchased with other vehicles.      "

electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great Ergonomical Keyboard & Mouse Pair,"This purchase was one of my smartest purchases from Amazon.  Earlier in the year I suffered from ulnar nerve damage, which is damage to your elbow, caused by excessive typing at an unnatural angle. (Always remember to type with your elbows at a greater than 90* angle.)  The way regular keyboards work is they make you pull your elbows into your sides to type... this keyboard corrects that habit, and I'm able to once again have the use of the last three fingers of my right hand.  The angle apparently pinched the nerve in my elbow connected to those fingers."
electronics,17 of 18,5.0,photo printer,"I purchased this printer for my parents who are basically illiterate when it comes to computers and never used their digital camera because they never could figure out how to print the pictures on their regular photo printer. I got it with free shipping, in just a couple of days.  The printer works great (the color originally didn't print correctly-it was purple-but a quick cleaning of the heads fixed this.)  There are probably portable printers with higher resolution out there, but for $150 this was perfect and the pictures look great!  My one complaint was that if I purchased the photo paper through amazon, I lost out on the free shipping, so I went and got the paper at Staples"

electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Price Confusion,"I agree with all the reviewers regarding the factory installed Panasonic batteries vs. the higher quality Energizer replacement batteries.  What really threw me is the drastic difference in prices for ths same product (ER-P511).  I noticed that at one dealer alone, in this case DB-Roth, they had 4 different prices for the exact same product.  The prices ranged from $6.99 - $10.49.  However, finding the best deal is not as simple as choosing the lowest priced item.  Once I added in shipping, prices for 5 of the batteries (I wanted to have extras for our phones) ranged from $51.34 - $65.54.  Strangely, the lowest total price came from the batteries that were listed at $8.95 each."
electronics,14 of 15,5.0,All around great Product,"I was skeptical when purchasing this Travel Case.  We just purchased as Portable DVD player and was leaving for a road trip, and it wasn't safe just sitting on the console.  Once I strapped this to our mini van, it was awesome.  It brought the player higher up so it was at eye level, and closer to the children in the backseats.  I totally reccommend this product.  Great product and easy to install"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Phenomenal fidelity.,"I've owned all kinds of reference-quality headphones in the past. While the E5Cs are, in terms of sound quality, not superior to the best Sennheiser or Grado headphones, these are as close ""to being there"" as you can get with an in-ear design and they have phenomenal fidelity for an in-ear design while also blocking almost all outside noise."

The Earpod is not broken -- it is easily put back together but comes apart even more easily, so it is no longer suitable for jogging. I still use it to protect my earphones when I travel (and in this capacity it works well) but not when I'm wearing them"
electronics,27 of 39,2.0,BEWARE OF iPOD HARD DRIVES,I have purchased the iPods since the first day they came out and I have to tell you that it is a love/hate purchase.
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Value,"I purchased this speaker system for use with my TV/DVD in a bedroom.  Originally, I wanted the similar Bose system, but the Altec Lansing VS4221 was $170 cheaper!  The sound quality is great and it more than fills the room with sound.  The sound is crisp and clear; much better than the muddy sound from the TV speakers.  The bass can be really strong though I keep it turned down for a more balanced sound.  "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,This is a great bag! I use it daily.,"The bag is very nice. It is big enough to hold two laptops if you do not need to carry textbooks around. I put my E1505 in it and it is a tight fit. They have a design with the space between the laptop sleeve inside and the botton of the bag (I forgot how it is named). IMHO, it is just a design without any real meaning of protecting your laptop. I just add another form under that and I think that would be more helpful in protecting my equipment."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,intuos 6x11 ,I bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and I use it
electronics,12 of 13,4.0,Jensen Headset,"I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it does not give a snug fit on my ear, however it does stay in place while talking and working in the kitchen, etc.  Those I have spoken with said they cannot tell I'm using a headset.  The sound quality was clear from my end as well. I definitely recommend this product"
electronics,,5.0,What a great buy!,"I've been having fun making tapes of weddings, parties, etc. I'll be ordering more tapes soon! I was thrilled at the price, delivery time, and quality of the product"
electronics,,5.0,Great keyboard!,"This keyboard is really awesome. It's nearly silent, and the keys feel very good. You also don't have to push down hard or far, and everything is nice and compact. Little to no strain on the wrists and fingers. Very comfortable feeling. Some of the buttons are in a bit of an odd place, but it doesn't take much time getting used to the layout of the keyboard. This is easily one of the best, if not the best keyboard I've ever owned"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Sony Headphones Have Bass,"I am a very active person, so I have used many headphones before these that could not hang with excessive movement. I run, play soccer, bicycle (not recommended due to safety) with these earbuds and they are right there with me every step of the way. The sound quality is not as good as fully enclosed phones for obvious reasons, but these are manuverable, light headphones that have great volume and good bass response. "
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Not for new ipod with video,"I Purchased this case for my ipod video.  It doesn't stay closed very well and the hole for the headpone jack is on the top left of the ipod but it is in the top center of the case so you have to skew it off to the side just to have the headphones in.  It works ok but it looks like crap because it isn't really designed for this particular ipod.   Maybe it would work better for older models, I don't know"
electronics,1 of 19,5.0,Great Product,"This product is awesome....of course, it's a Sony :)"
electronics,,5.0,UGLY BUT GREAT,"This unit is not especially aesthetically pleasing, but the sound is wonderful, and it is a joy to use.  I highly recommend it!"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,"Very dependable product, very poor documentation","No problems whatsoever since I installed the router several months ago. The only problem is installing the router and getting it working with your modem. Don't bother with the sparse Linksys documentation. Just contact your ISP for information on how to ""bridge"" your modem because this is what you have to do to get your wireless router to work with you modem."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Unit,"I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I like this unit so much that I thought I'd capture a few points that I think make this player a great choice:"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great device for geocaching,"I already had a GPS for my car, but was looking for a small, inexpensive handheld GPS to use for geocaching.  I wanted to get my twin grandsons interested in the hunt.  Love the Legend, it is very accurate and ready to use out of the box.  In some ways I like the simple maps and use it on the interstates often.  Got my grandsons on a hunt or two and they are hooked.  Their mom asked me what unit they should buy and I immediately replyed the Legend.  It is basic, inexpensive and easy to use, what more could you want."
electronics,19 of 19,5.0,Very happy so far...,"I bought this as an auxillary phone.  We've got an answering machine and a fax machine, but I needed an additional phone to be by the computer in my downstairs office and I wanted a speakerphone so when I was telecommuting I could call into meetings and listen to them without holding a receiver up to my ear.  "
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Sony DVPNS55P/S Single Disc DVD Player,"great product, prompt delivery, very reasonably priced, very easy setup and us"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome,"This adaptor is great, especially for the price.  Installation was as easy as it gets, right out of the box.  I had it up and running through a WEP-enabled local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes.  It locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection.  Both FrontPage and ClieMail ran fine.  Speed is maybe 80% of what I get on my laptop running a 333 MHz. Celeron and a PC card 802.11b adaptor.  Just be sure your PDA is on the (small) list of supported devices."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"The Good, the Loud and the Ugly. ","I bought these little speakers a while ago to accompany my Mac G5 - but am now using them in my studio as the primary speakers. They rock. I haven't the hiss others have reported. Guess I got a good set. The sub-whoofer blows the walls, ceilings, etc. out. The only draw back for me are the aesthetics of the high-mid range turbine-like pods. Kind of remind me of a bad set detail from that horrible Jude Law / Gwyneth Paletrow - Flash Gordon/Fritz Lang inspired film of last year. They are just plain U-G-L-Y, but well enough designed with lil' rubber feet which grab nicely (thank god) to tight high spots on bookshelves out of the line of sight. The Whoofer is the customary black box. Again - for $150 - a great value."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,great phone,"I bought this to replace a horrible GE cordless phone system. Crystal clear reception, the people I talk to have no problems hearing me either. The only have two complaints I have is that the voice mail memory doesn't store enough digits to put my password in. However, the normal memory entried for my call directory does have enough. Strange, but no biggie. I love the ability to copy the memory over to the expansion sets I bought. However, the special rings for memory entries do not copy. Again, no big deal it would just be nice. Completely happy with this phone and I highly recommend it to others"
electronics,,5.0,Works great on a computer,I have not used it on a gaming unit yet but it work great on a computer to make it wireless.
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,Stand for Samsung TV,BAD:
electronics,,4.0,Great for iPod Video,"I bought this backup battery for when I travel and want to watch movies on the airplane.  It works great, 4 batteries allowed me to watch about 4 hours of video.  It's nice because you can turn the battery backup on and not use any of your iPods battery.  This allowed me to save my iPod battery for when I got off the plane to get a connecting flight or just walk around with it in my pocket.  It's also nice for watching movies because you can use the battery backup as a stand as you watch movies and not have to hold the iPod for the duration of the movie.  Definetly recommend, I would be cautious about the batteries that come with it, I read about them overheating the iPod"
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,This cable is the only way to go in your car.,"I have been searching for a good way to hook up my iPod to my car stereo and after looking at different ways (Griffin iTrip, Monster iCar FM transmitter, even the hundred dollar iPod car kits that allow you to control your iPod from your car stereo) direct cableing, such as the Nyko Stereo Link, was the best route."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,At least a $10 sound improvement from the originals,"I bought these at the Apple store and they were priced at $40, ten dollars more than a replacement pair that matched the originals. The price seems expensive, but given other options, it's really quite reasonable. They are louder with better bass response than the earbuds that ship with the ipod. "
electronics,7 of 12,5.0,Canon photo paper,"My Canon i9900 produces FANTASTIC prints on quality paper such as Canon's Photo Paper Pro. I love the printer. Gorgeous prints up to 13"" x 19""! Canon paper is expensive. Go to Costco (or other fine retailer) and get KIRKLAND Signature Professional Glossy Inkjet Photo Paper. 125 sheets of 69 lb. 8-1/2 x 11 for only about $19.00. That's just over 15 cents per sheet! I'm accustomed to paying $.50 to $.80 per sheet. The prints on KIRKLAND paper look just as good as the Canon. They may fade more quickly (I don't know that) but I can always print another when I'm saving that much on the paper"
electronics,,1.0,many people are having charging cradle problems,"Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue"
electronics,35 of 37,5.0,Incredible picture for a great price- It is so worth it!,"I used to swear by DLP projectors.  But the LCD AE900u changed my thinking is plenty good enough for me.  so much that it inspired me to write my first review.  It puts out a great picture with the least SDE of any digital projector I've ever seen.  This is AWESOME for my xbox 360 in 720P.  This is the BEST HD projector to get if you have a smaller room, or if you want your viewing distance close to the screen.  It is much quieter than the infocus x1 or sp4805, the colors are vibrant, the picture is bright and punchy, and the lens shift capability makes projector placement incredibly easy.  Some people say the image is a little soft, but it's only an illusion.  The ""sharp"" projectors in AE900u's class have an artificial grid that separates each pixel, and this grid increases the perception of sharpness.  This grid also is ugly and distracting if you sit anywhere close to the screen.  The 900U has ""smoothscreen"" technology to make the grid almost non-existant.  No more watching a movie and it looks like I am watching through a screen door (because of the grid).  the picture now looks more natural and film-like.  Do some searches and read some profesional reviews, and you will see that the AE900U is King of its class for its time"
electronics,,4.0,A great little MP3 player and voice recorder,"I use my MP3 player mostly for listening to audiobooks. I was looking for a player that would allow me to stop at any point and resume quickly. This unit fits the bill perfectly. While there are no bookmarks, you don't need them. It's better. All you do is shut it off. When you turn it back on it starts where you left off. Perfect for my needs."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Terk AM-1000 Antenna,"I read about the Terk in Monitoring Times magazine and decided it was worth a try, although I really didn't expect stellar results; I figured that better AM reception was worth a try since almost everything I listen to is on the AM Band.  It was reasonably priced and seemed like it should work."
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Good phone with annoying design problems,"Overall, I agree with the comments that this phone sounds great.  The two annoying issues are with the caller-id/phonebook and with chain dialing."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Seems to work fine...,"I bought this for my Sony digital camera. It was well packed and in good shape when it arrived. Popped it into the camera and its been a month, so far it seems to work great"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent value for money!,"I basically bought these because they were cheap. Cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example. The UR-20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies. It has excellent bass and sound isolation. I am by no means an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it and these headphones produce great sound, especially for its price."
electronics,,5.0,Sony Mini Shelf System,We were very pleased with the system.  It arrived on time (it was a present) and we found it easy to use and good value for the price. 
electronics,,5.0,great product,"The product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what I wanted.  I have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera, but will try to soon"
electronics,34 of 38,5.0,"If you know what you're doing, you'll love it","I've heard a lot of people say that this really isn't needed.  Most of these people intend to use it for their PSP.  This is not the only use for this card.  If you have a Sony camera that supports high speed shooting, this card is a must.  With that said, if you own a PSP, and you know what you're doing, this card is a must as well.  Reason is, the slower Memory Stick Pro Duo, has a write speed at 15Mbps.  The high speed card clocks in at about 80 Mbps.  Yeah.  Grab your USB 2.0 / Firewire Card reader for this one, it makes a HUGE difference."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Better than my old Belkin model,"It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. "
electronics,6 of 8,4.0,"So far, this radio seems fine","I bought this radio for my hurricane kit.  We've had the power go out for a week or more, so the crank power was appealing.  I also like the TV tuner (the TV stations have bigger news teams) and the weather radio.  "
electronics,11 of 13,4.0,"Great Kit, Rubbish Instructions",It's taken me a month to get this item working but is great now it is.
electronics,5 of 20,2.0,be aware," I received the speakers only couple days after purchased online, that was awesome delivery service."
electronics,8 of 9,4.0,Great Buy for the Money,"It's wonderful, but it ain't HD."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,pretty good,"I have had this for about a year and it has worked well. I specifically bought it to tune into radio, so I have not used the CD player and whatever functions it might have. Pretty light, 7 of 10 sound quality, can hang on wall, detachable speakers. Good for cost. I would recommend and buy for a gift"
electronics,,5.0,Panasonic DMR-E75V Recorder,"Absolutely fantastic, my recorder stopped formatting my DVD-Ram disks. I had used the recorder approximately 1 yr, After using Maxell's DVD cleaner disk, all is back to normal. Great product even a simpleton can use it, follow on screen instructions and you are home free"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,dj sets,it is the most popular headset around DJs because is has earn it's places as THE BEST. qaulity vs. Prices is unbeatable
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Great unit,"Great unit! gets me where I want to go, no more maps! I dont need a unit with the whole U.S. on it, just the southeast. I was given an sd card of the southeast for free when this unit was purchased(cost 50.00).Its all I need, simple to operate. With the voice commands you really dont even have to look at the screen, just listen. Very accurate with the optional exterior mounted magnetic antena(sp?)"
electronics,,4.0,Pleased,These speakers have great sound for thier small size. The speakers also look good! The only thing that keeps them from being a five star item is the fact that the volume can only be adjusted using the remote control and not on the speakers themselves.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Ideal for linguistic field work!,"I am a graduate student in linguistics working with an indigenous language in Oaxaca.  I brought this speaker set to Mexico with me this year as a replacement for a bulky Panasonic cassette transcriber.  It worked like a dream.  Instead of using cassettes for transcription we used mp3s recorded on an Edirol digital recorder.  Instead of a transcriber we used a laptop with windows media player and these Altec Lansing speakers.  The sound quality was perfect for transcription, and the whole package was lighter and easier to manage than a transcriber.  In my down time I got to listen to music.  Can't beat that"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Palm E2 review,"Find E2 very good to use-ease of input, back-up, long battery life   between charges is very good. This is a most helpful tool to manage life. Glad to have it"
electronics,,5.0,Excelente Ventilador (Excelent Fan),"I'm from Caracas - Venezuela, I buyed this antec fan and is wonderfull, there speed is 2500rpm. great."
electronics,5 of 5,2.0,"It is a TOY, people","My 3-year-old loves this guitar, has loved it since Santa brought it for him because he feels just like Murray from the Wiggles.  We are currently about to buy our second one because after a LOT of use, the first one fell apart.  I must stress that this is a TOY, not a real guitar.  Do not purchase it to teach your child to play, or try to tune it like a real guitar.  It is a toy, and is priced as such.  You wouldn't buy your child a squirt gun and then try to put pellets in it, would you?  I feel certain there are child-sized, real, quality guitars out there if your child has a genuine interest in learning to play.  But for the child who just wants to be like the Wiggles, this one is perfect"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Disappointing,"I have had this unit for more than one year in two different locations and it has been more of a headache than it is worth.  It will continuously drop its connections with every device ever connected to it (be it a laptop, PDA, or Tivo) and occassionally just stops working altogether (wired and wireless).  The speed performance is also extremely disappointing - it is simply too slow for anything other than normal web surfing (which can become frustrating as the connection drops and reconnects at intervals ranging from one minute to an hour - undoubtedly disconnecting while making a small download or filling out a web form).  Service calls to Linksys and firmware updates have been unsuccessful in solving the problem.  While my problems with the router may be caused by the large number of other wireless networks in my apartment complex, it is, nonetheless, very frustrating - there are definitely more robust models on the market, and the small size of the unit doesn't make up for its poor performance"
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,DP 311U does not work for me and the tech support is terrible!,"I bought this DP-311U print server. I set it up according to the manual and i can print from different computers to the printer. However, a few hours later, it stopped working. I disconnect then reconnect everything, it started to work again. But a few hours later this same thing happened again. I called the tech people at D-link and started to explain the problem when the line was disconnected. I thought this must be an accident. I called again. After transfering to a different number and waited for about 10 minutes, i was just about to describe the problem again, the line was droped again. I checked my telephone lines, they were ok. D-link's tech support is just a waste of time. By the way, i have other similar products which work fine. "
electronics,,2.0,Doesn't Really Make A Difference,"I use a laptop since I am always on the go. I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time. I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop. It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great, but it really doesn't do much, if anything at all. I think the idea of the cooling pad is great, but not effective"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,"Bad battery, bad static = bad phone","Don't waste your money on this phone. From the first day the non-base unit had horrible static for anyone I talked to. The sound was fine on my end, but anyone I talked to on the non-base phone complained of horrible static, and when I called my house I heard it too and they were right it was horrible. The base unit developed the same charging and battery problems a number of others have already talked about. Avoid at all costs"
electronics,5 of 6,2.0,you get what you pay for,"these sound a lot better when i use the ""bass reducer"" in my equalizer.  this is because there is megabass built-in but no knob with which to adjust or turn off that feature."
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,3 years and going strong,"I bought these headphones over 3 years ago, and they are still going strong.  I use them in the office only, so they get little abuse (e.g. I don't blast the bass at work, or anything).  I have dropped them a number of times, though, and they didn't break.  The sound quality is good for listening to CDs, but like I said, I don't blast the bass or anything.  Finally, they are extremely comfortable.  I wear them for 7+ hours some days and they don't bother me one bit. "
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Durable CD wallets,I just got my CD wallets today and I found that the Velocity CD wallets was well built and durable.  The external is strong and the sleeve is smooth enough to protect my DVD.  Great price and quality for Velocity CD wallets
electronics,,4.0,pretty good,i like the shortcuts and programmable buttons and media keys.
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Nice and cool~,"Bought this wrist rest because my right wrist was starting to hurt from surfing the internet. The gel is cooling, unlike the fabric ones that becomes warm after a while. The color is very soothing and is small enough to fit in my tiny workspace."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Convenient, functional, yet redundant and incomplete","This remote control allows you to access the different options and menus with your TomTom GO 500/700 all without touching the screen. This is achieved by the use of a radio frequency and therefore it does not require a 'line of sight' with your GPS unit. The remote also allows you to easily adjust the volume of the audio instructions by the use of the top two -/+ buttons. In the center it has a radial dail that has up/down and left/right cursor functions as well as a large enter/select button in the center. There are two more buttons below this radial dail that I'm unclear as to their funtions, I believe they may also adjust the volume, but that seems to be redundant. There is one more button located bottom-center that I assumed to be an on/off button but it (nor any other button) did not serve in that capacity, if anything it appeared to be another enter/select button....again redundant. I've only had this device a couple of days and perhaps those buttons do serve as shortcuts to certain funtions, but with TomTom not providing any instructions other than how to insert the batteries along with descriptions merely touting its convenience, I'm left to tinkering with it myself to discover if any other funtions do indeed exist. There is also a protective holder included with the remote, that if you wish you can utilize the adheasive backing on it to mount it to any easily accessible place in your vehicle. I chose not to permanantly mount my remote's holder as I use my TomTom Go 700 in different vehicles, but that's a personal preference, who knows maybe these holders are, or will be available to purchase separately to mount in multiple vehicles. "
electronics,5 of 12,5.0,A must have!,"Once you have one, you'll find more uses for it than you ever dreamed possible!  I use mine constantly.  I wish I had bought one YEARS ago. Works great"
electronics,,5.0,Exceptional small flat screen TV,"What a buy - in a house with 2 large Sony TV sets (a large plasma and a slightly smaller LCD) this small and stylish flat screen from Magnavox needs little defending.  The quality of picture is outstanding and it fits into specialized niches such as bathrooms, kitchens, etc.  We're getting a third one of these for our study and are pleased with all the features this set has.  For the price, hard to beat"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,works great with my palm TX,I love my 2 GB SD memory card. I use it all the time and have had no problems with it
electronics,,4.0,"good, less expensive amplified phone","I purchased two EZI996 phones to replace some old ones which had worn out. They have good amplification of sound are light in weight for easy handleing. There are some conflicts with haveing the two base stations near one another in that sometimes one or the other phone will not activate after pushing the talk button several times on one phone but the other phone does start up correctly. The other unwanted action is that if while using one phone, you put the other on the base station, the phone you are using disconnects from the call. "
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,makes my life easier,"This is great, my tower is on the floor so instead of bending down each time I need to charge or change songs I can just plug it in to the nice small dock sitting on my desk.  I have had no problems whatsoever with it"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Convenient, Easy to Carry","I've had one of these for the past several years, using it on and off when wireless wasn't an option.  It has served me well and I really like how compact and convenient it is to use.  I find the build sufficient but nothing that couldn't be destroyed with a hard knock.  When using it, one has to be sure that the cable isn't recoiling all twisted or else that would damage the auto-retract.  I haven't had a problem with the retraction yet.  I don't use the telephone adapter too often but in the rare cases that I needed it, I was very happy to have this product on hand.  It saves me from carrying an extra cable and the telephone cable is sufficient for times when Ethernet isn't an option.  The only thing I would want more from this product is a longer cable but I don't know how that would affect the size of the product.  6' is sufficient for most situations but I wouldn't mind an extra 4' or more.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry around a phone/ethernet cable without the bulk/inconvenience of carrying the regular cables.  It is functional and understand that it isn't built like a tank and it'll serve you well as it has for me"
electronics,8 of 11,4.0,Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3 Player,"This Nano is, basically, a good value.  It holds a lot of songs and is very easy to use.  It has the capability to record voice messages and listen to FM radio in addition to downloaded songs.  The ""case integrity"" is poor.  The battery cover broke the first time I put batteries in.  Duct tape now holds it in place.  The ear ""buds"" that were included were W-A-Y too big to fit in my ears, so it cost an extra $25 for new headphones. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,SanDisk 2 GB MemoryStick Pro Duo ,Great price and great performance.  Used it for Sony camera with no compatiblity issues
electronics,,2.0,Fine While it Lasted,"I purchased mine in August 2004 and it is dead as of August 2006.  For travel, while it worked, it was fine; I loved the sleep function, the sound was OK although I chose to use portable speakers with it.  But it started behaving peculiarly about six months ago, not starting right up at times.  Considering the price and the brand name, this portable player should have had a longer lifespan"
electronics,13 of 27,5.0,The best one out there!!,"I have a computer that demands full power at all times and with my old 1566 joule surge protector, it could'nt keep up. This surge protector gives my computer more than enough power and will support it for a long time. 3540 joules is great for a new high end computer which demands a lot of power to run smoothly. It is definatly worth the 45 bucks"
electronics,,4.0,NANO rocks.,"Great battery life, easy to use, all around good.  The only minus is the dependency on ITunes"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Money well spent,"We bought this a few months ago as a late Christmas present.  I absolutely love it.  After lots of research felt this would be the best investment.  We intially bought this to go geocaching, but soon found it to be as useful for trip navigation, as well.    I was a little nervous because with all the functions, I felt I would not be able to fully utilize the unit.  I was wrong, this unit is powerful, compact and a snap to use.  Combine this with City Select V7 and you have all the tools and functions of a thousand dollar navigation system for a third of the price.  56K is more than enough space to store TONS of maps."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Picture Perfect,I just purchased the Canon 20D and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities.  Plenty of picture room and I plan to purchase a 2GB prior to my trip to IRELAND.  Price wise I did great and the turnaround time was excellent.
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,Quality Is Not A Factor Here,"I heard how TDK and Verbatim were the cream of the crop, so I got these. While people are right that you don't get a lot of coasters the problem is that only a dvd drive on a computer is going to read them if burned at a decent speed. When burning at 6x (slowest setting on my 16x burner) my PS2,XBOX, and three dvd players have had a very hard time reading from these discs. I bought some Sony +r that are 1x-8x since they were cheap and at my local Wal Mart, they shame TDK. I've tried many of the cheaper brands such as HP, Memorex, KHypermedia,Sony, and Phillips (can't remember others now) and only Memorex was worse than TDK. I will stick to Sony and/or Phillips; never a problem with Sony and minimal with Phillips"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,What more can you ask for...?,"I had already researched the Seagate 5.0 GB at Amazon for $89.95 when I happen to see the 6.0 GB at Sam's Club for $99.95. Plug and Play worked fine. I needed a larger device than a floppy to transfer data from work to home and vice versa, as well as photos to other family computers. I took one of the other reviewers ideas and store it in an Altoids can. Even though it is pocketable it is a hard drive with delicate insides, I suspect some of the one star reviews are due to it being treated like flash memory. It has two big advantage over flash - it is large enough not to be easily lost and the capacity is great."
electronics,2 of 8,5.0,Very pleased,"Its just what I was loocking for .Meybe i wouldnt need the red cross ,but the radio iv very good."
electronics,,4.0,Works as advertised but was a little confusing at first...,"As one can expect, this device can secure data using your fingerprint.  There is one drive that shows up as a Local Disk with the CruizerProfile Icon.  This is the unsecured drive.  Another drive shows up on Windows XP as a Removable Disk.  This is the secured drive.  There is a good review by ""J. F. Herlocker Jr."" that provides some more details"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Passable Disc - Terrible Panasonic Customer Service,In my opinion:
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Excellent Memory, Speed Very Good , Expensive!!","I got this memory for my fuji S5100, and it works great. I wanted to get higher size (1GB), but it is very expensive. I thought about it and i decided to get a Wolverine 20 GB SixPac Media Reader & Storage Drive, which copies  files from CF,SD, MMC or xD Cards and many more. It cost around $75 on ebay and now i don't have worry on the trip to carry a laptop to download or keep additional memory cards. Until the price of the xD card is not as cheap as CF or SD cards, i would advice everyone to buy this 128MB. Amazon.com is the cheapest than anybody in market. Remember as our Digital database is growing day by day and multiple Flash card formats, we would end up spending more on memory than the products we wish to use.A lesson i have learn't"
electronics,,5.0,Absolutely love this system!!,It's very loud and great sounding.  Very easy hookup and I love the twist control and tap mute functionality.  Highly recommended home or office speaker set
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,I'd give it a zero if that was an option. ,"Worked once, then quit. When hooked up to computer and turned on, a message pops up saying device detected, may not work properly. No lie. A complete waste of money"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Canon LK-51B Portabler Kit - Battery for Canon i90 printer,Order received fast and worked as expected.  Zero problems
electronics,,4.0,Things to consider if you're getting a 2GB card,"I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Product!,"It's very simple to operate, and considering the price it's a very nice radio..."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good Value,"Overall the headset works great, and the price is right.  Pro: The boom is long enough to be placed in front of your mouth, so there is no need to raise your voice to be heard.  Con: There isn't a volume control, or mute button on the headset"
electronics,,4.0,Cup Holder,"It's okay but my daughter doesn't like it.  I wish the size needed was the only size delivered.  The cords to the charger, and the car stereo adapter are too short that the Ipod can't sit in the 2nd row of seats cup holders"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"The Better prodcut,The webcam clarity is very good","The Webcam,mike and headset are good.the product in combination of these three is really a good one"
electronics,14 of 15,5.0,A great printer,"I have had more fun with this printer since I bought it 6 months ago than I can say... I am not so great with my computer but this little machine was sooo easy (I didn't even read the instructions)I have my little printing area and the best was at Christmas when I brought it (because I can) to my Mom and Dads and took a few photos of their grandkids and printed their copies 2 minutes later.. You should have seen my Dad's face when he realized the picture was from a few minutes before. The zoom in and center option gets rid of all the background stuff.. I get my adorable nephews and nieces faces close up and clear.. And the black and white feature is soooo awsome.. I am still amazed with this little machine.. One of the best ""toys"" I have bought for myself (since my cordless weedwacker) and now my sister and myself are getting one .. the printer.. as a gift for our sister in law.. Colleen"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Great product,"This is a great product and the perfect alternative to buying an installed GPS system.  In addition to its utility for local trips, it is incredibly valueable for business trips to new cities.  The local restaurant and points of interest database is really amazing."
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Good product,"I don't have any problem with the adapter and the sound quality is good. In my opinion, it deserves 4.5 stars. Actually most of the bad reviews here for this product are not fair. At least one should not complain about a product because he/she couldn't receive it from a retailer or received a wrong product. He/She should point his/her finger to the retailer, instead"
electronics,12 of 31,4.0,fully functional,What's to say?  They're paper sleeves for CD's ..
electronics,22 of 34,1.0,Way too expensive,This is nothing more than a VGA cable with different plugs. It is a rip off. Gold plated connectors or not. Use your compenent connections for near same quality image for one tenth the cost
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,handle with care,The product is fine I had problems with the shipment from 
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Range Extended but...,Worked great with external 9 dbi omni antenna but owner of network says it interferes with rest of network.  Not a technician so don't know that part - sure wish I did
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,I like this item!,It has greatly simplified what can be a daunting process - i.e. making sure everyone in the household can operate and enjoy a home theater system.  Programming was relatively easy and took maybe 1/2 hour for the initial setup
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,Excellent!,"Because I'm a free lance writer and reviewer, I often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when I'm direct quoting."
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,good review,I purchased the racing wheel for my 18 wheels of steel game the first one had a problem but amazon replaced it with no big problem the new wheel works very god with my truck gam
electronics,,5.0,Fantastic Deal!,"This was a fantastic deal for a large capacity external hard drive.  It worked perfectly with my Macintosh right out of the box.  This is a great way to backup your primary hard drive.  The drive includes with both USB 2.0 and FireWire connections.  I would highly recommend this hard drive for anyone looking for a quick, economical way to backup their data"
electronics,,4.0,it really rocks,simple setup
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,This is a good webcam but not the best one out there....,This webcam is good if not the best out there. It is very sleek and the picture quality is good but it's expensive and may not be worth the money spent on it
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,Awesome!,"I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. "
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,Slight problem....,"There are an adequate number of reviews for this product, so I will only comment on my great experience with Amazon.  "
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,"Great product, great price.","Excellent quality for its intended use. The price was unbelieveably low,. You can't beat either"
electronics,,4.0,Great product.  BUT,"I have nothing but great things about the Garmin RINO 120.  The Navigation is good to go.  Some people complain about how much more work it is compared to a dedicated GPS model.  Well, when you have to combine the radio and the GPS, there is bound to be some compromise somewhere.  The radio feature is great.  I got scambling security function, different beeps and tones for different parties, and the GPS location works with the radio.  "
electronics,,4.0,Monster FM Transmitter for my iPod,It is just what I was looking for. I had searched for a wireless transmitter that would also charge the battery. iPods are notorious for battery problems and I want to concerve as much as possible. The Monster was recommended to me by a friend and after reading about it on the internet I began the search for the best price. Once again I found that price on Amazon
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,good product but only lived a short life - 1 year,"It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least"
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,Lemon!,"I thought the notion of a portable was wonderful. I'm very sorry I purchased this particular unit. It never after the first week worked off the cradle (bad battery? On a new unit?). The unit keypad stopped working completely after a couple of weeks. In order to use this ""portable"", I have to have it cradled and use the remote--otherwise, I cannot use it away from home. "
electronics,,5.0,Easy install.  It works,"What more can you ask for.  The install was straight forward, and the toner works great.  I will on the other hand refill when the time comes, probably a year or longer the way I print."
electronics,,5.0,Logitech does a superb job with the Harmony 880,"I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database.  Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package.  In any event the process was hassle free and I  now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great.  (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.)  My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off.  However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again.  The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base.  Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880."
electronics,,4.0,works for me,this was my second hardrive I hooked up to my mac.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works Like Magic!,"After reading in several places that *water* was the best for cleaning your TV, I was reluctant to fork over the money for this kit (liquid and cloth).  But let me tell you--it was well worth it!  It is amazing how well it works.  Now that I have a two-year old, I get fingerprints, handprints, peanut butter--you name it--on the screen, and this stuff gets it right off like magic.  I use it to clean my computer screens too.  Unless you are completely obsessive, one bottle should last for a few years"
electronics,31 of 31,4.0,Better than Wizcom QuickLink Elite,"I'm measuring, first and foremost, ease and precision of scanning. Speed of scanning and ease of installation on the computer are, in my mind, about the same for both the Wizcom QuickLink Elite and the C-Pen 800C. They differ sufficiently, however, in the primary question of ease and quality of scanning. For the record, I bought both at the same time, with the intent of keeping the better of the two. You can just go ahead and buy the C-Pen 800C."
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,Vertical mount,Susposed to be capable of wall installation.  Isn't.  Handset will fall off if phone is more than one inch from upright
electronics,,4.0,"works all the time, what more can i say?","I am a new iPod owner and am constantly astonished at all the things there are to buy for my new toy! It's like a baby that needs a layette, bottles, diapers.... anyway, the first thing I bought was this wireless transmitter since I listen to my iPod in the car more than anywhere else. It defaults to 3 stations which all work fine for me since I live in a rural area. In fact I get great pleasure out of punching in the local religious-rant station, and then tuning in my iPod to Nine Inch Nails! Hee hee. Only a bit of a problem with static when driving into the Big City. I love that it also recharges the iPod. I've never run the battery down to zero."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Just what I wanted,I bought these as a gift for my husband to watch TV late at night without disturbing me.  He loves them.  The sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable. 
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,SanDisk is my frien:D,Bought this in 2005.  I use it almost every day to transport files to and from college.  I use it A LOT!  It has never given me any problems.  I throw it in my book bag and don't worry about it because the metal casing is pretty tough.  The only bad thing is that it takes a little work to get the keyring loop in the key slot.  No complaints on price or quality from me
electronics,13 of 21,1.0,Disappointed - returned this phone,I was very disappointed with this phone and decided to return it after having it less than one week.
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,burned by best buy,works as advertised....cost almost nothing. I just returned an equivilant to best buy...cost $35.00.... ridiculous. this cable appears to be of even better quality and transfer rate
electronics,3 of 6,5.0,Plantronics Cordless Headset Phone,So far I have been very happy with this product. I was very happy to find it at such a great price
electronics,3 of 6,4.0,Great XM Receiver,"I guess 'early adopter' from Denver is one of those that can't do a little research or bother to read the manual.  Installing the antenna OUTSIDE the car - what a concept!  Where did EA think the antenna would go?  You do need to have a 'clear view off the sky' for best reception (the antenna has to 'see' the satellite).  For example, don't expect to sit in the car in your garage/basement and listen to the radio.  You CAN select direct channels (unlike mentioned by EA).  If you want to go from channel 100 to 200, you just enter 200 with the number keys.  It does take a second or two for the radio to switch, unlike conventional radio, but that's a minor annoyance.  Take the dash out to install? - I don't want EA doing any work around my house.  This receiver is VERY easy to install.  Just mount it somewhere on the dash - I used velcro - run the power cord from a 12V source, run/mount the antenna, and you're done.  (Come on EA, do you work for a 'terrrestial' radio station losing market share to satellite radio?)  EA is correct in that the built-in FM 're-transmitter' is not that great.  I use the cassette adapter and play it through my built-in cassette deck.  Luckily my car has one, and the fidelity is very good."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best of all - I love it,"I got the product, nice packaging and excellent as you expect from Linksys."
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,No Problems at 16X so far,I bought a new 16X burner for my PC and have tried the 25pk Verbatim 4.7GB 16X DVD+R media on it.  I have not had any failures so far burning at 16X and the playback has been fine.  I have bought another 25pk of this media
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Buy Harmony 550 instead,I came close to buying the 360 model but I found out a few things. You might notice that the Xbox 360 harmony control looks a lot like the Harmony 550. Well it's because it's almost exactly the same thing. Here's the difference. The 550 has more buttons. The AXBY buttons on the Xbox model are dedicated to Xbox 360. 550 model has extra programmable buttons. The 550 is also in a different color. Also the 550 can control your 360 but allows you to control more devices. I seriously recommend this remote for replacing all your other remotes and you can read my full review of the harmony brand controllers under the 550
electronics,,5.0,17 year old loves it,I got this for my son and he loves it.  He quickly and easily downloads photos to his ipod.  He is definitely using his digital camera more these days
electronics,,4.0,Works Great,"The drive works as described.  No issues with connectivity or loss of data.  It is slightly bigger than some of the mini's but makes up for it with no hassle with extra ""programs"" on it.  It is just plug and play and works great.  I keep it on my keychain so it gets banged around a lot, and I've had zero problems"
electronics,1 of 16,1.0,Worthless Time Wasting Product,"If You are thinking of buying a Belkin Product DON'T.  There products are hard to find, and you will get conflicting information from their vendors.  This is what happened to me. I was told to order this product by a salesperson at Circuit City.  I went to Bestbuy, Radio Shack and then Circuit City to find it.  None of these stores had the product available.  I was told at Circuit City that this product would solve my problem by allowing me to charge my Belkin wireless FM Receiver which I purchased for Christmas for my Daughter from Costco.  The product didn't solve the problem.  I still have to buy batteries for the Belkin Wireless FM Receiver.  Which by the way uses quite a lot of them.  After all the time I spent trying to fix this Belkin Product I purchased a Sony Product online that was cheaper, easier to get and did the job better than any Belkin Product"
electronics,,5.0,Fufitsu Scansnap for Mac,"The ScanSnap is an excellent productivity tool.  It is very easy to set up and configure and requires minimal desktop space allowing it to be positioned within easy reach.  The scan quality is excellent for all scanning tasks but it excels at handling routine documents.  Now rather than mailing a filled in form or a document requiring signature, I can convert them to PDF and immediately return them to the sender by email.  Receipts, invoices and bills no longer need to be filed but now can be converted to PDF and stored.  Rather than taking heavy stacks of papers for reading while traveling, I can quickly and easily convert them to PDF.  The ScanSnap has changed the way I work and I continue to find new applications for it every day"
electronics,,5.0,Best Fax Machine I have Used,I bought this machine based on reviews from a number of users.  We have used it for almost two years and it has functioned perfectly.  I especially like the scan then send feature.  We often load several documents at once to different phone numbers and just let it crank away.  Never a problem.  It is not cheap but it is professional grade. 
electronics,,4.0,Great sound good value,Well worth the price - if you're looking for light mob ile headphones these are it
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Wonderful sound and easy to connect,"I have always had Panasonic stereo equipment and when I decided to get a new receiver looked at this model.  The sound is amazing I am using it with a 100 W surround system.  Works great for TV, DVD and even with my iTunes wireless set-up.  The sound is so much better than the older system and there is an almost endless number of adjustments you can make to get the sound just right.  With my music classical, pop or vocals all sound great!  Recommended highl"
electronics,,1.0,Be Warned!,"These Xtreme cd cases STINKs,literally! I don't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic, but the smell is absolutely nauseous. I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away. Nope. Finally I threw it away. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 - Multi Media Speakers,"Overall, I am satisfied with the sound of the system for the size and price.  The bass reproduction is very good, but I was hoping for a little better performance on the high frequency response.  Rate it 4 out of 5"
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,OK at first,"These were decent at first, with the downside being the bass had no power. Even without decent bass the mid-high range was very clear so for $14 or so these were an OK purchase. About a month later the speakers are crackling on certain frequencies, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy a high end headphone so I could trash these. The annoying thing is that Sony even bothered to waste any time or materials building these."
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,No Unlock Code Was Provided,"Extreme hassle getting it to unlock without the code, it was not provided with the product. I have nearly $1000 invested in GPS and maps, too much money to cram in Garmin's ....trash. I'm stuck with it."
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,Well Pleased,"cost is low because the company no longer exists - no tech support, no company website (just be prepared)"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Convenience at a good price,"I was looking for a small, convenient charger for my son's iPod mini.  This product is exactly as described.  The price was right and delivery was extremely fast.  I would definietly recommend buying this product"
electronics,21 of 21,5.0,Quality Product & Ease of Use,"After losing a computer to a power surge, I purchased the APC BE500R Back-UPS for my new computer.  I am runninig a 3.2Ghz Tower PC with a 17"" LCD Monitor, I have approx. 15 minutes of Battery Runtime on my system, & the software that is very easy to install & manage, saves any open programs that I am running & safely shuts down my computer when the battery gets to within 5 minutes of running out of power if I am away from it.  Money Well Spent!  You don't need to spend a fortune on Larger units unless you want a longer runtime on Battery"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent office tool.,I purchased this headset along with the Plantronics A20 headset amplifier/accessory deck and HL10 automatic handset lifter. Highly recommend this combination of products if you spend a lot of time on the phone. 
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,A Great Audiophile Bargain,The Sony SCD-CE595 has to be one of the great audiophile bargains of all time.  I got it for $120 through Amazon and it is replacing a $3000 CD playback system.  
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Mostly satisfied for my expectations,"The sound quality is slightly worse than my six-year-old Uniden EXI8966.  It's not always noticeable.  Some times I couldn't tell any difference in the sound quality between the two.  Other times, more obvious buzz and hum here and there.  The ringer is the same four-pattern type as my old Uniden, two different tones with high and low volume versions for each.  But they are definitely not as loud as the old Uniden..."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Hi Fidelity Sound Jukebox!,"I am new to the iPod ""lifestyle"".  Man, talking about a lot of peripherals one can use with the iPod.  I have the new 80 GB video unit.  I have a Kensington docking station hooked up to my stereo system with a Yamaha receiver and Definitive Technology surround speakers and I believe this system rivals it in a compact way.  The Bose system is for those wanting hi fidelity sound from a compact, simple, modern unit.  No, you cannot hook up anything else to this unit, buy why would you?  The power cord is a two part unit, bulky in some respects but hey, this unit requires power in order to give you its great sound.  As for the sound,  I believe it covers the lows, mids, highs very accurately.  I listen to everything from classical to techno to rock and it sounds great.  Clarity is outstanding (simply, listen to the breathing that vocals require and you will actually hear them clearly).  Not to mention with the volumn turned up... way up... there is very little if any distortion.  Another way I value something like this is pick it up, its weight is heavy which in my opinion equals sound construction and longevity.  As for other systems, Altec Lansing etc. (listened to as well)  they are less expensive but why?  Turn their volumns up and find out the difference.  Compare and contrast as I did and make your decision based on want/need.  So, if you are wanting... needing a great sounding ""hi fidelity jukebox"", cool style, worthy of any room in the house, then this is your ticket to a personalized concert. Also plan on having it for while, because I believe its style and construction will outlast any other ""trendy"" unit this system is compared to which also means a great value over the long term.       "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,earbuds,The earbuds sound great but I have a problem keeping the little rubbery ends on. They are always sliding around and are never in position. It is a pain to keep turning them back in place every single time I put them on
electronics,,5.0,"Not the easiest to set up, but worth the effort!","After doing some research, I purchased the Stowaway Bluetooth Keyboard for my HP iPAQ 6515 (Pocket PC).  As others had stated, it was not the easiest to setup and I had to play with it for quite a while until I got it to work.  The directions are not very clear and you really do need to have a good working knowledge of your device to get it up and running.  Also, don't look for support from the company, there really is none.  However, now that it is syncronized, it works great!  The keyboard is easy to use (full-size) and although you have to hold down the function key to type numbers, I quickly got used to it.  It opens and closes easily and my Pocket PC immediately recognizes that the keyboard is there with just a touch of the first key.  Overall it is a great product and my only complaint is that I did not purchase it when I first bought my Pocket PC.  I use is for work, class, and even pull it out to type e-mails when I am out on the go.  Thanks to this keyboard, I have a full computer in my purse at all times.  The product has made my life a hundred times easier, so if you are being cheap as I was at first, don't!  It is worth the $100 and then some, just prepare to spend an hour or two installing it . . ."
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Configuration is big task,I bought the product 2 weeks before and I have a thought this will work with all printers but not. D Link technical support is very bad I called at least 10 times to find my printer is compatible or not. 
electronics,6 of 7,2.0,Unusable: volume too low and pinches my ear,"On the positive side, the headset is extremely lightweight, and I'm told by people that I've called that the sound quality is very good. Unfortunately, I found the headset unusable for my needs for two reasons. First, the earloop pinches my ear and I can only wear the headset for about 30 minutes before it becomes unbearably painful. Second, I could only use it in very quiet environments because the volume of the earpiece is too low. I would recommend this headset only if you have very small ears and plan to use it in the quietest surroundings"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Best Remote I have ever owned!,"I have owned this remote for over a year now, so I have really put it through the test.  During this period, I changed TVs, receivers, and DVD players, and each time the online interface tool was simple and flawless in helping step me through the process.  I also changed computers, going from a PC to a Mac, and found the software works equally well on both platforms.  "
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Best photo paper out there!,This is by far the best photo paper out there! Colors look great! The surface is superb! I use this paper with my Canon i850 and it's fabulous... try this paper and it will be the only paper that you will ever want to use with your inkjet!
electronics,5 of 8,4.0,.Net is not spyware,"Sorry - i have to make a comment here. .NET is a programming framework for creating applications.  It does not communicate and send info to Microsoft, unless Ideazone created the app to do so.  Which I doubt it did, considering that it would be a gross invasion of privacy"
electronics,6 of 13,2.0,Not as good as Memorex HP2000,"If you are looking for an inexpensive headset. . .try the Memorex HP2000. The HP2000 sounds superior to the Sony MDR-XD100 with much better bass response and has a volume and Mono/Stereo switch built into the cord. I use them in my home studio, not for mixing but for the musicians and vocalist to hear themselves. They are hard on headsets so I don't want to spend a pile of dough on them. The earcups get ripped off easily and the plugs eventually break but at $14.95. . .what the heck"
electronics,1 of 17,5.0,To Mac Or Not To Mac,"Those of you who are pouting that this is an overprized Mac accessory aren't clearly not Mac people --- and for that reason, you probably don't own an Ipod, either (and another brand's comprable MP3 player)."
electronics,14 of 18,4.0,Very Good System...minus a couple of points,Had this system for a week now. Almost Everything is great. The only complaints is that I cannot get the caller ID to work on the 2nd line. Panasonic is no help...just a generic trouble shoot from them. The other item is the display of all the missed calls. Besides that it is a good system so far??
electronics,3 of 10,5.0,"Great listening, don't drop in yer coffee!!","I had a great time at the office using these little incognito ear buds. One day, I need to keep an ear out for the phone and somehow I dropped one of the ear buds in my coffee. I tried to dry it out, but to no avail. it is now crackly and sounds bad. I guess I will buy another set!"

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Killer DVDs...No Flubs and a Great Value,"Having used several top brands (Ritek, Memorex, imation, Leda, Optodisc, etc.) before, I would say the Verbatim DVD-Rs are the most consistently good blank DVD media I've come across.  I use them for data, photos, movies, and music - never a problem yet.  And in the 100 stack, they were priced at or below what I found for mosty other branded DVDs.  I have to recommend the Verbatim DVD-Rs, no doubt about it"
electronics,7 of 10,1.0,Horrible remote problems,"This unit worked fine for about a month and then suddenly the remote became extremely sluggish. We now have to press any button 3 to 5 times before it will register. After trying all the troubleshooting tips and researching the problem online, we discovered from other users that this problem was not uncommon."
electronics,15 of 18,4.0,Dependable product but greatly overpriced with inflated ego.,"These interconnects work perfectly fine and if you want capable yet expensive looking cables then buy these. However, any standard RCA cable with reasonable shielding will give you exactly the same audio reproduction."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,"Beautiful sound, and quite affordable","I am not an expert as much as the others posting here, all I know is that my original iPod earbuds were quite uncomfortable. I replaced them with this Sportapro and played Joni Mitchell's ""Hejira' on my iPod and it sounded STELLAR."

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Comfy,"After spending some time searching for a new mouse I decided on this model. I  work with 3ds Max, so having a mouse that was comfortable and compatible with that program was a must. The scroll will is smooth, but I do have some problems with it with some programs where a click wheel would work better. Also the middle mouse button is stiff and hard to press. I am hoping that it will eventually become easier to push as the mouse becomes worked-in. "

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Worth it,"I bought this case for all my DVDs to save shelf space. So far I have about 175 in there and although its a little heavy and bulky it still beats having shelves of dvds in their cases. Taking the pages in and out is a bit of a pain in the ass (you can only do it from the front) so if thats a big selling point for you, you may want to look else where. By far my favorite feature though is the front cover has an insert where you can store 16 Dvds/cds and can be removed and becomes a very handy travel case. The folder is also very sturdy and has nice leather. I throw it around all the time withou fear of it falling apart or hurting the contents"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Really a bit rubbish,"Doesn't work. Really unacceptable lag on the functions even in plain line of sight. Even the Mac updated software V1.0.4 is woefully inadequate, no way to configure in any way other than 'Hacking' using Applescript (Tedious process - frankly, life's too short). OK, I thought I'd give it to my friend to control his PC iTunes with, from one room away (about 20 feet). The thing actually doesn't work from about 8 feet away when slighty round the corner of a bookshelf. Maybe wood to RF is like lead shielding is to Kryptonite - I don't know. This thing is pitiful. I'm taking it back and getting something that fits my only criterion: That it should work."

electronics,2 of 11,4.0,Ipod Mini ordeal,"I bought 2 ipods mini (one for me -blue- and one for my wife -green-)At 6 months the blue one completely died (apple sent me a new one without charge -great!)Six months later the battery died so I use the blue one as a hard disk or connected to a JBL device to play it.  My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare). It says ""out of power"" even though I fully chraged it for hours. I found out that if i hit the device it would start again. As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way. I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated. I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again. If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson: US$700"

Belkin's equipment is so much more reliable, it does what you ask it to and doesn't flinch like inferior DLINK and LINKSYS products."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,XM Extension Cable,"Was thrilled to see the 50 foot XM extension cable.  The cable that was included with our XM radio was way too short for our small house, I don't know why they didn't include a longer one in the kit."
electronics,7 of 10,5.0,Top Notch Cable,"This is a great video cable, though it's very spendy. Superior to composite & S Video. Monster classifies it as &quot;ultimate performance&quot;. I'd say only DVI & HDMI, which are both digital, are better. I needed a 2M or 6.5' cable because the 1M was just too short for my needs. I looked at this one (90$) and Monster's new THX Ulta 1000 4' component cable(100$). They had equal features. The THX cable is better looking than this one, however when it came down to it I didn't want to spend 10 extra bucks on a cable that's 2.5' shorter! Now this cable isn't THX certified, but it is certified by Imaging Science Foundation. I typically recommend Monster Cable, I feel they are the leader in A/V cables. This is a great fit for a progressive scan DVD player and/or HDTV. Get the most out of what you paid for! Rock On."
electronics,,1.0,Reached Capacity after 24 MB,"Everything has been working fine until six months and 24mb storage bites later, my Kingston 512MB DataTraveler says it's full every time I try to store Word documents. Mind you, it says I have 488 MB remaining so you can imagine how frustrating this experience is. I'll have to buy another flash drive, maybe a SanDisk."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great and inexpensive little radio,I purchased the Grundig FR200 Emergency Radio (Yellow)to use when we go camping. I was surprised at how well it received AM and FM stations. For the price you can't go wrong with this little radio. The crank is somewhat fragile since it is a small plastic device. I think it will hold up if I am careful not to horse it. It picks up short wave stations although I hardly ever listen to them. If you're looking for a dependable radio that won't break the bank then this is an excellent choice
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,decent radio,"I have been using this radio for close to 2 years now and am now getting two more of those radios on request of my family members.  The radio has both high FM and AM sensitivity, comparable to that for a dedicated tuner in an audio system.  The power consumption is low.  The sound quality is very good and becomes excellent, for a small radio, if you upgrade the headphones.  I have used both Koss KSC50 and Sony DR-G250DP.  The latter come with a concealable microphone boom and take care both of my radio and on-the-road computer needs"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,IPOD cup holder,great produce.
electronics,16 of 16,5.0,Simply the Best!,"IF ... you are looking for the cleanest, most portable sound you can find.  It's not loud, but it is oh so clear.  And, it is VERY small and light.  If you have an iPod Mini you HAVE to get this because it sits on your night stand taking up no space charging your docked Mini as it plays. I use mine with an iAudio G3. Best of all it can also run on four AA batteries. I looked high and low for a little system to take camping and to the beach.  This one has no equal for that.  If you want bigger, louder sound go for the round, much larger and heavier inMotion7.  It blows Bose and JBL away and costs less.   But if you want true portability, this one has no equal.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Burned all 10 in Pinnacle,"I burned all 10 successfully with bug-infested Pinnacle 9 using my Vaio, whereas I had had a 40% coaster rate with some Infiniti discs. Tried the resulting movies on a variety of DVD players and it worked on them all except the very oldest"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Great notebook case,"This case is great for value and for space..for the most part. It's actually really hard to find a good value leather case for a 15.4 notebook, but this was it. Unfortunately though not much room for any other types of peripheral, ie notebook mouse, once my adaptor and power cord went in, as nothing else but my notebook fits in that compartment so they had to go in another, but all in all, really nice case, and not too heavy being leather either. Another good point ladies is that its looks are relatively unisex, not too masculine but not too feminine either. Highly recommended"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Excellent Printer; VERY ANNOYING Messages re: Ink Cartridges,"I have no complaints about the output I receive from this new all-purpose Canon Printer.  What I find VERY ANNOYING, however, are the frequent error messages about the various ink cartridges, all of which are Canon brand.  Without warning, I will receive error messages, for example, that the printer detects more than one ""magenta"" cartridge, when, in fact, there is only one magenta cartridge.  I then remove the ""blinking"" magenta cartidge and place it back in the appropriate magenta printer cartridge slot.  Sometimes, the same error message immediately reappears.  Other times, I immediately receive another error message about another cartridge being, either missing or present more than once.  Sometimes, the printer works fine.  If I receive an error message, I immediately remedy the problem and then hope for the best.  This is increasingly annoying and definitely detracts from my overall satisfaction with the printer.  I contacted Canon phone support about this and their response is to send me replacement ""magenta"" and ""black -No. 5"" cartridges. While I appreciate receiving the new cartridges, this will not remedy the underlying problem.  If others have had this problem, please write a review, especially if there is a solution!"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Line in WAV recording - Uncompressed Audio - Live Recording,OK. There are only TWO units that support the line in WAV file
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Better than average printer,"I like how it has the tray to insert 4x6 paper for printing photos, makes it very easy, also, if i dont use the printer for a day or two i need to clean the nosels before using it but doent take long and always get good prints after that. Good inexpensive printer, makes good prints. the ink usually costs $40-50 for both cartrages but i am a graphic designer and it does everything i need without having to buy a very expensive printer."
electronics,19 of 21,5.0,Great Speaker For The Price,"Typical ceiling speakers from known respected brands all had great sound but a hefty price tag to match.  This speaker carried a middle of the road price for a pair, and packed quite a punch once it was installed.  I have been very pleased with the overall performance in my home.  It has been a nice addition, and is fabulous for entertaining"

Called Eangler several times, they promised to correct the problem but never has. Eangler or Amazon will never get my business again"
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Don't worry about the on button!,"I just bought a Geko 201 after using one that my friend let me borrow for a few weeks. My friend's unit had a protruding power button that admittedly was easy to push by accident. I decided to purchase one anyway for it's size, price, and convenience. I figgured that I would just be careful and remove the batteries when there was a chance that the button would get pressed. When mine arrived I was surprised to find that the 201 has been redesigned. The power button has been recessed and there is now a small ridge around it to protect against the accidents that have been outlined in many other reviews. I would highly recommend this GPS"

electronics,,4.0,Best Cheap Antenna I've Owned,"Through the years we have had five or six of these amplified antennas.  We just want to see the local channels better.  We don't have cable or HD or anything fancy.  Well, this one actually improves the reception better than all the others we've owned.  It may not work for everyone, but here in Minneapolis, it's pretty darned good.  Not perfect (thus the four stars) but pretty darned good.  I'd get this again"
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,Buyer Beware,"Purchased this monitor directly from Viewsonic.  First monitor I received had a dead pixel in the center of the screen.  Closer inspection showed that this monitor was likely previously returned before it was sent to me.  Called viewsonic and told them that I had a dead pixel, expecting them to take care of it no problem.  Oh no, I had to pay to send it back.  In other words, I had to pay for them to replace a defective monitor that was likely previously returned for the same reason.  Finally, convinced them under threat of taking it to the Dept. of Consumer Affairs that they would cover shipping.  Received another monitor out of the original packaging with several dead pixels in the right corner.  Called again.  ""Sorry our policy says that the monitor can have up to 7 dead pixels and we consider it in perfect shape.""  Will not return it.  And obviously sent me two previously returned monitors.  My opinion:  These are not people you want to deal with.  They are pushing bad merchandise and making it as hard as possible to return it.  I strongly recommend Amazon provide this notice to their buyers"

electronics,,2.0,not exactly match fit for the gen 2 nano,"This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the ""hold"" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano"

If the answer is yes, you want to buy this calculator.  I initially purchased the Casico 750 (a bit better than the TI 83) and now I find myself (in the middle of my second year of my engineering degree) finally breaking down to buy the TI 89 instead.  Other reviews point to why this calculator stands out from the rest, all I wish to add is: avoid purchasing something cheaper for the engineer, you may only regret it later (like I did)"

electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Awesome quality!!!,"Some say digital cables dont need to be high quality since only 1's and 0's go through it, not an analog signal. Well if you buy a low quality cable you won't even get all the 1's and 0's and will have a lower quality digital picture. So quality does matter. I bought an HDMI-DVI cable for about $15. It was stepped on while moving some furniture around and it is now worthless. I then got a $30 one from a brand claiming to be as good as Monster Cable. That one did not even work out of the box! So I returned it, bought this cable and have been happy ever since."

Furthermore, I've had one refill ink permanently clog the tank, and the printer as well, until I performed deep cleanings on the printer with a squirt or two of alcohol.

I'd reccommend this accessory along with the Monster iPlay Plus for a clean looking, cost effective car audio solution without needing to hardwire it in"
electronics,40 of 40,4.0,Great Device but not perfect,"The first thing you'll probably notice about this player is it's gorgeous widescreen. How big is it? Well, technically speaking it's 480 x 272 resolution, 4.3 inches wide diagionally, and capable of displaying about 262,000 colors(same as Zen M). For those of you who now own a Zen M, to illustrate how big the screen is on the Zen W: You can lay an entire Zen M on the Zen W, and the entire area of the Zen M is about the size of the screen of the Zen W. For you Psp owners out there, the Zen W screen is exactly the same resolution and size as the screen on the PSP. Although, the PSP screen is actually more advanced and can display over 16 million colors. Though both of these screens are much better than the screen on the video Ipods(which is only 320 x 240, and only display 65,000 colors). The screen on the Zen W does the job very well, and you can adjust the brightness levels. Even at %50 brightness, it's adequate. Though it outshines the Zen M in screen size, I noticed that it's not quite as sharp and the colors are not as vivid as on the Zen M. Also, I noticed that while playing Divx video, the Zen W doesn't play the video as smoothly as on a computer. The video frame-rate seems to look more jerky and less smooth. Although the pre-installed videos looked fine in Xvid, so this may only apply to Divx videos. Some other great features about the player are it's built in FM radio, voice recorder, custom sound equalizer, built in speaker, and Compact Flash slot. The built-in speaker can get surprisingly loud and is adequate for watching videos... But if you're an Audiophile, it's not good for listening to your music. It's sounds quite tinny and is only a single speaker. One huge improvement over the Zen M is that you no longer need to carry a stupid adapter to charge or upload songs or media. The mini-usb power, and A/V out ports are already built in to this player. Also the magnesium casing seems much sturdier than the Zen M's plastic casing... and probably not as prone to scratches. The thing looks and feels very solidly built. The interface is also simple and easy to figure out and very similar to the Zen M interface."

If you recorded something on August 9th and it's November 4th, you're gonna be holding the back button on the recorder for a long... long... long time. Other than that I think it's great.

electronics,,4.0,Excellent headphones - Good mic,"I was using a pair of stereo headphones for music and a separate mono (single ear) headset for voice recognition. Switching between them was inconvenient. I thought this headset would be good for both. The headphone sound quality is excellent. The microphone is good but has more hiss than the one I was using. For voice recognition with Dragon Naturally Speaking Preferred V9, the extra hiss doesn't matter and the mic works as good as the other one I had. For recording speech the hiss from this mic is noticeable so I use my old headset for recording speech. I record Bible verses to play on my MP3 player so I can memorize them (Psalm 119:11). The headset comfort is good. Not great, but not bad either. Overall I'm happy with this unit. The price is very reasonable"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Quality and Affordable Price,"I purchased this monitor as an upgrade to a 17"" CRT I have had for years.  The picture quality is wonderful.  It's sharp, bright and has no dead pixels.  After using a widescreen monitor for gaming, I will have a hard time ever going back to regular size.  Not to mention being able to have two IE or Firefox browser windows open side-by-side."
electronics,7 of 7,1.0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","I adore my nano, but this armband is one of the worst products I have ever bought.  I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout.  The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body.    It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is.  I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent Quality plus Lots Of Room,"As you probably know these labels are for the Dymo label printers.  This labels are absolutely perfect.  I'm using the Dymo 330 Turbo and they work just great.  The quality of the labels is excellent.  Plus they have enough room for the address of the person I'm sending to as well as my return address.  There is even room for a graphic.  I used this on my Christmas cards and put a picture of Santa on the label.  The shipping from Office Max was a little steep...!  Proably would have cost less overall if I ordered them directly from Dymo.  Either way, the labels are great"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Garmin gps 60cs,"This handheld gps is awesome. I recently purchased this device and the topo Canada maps for a fishing trip. The map downloaded easy and were easy to use. I traveled over a hundred miles on the water, small stream, and portages. I never once had a reception problem even under a fairly heavy canopy. The bread crum feature was great and was eay to mark waypoints. The color screen is ten times better than the gray. It made the maps easy to read in the sun light and the topo maps stood out more. The battery lasted about 18-20 hours. I highly recommend this unit for hiking,camping and fishing"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Great Review,The unit provides crystal clear phone service in conjunction with a DSL and WiFi system. It does what it says it does. It is well worth the price
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Stunning,"This is my first Widescreen, HDTV or LCD television and I did extensive research prior to purchase."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works Great for HDTV. Works great with ON  DEMAND!,"Comcast digital service suffered from weak signal. Could see very few HDTV channels. Called Comcast and they had no solution. Was going to change service vendors when I saw the booster item. At that price (circa $40) it was a no brainer. Was concerned by earlier posts that the unit quit working or that ON Demand did not function properly. However, I am happy to say the unit resolved the weak signal issues, and works fine with ON Demand. Concerning the quitting issue, I would say the charger appears to be the units weakest link. Hopefully it can be replaced without having to purchase an entire new unit if and when the time comes"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,WOW!!,"The title of this review says it all.  I still can't believe the massively great sound that this little baby puts out.  I was originally looking for a nice set of headphones for my MP3 player, but now, they've become my standard set for my home theatre.  My friend had recommended these to me about a week before I bought them, and man was he right about one thing; GREAT BASS! These phones really show me how far technology has come these days.  It really DOES sound like 2 little 1&quot; subs next to your ears.  Not only is the bass amazing, but every little treb and mid is easily recognizable with amazing clarity.  I plan to use these as long they'll still function, and then I'll just buy another pair.  Great job Koss"
electronics,,5.0,SD on the go,"This is a great product for those who need to transfer files from a digital camera without the hasle of software. Its easy and quick. I use it every chance i get, and it fits in your pocket, what more can you ask for :"
electronics,,4.0,great timing no problems at all,"pefect timing, product brand new, you get what you pay, all involved, 5 star"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Wrong Item Shipped,"Ordered the Creative Labs WebCam Instant and paid quickly, but received the wrong item.  Shipping was fast, but item was wrong.  Girlfriend received the Logitech QuickCam Chat webcam instead and showed poorer quality.  Was really unsatisfied, but didn't want to hassle with sending item back.  Sorry for responding so late.  Will NOT be ordering from again"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,"Nice, Quick and Huge Space",Ideal for who is out of space and enjoys downloading videos from internet. That's the right place to store and to backup itens. I recommend!
electronics,9 of 13,1.0,Forgive  my typos-I'm using it now!!,"  If I could give this a zero star rating, I would. I've always like Logitech's mouse products, but this keyboard is terrible!The media keys have a cheap look to them, but more importantly, the regular keys are all scrunched together. Just typing this, I look like I'm playing the world's smallest piano. The home/delete/end keys are not in their standard configuration, and the delete key is now 'conveniently' the same size as 'enter' and 1/8"" apart. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,great with modifications,"sound is good, much better range and response than stock ipod ones.  noise cancelling is good for the price.  but i took one look at the rubber ear plugs that this thing came with and saw trouble.  easy to lose.  and they didn't seem to fit my ear so well."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A Perfect Companion For A PlayStation Portable,"I originally bought this for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) system. I wanted to listen to music and watch videos with the PSP, and the included 32mb stick could hold all of 3 songs. A 2gb Memory Stick is more than enough to hold even full movies and a bunch of music albums."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,A definite must have for iPod owners!,"When you use the video function on your iPod it depletes the battery pretty quick. I can keep this nifty little gadget with me and juice up my iPod anytime I want. Great product, I highly recommend it"
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,thank you for fixing my cd player!!!,"this product is awesome.  like another reviewer , i had a problem with my cd player playing my homemade mix cds.   but i used this cleaner and 30 seconds later everything is perfect!!!  thanks"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excelent Mouse... Great battery life,"i just recently aquired this mouse, and i got to say i love it. I do a lost of graphic designs and so im using the mouse constantly. i see almost everyone is complaining the bettery are not lasting long. maybe its just my luck of the draw, but i have not charged my battery in the past 2 days and its still got about 38% life left.. overall its an excelent mouse and i would recomend it to everyone."
electronics,,5.0,It reads em all,"This is a nice product,i buught it beacause i needed to play DVDs from foreign country and my fancy ""sony"" dvd vcr player can't read them but this little thing can,it reads all the standards i'm glad i've got it. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,better than the others,"Because it's on a cord and not a cradle, you can pick it up and actually see what you're playing on the Ipod.  "
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Pretty Nice,The CD Wallet is very nice. All of my dvd's fit perfectly in its pockets. I especially love having a zipper so you can keep all your disk kept in the wallet
electronics,,5.0,Car stereo,"So far the item has worked excellent. It looks very nice and was inastallation friendly. I hope you keeep this item, as I restore a lot of cars and this unit works well for me, and is at a good price point."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,SanDisk Sansa 1GB MP3 player,"The software provided with the unit worked well, I bought another mp3 player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer.  The menus are easy to use, and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the Sansa MP3 player will automatically shut off if you don't hit the play button again.  My only complaint is the unit eats a lot of batteries- it is best to go with rechargables.  I get about 6 hrs playback time per battery."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,"Many CDs skip, most CD-Rs skip; short battery life","I also received this as a Christmas gift. We quickly found out about the short battery life in Paris. Fortunately I had a 240/50-to-110/60 AC/DC adapter. Also, it is very bad at playing CD-Rs that I have created and which play fine on a 1995 model Magnavox portable CD player (!). It has less trouble with regular pre-recorded CDs"
electronics,1 of 5,1.0,Targus PA400U DEFCON 1 Ultra Notebook Computer Security System,"I had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period, the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Sound for the price!,"I read all of the reviews on Amazon several times and compared them to other reviews on other brands. I chose these because most of the reviews stated the great sound quality for the money and they did not lie! I also read how heavy they were but after strapping these babies on and started to listen, I completey forgot about that small problem. Believe me, it's a great payoff! The only thing I can complain about is the fact that I am into metal music. I listen to everything from Iron Maiden to Shadow's Fall and needless to say you cannot listen to this type of music on the same level as Kenny G. My stereo is in the same room with our large TV/DVD/VCR and when I'm listening to my music, at a moderate volume setting, my wife and daughter will complian they can hear my music bleeding through. Maybe someone has some suggestions to help with this. Anyway, they are well worth the small investment! Get these if you want some great sounding headphones. You will join me in placing your other brands of headphones in your next garage sale"
electronics,4 of 9,5.0,A lot cheaper than apples AC Charger ,"Apples ""ACCESSORY"" the ac adaptor doesn't even come with a USB cable and IT cost $30 when it should be free. This charger is a lot cheaper but I don't like buying stuff that should be free for my Ipod Video"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Mine works fine with Tivo Series2,"Dispite seeing many reviews on here that said this product does not work with Series2, I decided to buy it based on a few success stories, and the fact that Tivo recommends this one. It looks like the March update fixed it.  Mine is working just fine.  The Tivo detected it, and all is well."
electronics,,5.0,Great Mouse For the price,"As far as computer accessories go I have found that the term ""you get what you pay for"" applies a lot. I don't think you can find a better optical mouse for the price anywhere, I love this mouse I'm on my second one but only because I accidentally severed the cord! GREAT BUY!!"
electronics,36 of 38,5.0,"Makes Fabulous Photos, Greeting Cards & Calendars","After getting the Canon i960 printer, I had to try this paper.  One it was cheap.  And two, the diverse reviews here intrigued me to no end.  After making a few prints on this paper, I began to think I knew why the paper was so cheap...it was THAT bad!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Same as the rest!,"I can tell no difference in these batteries opposed to the high end. No more high priced dept. store batteries for me! As far as the electrogalaxy deal I have no idea, but these are sold thru Amazon"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Only one so far to fit 700M with Extended Battery!,"I have tried various cases to help protect my Dell 700M laptop.  I first tried the Elecom Zeroshock case because of its superior protection (made from memory foam.) This case had two major problems: 1. It was way to stiff, so it did not have any ""give"" and 2. It was a bit too small.  When you combine these two problems (and pop an extended battery on your 700m) you get one EXTREMELY snug case, so snug that the black from the case was actually rubbing off onto the white trimming of the 700M (thanks Elecom.) So then I decided to try a neoprene case but before settling on the Vaio case above, I tried the Marware Sportfolio.  It fit wonderfully, unfortunately it fit wonderfully without the extended battery.  Also, the Sportfolio is more of an all-in-one carry-it-with-you-looks-like-a-briefcase type case.  But unlike a briefcase, this thing was small, didn't have space to put the charger, and was surprisingly impractical.  Plus, I wanted something that could fit inside my backpack and basically keep it  a little protected plus scratch-free.  So finally, I desperately came to amazon.com typed in ""neoprene case"" and found this gem (thanks to other reviewers who praised it's ability to fit their 700m.)"
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Too much static for data use,We've tried several different outlets and cannot find a combination that doesn't give us a buzzing in the background.  The static is great enough that we cannot use it for modem or fax machines.  Beware
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,I waited to review this...,"...until some time had passed, based on others' original good first impressions deteriorating after a bit of time, because of breakage, annoyance, problems with resetting and reception, etc.  Well, I have had the remote for over two months now and I think it's (still) just great.  I love the radio option and the remote lets me stash the Pod safely in my bag on my commute.  Only relative negative I've noted is having to retrieve said safely stowed Pod to switch between radio and hard drive access modes, which, for the most part, is no big deal.  I do wish the iPods originally came with installed radio access, such as can be found on the Creative Zen Micro (my previous player), but this radio/remote helps fill in that gap"
electronics,5 of 7,4.0,"Lots to like, but worth it??","I used to own a pair of these headphones and I fell in love with the in-ear design for the way it isolates the sound better than any other headphone form factor. It even keeps outside noise out better than even the big cup-style headphones since the rubber end literally sits inside your ear canal, and also stays attached to your head better than any other style of headphone - you can do cartwheels with these on and they won't fall off! This design is the real magic behind the sound quality since the sound is pumped directly into your noggin with no outside interference."
electronics,,5.0,Best deal ever,"You simply can't go wrong for 5 bucks. Product arrived in new condition. Hooked up in PCI slot, and presto, I was transferring videos from my canon mini dv camcorder in less than 10 mins."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Good product,"These are very comfortable to wear, and the sound is great.  I use them out jogging, and they stay put, without any pressure on the ear.  The tight fit blocks out any outside noise, so be careful around traffic, as you cannot hear cars.  I would highly recommend these to anyone"
electronics,,1.0,Netgear WG311 54 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter,The absolute worst product.  Stay away!!  There have been zero days that i have not had a problem witht this adapter.  I get the Windows BSOD EVERYDAY.  Went out and bought the Linksys equivalent and have not had any problems thus far.
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,"Sweet bargain, great performance","I got this HDMI cable for under $10 just to see whether it will work as well as the expensive ones and it was well worth the risk.  I tested it with my upconverting LG DVD player on 1080i resolution on my 42"" 1080p Westinghouse LCD TV and it works just like any other HDMI cable, including those loud names who charge you ten-fold for ""golden plated extra special micro gravity nanotechnology space age wireless high conductivity low noise extra gauge supercalafragilisticexpialidocious"" cables with no difference in performance. By buying this cable I avoided the huge ""naive citizen tax"" included in these products. Considering its price, this is an amazingly good cable"
electronics,5 of 12,1.0,No go for DVD-ROM,"This player do not play DVD-ROM. This is strange since most burners would set the book type of your DVD to DVD-ROM to ensure compatibility with most DVD players. Interestingly, Philips decided not to ensure that this player is comptible with the common book type."
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,piece of junk,I too had a Sony for YEARS and replaced it with this radio. Big mistake- even when I buy brand new batteries they are dead. Literally the low battery light flashes and all I get is static.  Save your self the money and don't buy this hunk of junk
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Brother Quality Continues to Impress,"This makes my third Brother laser printer that I have owned over the years.  All three printers continue to be operational despite heavy workloads that I put on them in my small business.  In fact, the only reason I bought the 2070N was because I wanted the convenience of the built-in networking capabilities.  When it comes to quality, Brother shined above all the others and continues to do so."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"doesn't fit all models, didn't fit mine!",It's a great mount but I ordered it as a package deal with a model Nuvi 350 GPS and it won't work with that model.... returned it!!
electronics,,5.0,Great item.,"If you follow the included instructions, this print server is very easy to set up.  I have had it for about six months now, and it has not given me any problems at all.  I am looking at it on Amazon again, because I am recommending it to a friend"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,A product to avoid if you own a Palm Treo 650,Here is a quick writeup of the issues I've had with this product AND the support people:
electronics,18 of 18,5.0,GREAT!,"I bought these t-shirt transfers after wasting time, money and t-shirts using other brands and even the Avery brand for white t-shirts were horrible. They smeared and when washed once the image was faded beyond recognition. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Stays put,Wherever I put it is where it stays. I have to admit I had my doubts that it would work this well. My dash is sloped and I have to set it near the edge as not to impair my vision. Even around the sharpest curves it doesn't move. It has lots of positions to adjust the unit for viewing and to prevent glare. Just loosen the adjustment screws to put it at the perfect angle then tighten them up. The speaker works great.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,"Low Price, High Performance.","I admit I was attracted to the Scepter x7g-Komodo LCD Monitor by its bargain price.  I also admit I was a little concerned by one of the other user reviews that mentioned problems.  I ordered the monitor anyway-- and I couldn't be more pleased.  First, Amazon operated with its usual efficiency.  The vendor--Tiger Direct-- was also outstanding.  The Monitor arrived two days after it was ordered.  The monitor was well packed and even survived what appeared to be a UPS ""oops"" incident.  The instructions were clear with a very nicely illustrated manual.  The monitor--as mentioned in other reviews- has speakers included. They are just okay.  I am using my Polk Audio speakers instead.  The display is beautiful.  It was plug and play--no adjustments were needed.  The images are sharp. Colors are awesome.  If you want an LCD monitor and want to save some money-- this is an outstanding choice"
electronics,25 of 27,4.0,Business Phone,I had a chance to use the Panasonic KX-TS3292B in my home office thanks to a friend who lent me one. Now I need to buy my own. This is a great phone for any small or home business although I'm not sure why it's listed here for $129.99 list when Panasonic's own site shows the MSRP as $99.95.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works as advertised!,"A friend said this is the right radar detector, and he was right. Drove from Chicago to Montana and back and was always informed of active radar sources along the way. Was surprised when it picked up roadside speed warning sign, but that should have been expected. Batteries still going after six full days of driving over 10 hours a day"
electronics,,5.0,Best Trackball Ever!,"I have always been a fan of Kensington trackball products, and I thought they had cornered the market with their previous gray and blue model.  I was skeptical about replacing that one; but after four years of use, the moving parts were no longer in prestine condition.  Fortunately, I had the opportunity of using the new model at work, and I was convinced that this optical K Mouse was well worth owning.  Its smooth movement made computer use more enjoyable, and its contour design reduces my wrist stress factor to zero.  This input device is awesome"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,I am glad I bought this product,"I travel a lot and I purchased this model for my laptop and Creative's Webcam Live! Pro 2.0 for my home computer. My intention was to use the two, in conjunction with MSN Messenger, to talk to the wife and two little ones while on the road via a high-speed internet connection. I won't get into every little detail, rather I will hit on the major items. These apply to both products unless otherwise stated;"
electronics,,5.0,They are working fine,"Just set these speakers up. Was very easy and they are working as promised, Sound great"
electronics,16 of 18,2.0,"Toshiba usually reliable, not in this case","My positive experiences with Toshiba in the past is what lead me to purchase this specific brand DVD player.  My family and I went on two vacations within the last month and this was purchased for my children to watch their movies during the plane rides. Immediately out of the box the DVD player functioned very loudly when loading a DVD, making a grinding/grunting noise.  It did have a beautiful picture on the LCD screen, however.  The player only lasted about 3 weeks and stopped working during our return flights from our second vacation.  It didn't even last one month!  I would avoid purchasing this item again because, even when working, it took forever to load DVD's and was very loud when doing so.  Not to mention that if you have problems with the unit, you have to send it to Toshiba for service and cannot return it to the vendor you purchase if from, which is a significant inconvenience. "
electronics,19 of 19,4.0,Gets the job done,"As a college student and a military aircrew member, it is important for me to be able to do my assignments when I'm flying overseas. I don't own a laptop because my Palm T|X does the job for me with its Documents to Go feature. The Palm Wireless Keyboard makes life easier for me. My information/Review is based on my own experience with this keyboard."
electronics,,5.0,Works Great!,"Solid and durable.  Good range.  Makes the wearer look a little silly with the antenna sticking up, but who cares?  It works"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Some kinda cheap look,"I needed a financial calculator and I had received a lot of good feedback from 12c owners. This added to my experience with two HP calculators one 15c and one 48G, told me I couldn't go wrong with this special edition."
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,My First Wireless Pocket PC Card,"I have been using the WCF54G Card for almost a year. My router is a Wrt54G Linksys. My Pocket PC is an Ipaq 3835. It was an easy instillation, and I was up and operational in minutes. I get very good to minimal reception throughout my home. I can get"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Sony STRDE197-stereo receiver,"An overall excellent value for the price. Sony well styled and considering that most receivers are now multi-channel this is a straight forward two channel receiver best for those of us having one left and one right ear. Excellent choice for den or summer home -not intended for a  multichannel, multi switching audio video receiver control center"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Pretty good for the price,I'm writing a review on the Koss R-80. First off I had a pair of Koss UR20. These Koss R-80 off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design. The headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head. It has a coiled cord which can be removed. The cord is connected like a phone card. 
electronics,2 of 5,5.0,a must have,"hasn't failed me yet, i buy duo cards for all my sony gadets, new stuff will use duo or the m2 format no need to invest into the full size format"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,OK...not the best,"A year ago, I wanted an mp3 player, since I didnt download music, I wanted one that recorded off the radio...this was about the only choice, and after reading many bad reviews I decided to buy it anyways on Ebay for $180. MISTAKE...this isnt a horrible mp3 player, it just isnt worth the price. It is hard to find music, and a lot of the features dont work. My shuffle, playback, and playlist all dont work. The navigation is ok...The radio gets pretty good reception but recording is a hassle because you have to get perfect reception of youll hear fuzziness throughout the song, and the 30 second record playback isnt all that is says...it just starts 30 seconds earlier so you have 25 seconds of talking or commericals and then your 5 seconds of the song you missed. But a month after a bought it, my stop button doesnt work, so when I go to the radio I have to stay at the radio or turn it off. The buttons are cheap. The screen gets dirty, especially on the inside so you cant clean it. Overall this is an OK mp3 player, not great but not horrible. I am going to buy an ipod, and if your reading this you probably should to."
electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Great product,I have an almost constant stream of guests who rapidly fill up the memory capacity on their digital cameras and/or want to exchange images with others. Invariably they will not have their USB cable with them. I keep the reader permanently connected and on my desktop. This reader allows me to quickly create a CD for them or transfer images from one card to another
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Does not actually support the TiVo,"TiVo is listed as a supported device but the functionality is not complete. You can't actually step up and down through the menu items one by one, making the remote completely worthless for use with a TiVo. Also, the support website site printed on the back of the packaging does not work, it appears to be misconfigured. "
electronics,5 of 5,2.0,Fast clean print with poor paper handling and noise,"Output is very quick.  Printouts are very clean.  Graphics look excellent.  Noise from paper path is excessive--  I've actually returned (2) under warranty hoping that the sound of marbles it makes when moving paper through the path would go away.  The 3rd printer still makes the noise - so I can assume this is hereditary to the machine.  Paper path definitely wrinkles paper- but eventually it settles down.  Envelope feeder is very finicky as to what envelopes you use. I've noted creases on all envelopes except a Brother specified Office Depot product. For the price, if you can stand the noise and short term wrinkling, it's worth it.  But...  consider the Samsung alternative.  I purchased an ML 3051ND for my other location about 90 days ago.  Same speed. Similar outputs - but no paper handling crinkling issues (Samsung gives you the option of a straight paper path by dropping the rear door -  Brother has eliminated this capability) and No noise. Plus, it has a display to tell you in English what's going on as opposed to trying to decipher Brother's light codes.   It's about $70 more, but significantly better in quality and feel.  I'd recommend spending the extra money. Everytime you throw out a crinkled envelope or try to flatten out a stack of printouts or hear the marbles in a tin can sound of the machine's operation you'll be reminded of the $70 you saved.  Buy cheap, suffer long"
electronics,25 of 25,4.0,"Philips 17PF8946 17"" LCD Flat Panel HDTV-Ready TV","You can't beat the low price on this 17"" LCD TV. The picture quality with HDTV or DVD-Progessive Scan sources is excellent. Built-in stereo speakers and FM tuner are handy features, but sound quality is mediocre, so recommend using with home theater audio system for your audio. Generous variety of video inputs. However, only one handles true high definition sources, a standard 15-pin VGA input which accepts either (1) the in-the-box included cable which has the VGA connector on one end and the three component video jacks (standard color-coded RCA type) at the other end, or (2) a cable with VGA connectors at both ends (not included) for hookup to a PC. For more than one high-definition source you'll need a switchbox (I bought one from an electronics store to connect my satellite HDTV and DVD-Proscan player), or a VGA splitter (for two PC's). All in all a great bargain. "
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,This thing is great!!!,"I previously had a keyboad that came with my computer it was horrible none of the number keys would work.  I would have to pound on it to get it to work.  So i just broke that keyboard.  I was in search of a new one so I looked around on amazon and found this keyboard i decided yo buy it because it was only 12 bucks so if i didnt like it wat the heck i would buy a 20 buck one. So i recently recieved the keyboard and i love it. It looks great it feels great the keys are very soft to the touch. Everything!!! is labeled i can do anything from my keyboard i can send my email i can reply i can open aol instan messenger i can change the song i can fastforward! I can turn up the volume turn it down i can mute it i can open my email i can open my music i can open my internet! I can even open my computer, my documents, my pictures, and my music. Also many of the keys r labeled such a y is redo u is underline. i is italic c is copy and etc.. This makes everything very fast and easy! I love this keyboard. also my previous keyboard wire was barely long enough this one is more than enough. Same with my logitch 3 button optical mouse that thing is great.  Logitech makes great products.  Oh and the thing about the start buttons like if ur doin something and u accidently hit that button all u have to do is take a screw driver and pull of that key than it wont happen anymore.  But with this keyboard since the outer buttons are curved down like space and such you rarely accidentally hit those buttons annymore. It also has a button that locks all the f keys which is quite useful.  I love this keyboard and i HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Oh and one more thing when ever you press one of the like f buttons or email or media buttons it brings it up in green on you screen what you just pressed and its GREAT!!!!! I highly recommend buying this product!"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,A gem,I travel in airplanes a lot and I got tired of people always yapping:
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Amazon = Deals,"The number of complaints regarding Amazon is amazing and unfair.  All you need to do is read carefully and you won't ""get screwed"" . . . . be aware of where you are going.  Are you still on Amazon or have you clicked-off onto another site?  Like the young lady from New England, USA, I also get my orders shipped free, and that's on top of the discounted prices.  I'm more than happy!"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,NO BATTERY BACK UP!!  ,"We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up"
electronics,,5.0,Love it.,It works for me- but I'm not a high tech person.  Just a student studying abroad with a three year old digital camera.  My camera is slow so I haven't noticed any issues with it not being able to keep up.  It's so great never having to worry about using up all the space- I even have videos on there
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Product,"I bought this USB Cable online alot cheaper than I could have in any electronic store.  I thought 30.00 was to much to pay for this cable.  Cable works great with my all in one printer, fax and scanner"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Goodly little mousie,"I was looking for a mouse to use with an HP ""LiveStrong"" laptop. I liked the size of the mouse, as well as the price. Positive reviews made me decide to give it a try. I've had the mouse for two months now, and so far it has been working well. The only complaint that I have: it tends to lose bluetooth connection randomly. Sometime I have to search for it using ""Search for devices in range"" function on my laptop. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Phone,"Good slim design, my  favorite about this  phone is the  lighted  key  feature, since I have  it  by my bed, it makes it far  easier  to see the lighted keys  for  easy visual of  the  numbers"
electronics,1 of 4,2.0,bulky--heavy,"I am a big fan of headphones. This pair of headphones in comparing with the Bose is too heavy and comfortable for my ears. Giving the price of the product, I guess it is ok."
electronics,3 of 8,5.0,Hands free to jam !!,"My husband and I are in a Southern Rock Band and I sing backup and play the Tamborine. He recently purchased the Plantronics Encore Monaural Headset with Noise Cancelling Microphone for my birthday. Well....I love it. Before, if I was jamming with the tamborine and had to step up to the microphone and do some backup vocals, it was a little awkward. It really made it hard to boogie, sing and jam at the same time. Now with my new toy, its great. The quality is excellent. I would have never thought that the output would be so clear with a hands free unit, but it is. All the band members think its great and want a set now"
electronics,,5.0,Convenient ,"The cradle works great. However, it's a little difficult positioning the PDA on the power source. A little bit better design would have helped. However, once it's in position, it will stay. You know it will be charged properly."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,iPod Rocks,"The Apple iPod is absolutely GREAT!! It is so easy to use and to put songs onto it. The battery lasts for a really long time. It holds more songs than I will ever need to put on there. Tremendous amount of accesories to go with with it. Put it in the car, desktop, whatever, it is great"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,This one FINALLY got it right!.,"After purchasing several unsatisfactory brand-name cordless phone sets, this one FINALLY got it right. Sound is clear outgoing, incoming, on speaker, AND on message playback (it also has a hearing-aide compatible mode which we have not tried). All handsets are updated automatically without the need to enter phonebook numbers (or date and time) separately. Each handset is capable of retrieving messages, interrupiting incoming screened calls, and storing (or deleting) caller IDs. Every handset has a speaker phone mode, a belt clip, and the option of it's own ringtone. Very convenient. Handsets can be put into baby monitor mode. The system is expandable. Answering machine flashes an amber antennae light on each set until the message is played back, and playback does not remove the number notation that there is a message on the phone (like our last set did!"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,After tweaking... Perfect for me,"After reading the reviews, I decided to give the Sure E3C a chance. I was comparing with models from Shure, Sony & B&O. What sold me on Shure was the Fit Kit that allows you to get as good of a fit as possible. If you've owned many in-ear models, you know how awful it is if the fit is wrong. If it doesn't seal in your ear, you get no bass. If it is too tight it sounds like you are listening to a boombox in a dumpster. I tried many of the fits and ended up preferring the foam that you pinch and insert into your ear. The foam expands conforming to your ear canal for an exceptional fit."
electronics,1 of 4,5.0,Canon CL-51 High Capacity Color FINE Ink Cartridge,Good quality product.  Service was fast and efficient.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,review of IPOD,It's perfect for the gym. I religiously use it and because it's compact it's easy to workout
electronics,12 of 12,5.0,smaller than I thought and easy to use,"I got my zen v and was surprised how tiny it is. It is much smaller than you might think. It's light and easy to use. I found the new joy stick to be a great idea. I didn't have any problems and I dont have tiny fingers. This is an easy player to use and is built beautifully. The quality is as good or better than iPod. I was going to get the zen v plus with video but I couldnt wait and am not that into video on a small player anyhow. The price is very low for these zen v players, especially considering that they are super high build quality. All you have to do is charge the player for a few hours before you mess around with it. So, I highly recommend this delightful player for ease of use and build quality. IMHO it's better than apple and much better than sandisk. You will be impressed. I also would like to stress that the joystick system on this player is easy to use and very simple to figure out. I have had nothing but a good experience using this. Read the manual on the cd if you can hold back from just trying to play with it to figure it out. Even though it doesnt have radio or a video function, the zen v has  a lot of options in its menu to mess around with. I am very impressed with the high quality creative is giving out along with low prices. The mp3 market has a lot of options now but the zen v plus is the best for my money. I have a lot of experience with MP3 players and this is the most impressive one yet for its size. Go to a store and check out how small it really is and how nice the player is put together and how easy the navigation is with the new joystick system. You will probably end up getting one. To be honest though, if you do check it out, you won't freak out how small it is when you get it in the mail like I did before seeing it,so flip a coin on that deal.Have fun!"
electronics,3 of 9,5.0,Excellent sound,After reading all the good reviews I decided to buy the UE super.fi 5 Pro's.  They are the only phones I use at the gym now.  Great noise blocking ability.  Volume can be kept low but still is loud enough to hear clearly.  The two drivers in each ear are very clear---the sound is rather remarkable really.    For music at the gym or anywhere you need to block out exterior noise these things are great.  Sound is crisp and clear.  You will never go back to a cheaper pair of in ear phones again
electronics,,5.0,Excellent,For a product that was refurbished I was nervous about scratches and wear on the item.  This product came in perfect condition and as promised.  I can't speak for all of their items but I can definitely sa that I was satisfied with this item. 
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great! Much better than Belkin F5D7050,"After months of cursing at unreliable access using a Belkin F5D7050, I bought this Linksys and it's been working without fault for a month. Great"
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Worked Great... For a While,"I'm writing this review as I'm packing up my router into it's box so that I can return it. I've had this product for about 3 months and I've had intermittent problems throughout that time, mostly needing to reset the router once a week. Three days ago, I started to experiencing wireless drops on my MacBook where I would reset the router, only to have another drop 3 to 5 minutes later. The next day, I couldn't get the DNS server to assign me an IP address when connecting though the wired or wireless port. Thinking it was a problem with my MacBook, I tried to connect with my laptop from work... same problem. I then upgraded the firmware and even reset the router to factory defaults, but I still can't get an IP address. Now, I'm connect directly to my cable modem and have had no issues for the past hour."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Option,I own a Sony Cybershot and this is an excellent option to use for the best price
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Picture tube blow out,I got it for my sister for her birthday in june... she use it everyday since july and now in august its dead. The picture tube just blew out for no reason. VERY UPSET. Buyers Beware
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,a fabulous little squid for under the desk!,"this is the most fantastic ""powerstrip"" i have ever connected cords to. they all fit, without a single wasted outlet and it is designed so nicely; who ever put this much thought in to a powerstrip before? why didn't someone think of this earlier? i for one am a fan. genius"

electronics,0 of 1,4.0,excellent product,"I have never had any problems with this ink cartridge. Never clogs like the lexmark. Easy to replace, also"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,The NuLOOQ Device is a must have!!!,"I bought a NuLOOQ when it first came out for the Mac. I've been an Illustrator & Visualization Artist for 17 years now. I have an iMac at home and a PC at my full-time job. It takes a little while to break some old habbits, but once you do, and get used to the NuLOOQ device, you'll never go back! I love this smart toy! I got so hooked on it, I recently purchased one for my PC here at work. If there is anyone out there that thinks it's just for the Mac your wrong! The PC version is just as good! It's become part of my left hand and I still use my Wacom tablet all the time also! To me, this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer; cross platform. Bravo to Logitech for making another great product! Get one...I'll guarantee you'll get hooked on it"
electronics,66 of 66,1.0,Dumb dumb dumb,What do they say about fools and money?
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Pleased Customer,"The unit works beautifully.  I have a major hearing loss, and use two very powerful hearing aids, which are not always all I need.  My headset, used without hearing aids, gives me beautifully clear reception. I am so excited about them.  You may note that I ended up purchasing a total of 3 of the headsets, two being for a grandson and a close friend.  Can't wait to start chatting with them"
electronics,20 of 29,5.0,Very Satisfied,I have been using these to record gardening programs and have not had a problem
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Keeps Humming Along,"Should be ZERO stars.  Bought to use between a DVD player and an old TV.  This thing produces an orange tint picture and a ""hum"" or static sound so loud that you can forget about hearing the content.  I tried this on two different players and two different TVs - it was universally horrible (hum was constant on one player & intermittent on the other).  Bought this at a local store - should have checked here first.  Just swapped it out with the Philips unit which works GREAT for about the same price"
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,Very comfortable...,"I went through 2 Microsoft mice last 2 years with left click button giving out within few months. I did try 2 other Microsoft mice but I was not happy with them. So, I decided to go with Logitech. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"ViewSonic Optiquest Q7b 17"" LCD Monitor","Well worth the money. Crisp view, speakers aren't the greatest, but they are all that was needed for a spare computer and an all-in-one video/sound setup. I have been using it for about two months now and have not had any problems. Since I AM using this WALL MOUNTED LCD SCREEN (mount sold separately)in a VERY dusty/dirty environment, I glued glass on the front to make wiping it off easy, without messing up the lcd. I would recommend this monitor to anyone. Hope this review helps someone to make a decision, one way or the other. It uses a standard computer plug too (no wall adapter as I think some of the LCD's use"
electronics,,5.0,Nice BASS but agree with others on ease of use,"that is, I see now why some people put down that these are harder to get on your ears, and they are a little more difficult, BUT once on they don't fall off easily. "
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE,TDK products have always been excellent products for the mone
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Very sleek product,"This is the third Creative MP3 player that I have bought. The first two were accidentally broken, no fault of the manufacturer, and I am convinced by the quality of product that Creative Labs produces. "
electronics,,4.0,The best I've heard from a package that pleases as much as these do.,    I did a lot of online research for headphones in this price range.  The reviews kept coming to this product.  So what the heck.  I went for them.  Found them at a price that made it well worth the effort.  Then they arrived....  If I'd known that they were this good I would have paid top dollar without complaint.
electronics,12 of 12,1.0,Problems,"The phone answering system has problems hanging up.  So when people do not leave a message, you get a lot of messages from the phone company stating that ""please hang up and try to call again"" followed by a fast busy signal.  This takes a couple of minutes.  It's not possible to receive incoming calls to the answering machine or call out from another phone on the same line while this is going on.  "
electronics,,5.0,Works without a hitch!,"I needed CDs that would work on my new Sony CD Recorder ... the Recorder will only record onto ""music"" CDs in the cda format.  I didn't take this warning seriously at the outset (I didn't realize there was a difference between regular CDs and ""music"" CDs), and of course the machine wouldn't work.  After a small amount of research, I bought this well-priced spindle ... and the recording has proceeded without any further hiccups"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,It goes part of the way,I was hoping to have a solution that lets me just log in with a single fingerprint.  This was not the solution.  
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,I'm amazed,"Wow, 50 batteries for 9 bux is a DEAL! And of course, it lasts as long as a name brand battery if your going to use it for small devices (cd player, clock, etc...)"
electronics,11 of 30,1.0,This product stinks,I dislike ipods so i figure I try something else and hope for the best..Unfortunately I was wrong
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,"It's a digital signal, people.","As an audio engineer, I understand the importance of good cables. I saw HDMI cables for over a hundred dollars, and I began to wonder why I should truly spend that much."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,stability for your tunes,No more will you fumble for your mini as you hit a speed bump or pothole and your iPod goes flying across the car. The Tunedock comes with 3 cup sizes to accommodate nearly every car cup holder on the market of varying sizes to ensure your iPod is always accessible to you while driving
electronics,,5.0,"Great product for protecting the screen and body.  Looks ""rugged""",- iPod screens and surfaces scratch very easily. This cover protects these sensitive surfaces and gives the iPod a rugged look and is easy to grip.
electronics,5 of 8,4.0,Difficult to use,It took me two hours to get everything working on my computer.  I found it very frustrating to get started.  Once I got the product working it is great. 
electronics,,5.0,The best you dont imagine how good they are ,"I say buy them because they are exactly what you will need if you want to expand your wireless, just with the antennas i cover a total of 100 Mts, and extra with the Expander i have a great signal no matter where we are locate"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great for Apple earphones too,"Based on reviews on the Apple web site, I bought these for Apple's in-ear earphones, which otherwise have a tendency to slip out.  These look funny but work great.  I find myself using lower volumes, even on the subway"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Love these,Bought these for my daughter to take to college....her freshman year...she loves these and the price at the time was fantastic ($107)...wish I had bought one for my son as wel
electronics,,4.0,Pretty good backpack -- just a few complaints,"I got this backpack in January 2005, so this review can be considered a ""wear and tear"" critique. I live in New York City, and had previously used a Contour top-loading attache case. However, I found the case bulky (especially in subways) and was worried about the shoulder strap breaking as it started to separate. Thus, I looked for a good laptop backpack that would be comfortable, secure, and durable. Overall, I am pleased with the backpack. It holds a heavy 17"" laptop (10 lbs) snugly and it is comfortable on the shoulders. When fully loaded (including computer) with books and other supplies, it gets quite heavy. Some of my friends have struggled to lift it -- but I suppose that's from the contents, not the backpack. Its strengths include a good amount of interior pockets within three large compartments, plus several outer compartments that can be filled with essentials needed ""on the go."" The backpack remains comfortable, especially on the shoulders. The fabric has remained flawless -- no rips, tears, or seam separations. The contents remain dry in rainy weather (although I am usually under an umbrella). "
electronics,,4.0,PG-40 cartridge for Canon Pixma IP1600,New cartridge had been received on time and well packed.
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Should include a USB cord,"Works as expected, however, for ~$40, they should at least include a cord to go from this dock to the computer or stereo"

electronics,15 of 15,4.0,Mission Adequate,"I found the plastic arm to be a bit flexible.  And when using the GPS unit (punching buttons) I find that I need to hold the back of the GPS unit to push the ""click stick"".  I was thinking of using the ""removable"" adhesive to switch back and forth between two cars, but the adhesive is pretty much one use only.  I'm a bit annoyed that if I want the weighted auto base (the friction mount) I have to buy this to get the arm, and then buy the base separetely."
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Keep researching...this DLO is a stinker!,"Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last."
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,The best paper I have used.,"HP Photo paper is by far the best of all the paper I have used, and not just in HP printers. My ...

The paper has far more to do with the quality of the image than the printer, and this is the best paper you can get"
electronics,17 of 17,2.0,Motorola T7400R GMRS ,"Nice pieces of equipment, but not what I was led to believe. They delivered what they promised, EXCEPT FOR THE RANGE. No, I did not expect ""12 miles"" of range, even within a line of site. I came into this deal expecting and requiring a range of only two miles as the crow flies to communicate with other parties. Unfortunatly, all the Moto's could muster was 7 tenths of a mile through light foilage (pine trees). Nice two-way radio's, but unless you are within a line of site, forget their promise of distance. If you can see the target, then you will connect. If not, use your cellular"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,great deal nice tv,"Got this last week after doing oodles of research for the best tv under $500. Originally I was going to go with the Toshiba 26' widescreen hdtv, but the thing was just way to small. Saw a deal for this in the paper for $450 at p.c. richards including the matching stand. Decided that hdtv wasn't that essential after reading the good reviews. I have it hooked up to digital cable and bought component cables for my dvd player. The picture is VERY good, and nice and big. The sound so-so but more than manageable. Thank you new technology for helping bring down the price of what was probably an $800 television"
electronics,,4.0,Good player,"The Creative Zen Nano Plus is a great little player. I have not had time to use all of the features yet. I love the color and that was a deciding factor. The only thing that I did not like were the ear buds because they are too large for my ears, fall out and hurt after they have been in for a while."
electronics,,5.0,Hands free telephone,"I have owned a plantronics hands free set for three years, it is the most relable phone I use, has a very generous range and except for the cord from the headset to the receiver getting caught on things from time to time, it is a perfect tool"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Very good headphones,"I recently bought the Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless headphones, and the sound is excellent, the only small problem is when I walk around the house, I will hear faint static, or sometimes, the sound drops out for a second. I am glad it has volume and balance on the headphones. I am still quite happy with my purchas"
electronics,,5.0,Finally a CD that works in my car,"Tested at 32x (I slowed my burner down a bit) and these work great in both my home stereo (panasonic) and car (saab 9-3).  I haven't been able to find blank CD's that work in several years, they usually end up choppy with noise after the first few songs.  Memorex has brought back whatever worked in the blank CD's of old, I can only hope they keep them in production as long as I have my car."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Works well but not flawless,"I used this device, and it works well as advertised with some notes:"
electronics,,1.0,Great brightness control !,"Finally I have found a digital clock that has a full range of variable brightness levels.  A dial allows you to change continuously from bright to invisible.  MUCH better than the typical High/Low switch.  But, the level we find comfortable at night makes the clock virtually unreadable during the day, unless you want to fiddle with the control every day.  Have not tried other features, but it seems to have all the goodies you would want"
electronics,12 of 21,1.0,No volume control? runs on batteries?,I got an iPod Nano about a month ago and wanted some speakers. I got these speakers because they were cheap and was a good company name. I got these speakers delivered 2 weeks ago and plugged them into my nano. They sounded soooooooo bad! 
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Damn good cans!,They cancel noise in the low frequency range really well.  Sound out of them is superb.  The only downside is the very slight hum/hiss when they are turned on.  And ashame you can't use them with out the noise cancelling.  Very good headphones for the price
electronics,,5.0,Great Wireless Mouse.,"Use this mouse every day for over 2 months. I've never had to reset it, and I find it to be very accurate. Battery life seems to be great as well,(haven't changed mine yet). Travels really well with the USB receiver mounting on the bottom of the mouse."
electronics,,5.0,Great mouse,"It's really smart,cute and sturdy than it looks from the picture, except the curved line sometimes bother me; however, I still like it. The small size fit my palm and its movements on screen really smooth"

electronics,12 of 12,1.0,Does not work with 5G IPOD,"I bought a Video IPOD 60gb and when I connected the Belkin Media Reader to it an error message popped up and said that the device currently connected is NOT compatable with this IPOD.  So, I guess it is for OLDER IPODs (3G) only"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,I like what I bought,"A while back, I bought a TiVo and needed a USB network device to access my network.  So I went to TiVo's website and found that this adapter works with TiVo, so I bought it and followed the directions I'd found on how to make it work.  It worked like a charm.  Since it's been up and running, I've had just about zero problems with it."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Surge Plug,"This is the 3rd surge plug that I have purchased.  The first one met an untimely death do to a major water spill from a fish aquarium, but all the equipment attached to it survived.  All in all, these plugs are the best.  Each plug is labled and you get tags to label your cords (a nice feature if all your plugs are same color and style).  the added area for power packs is a nice touch as those take up so much room"
electronics,,5.0,Been looking for this item at a good Price,The item works just great. I can now hook up my computer in the car and use it with my GPS without spending a large amount of money getting one just for the car. I have checked around and this is a good price.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good product,You can't reach to high with these. but it is nice it doesn't required a power line (uses USB)
electronics,5 of 6,2.0,Poor Support and Lockups,"I love the unit...when its working...software problems in the beginning and was transferred to ""upper level"" support who told me I should replace my new Dell XPS 600...I eventually fixed the problem...then frequent lockups...emailed tech support...responded in 24 hours with a test which I performed immediately and emailed back the results...two days later and no response...called customer support who stated that they were sending out new unit in two days...four days later got an email that Logitech was processing the order and that the new unit would be delivered in 5-7 business days...All my equipment is in a remote location so I must go to other room to change channels, volume input etc.  Logitech doesn't seem to care...I'm presently on the phone waiting for tech support and have been holding for 20 minutes thus far...Good luck if you buy this one..."

electronics,9 of 9,4.0,Perhaps the best of its kind -- at this price,"  I feel I owe readers this assessment, given how much wasted energy went into trying to find a suitable digital answering machine w/caller ID at a price under $80.  I'm very happy with this machine and feel it has only a few flaws. "
electronics,,4.0,HP is riding RPN into the ground,The HP17 is a good calculator but does not have a feature set or build quality to not match the price point. Buy HP RPN only if you can't live without it.

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Canon photo paper,"I purchased the Canon Pixma iP6210D and a sample of this paper came with it. I printed a few photos and couldn't believe the print quality, as good as processed film"
electronics,,5.0,Great notebook mouse,I am glad I took my time before I chose this mouse.  I had a Logitech wireless mouse prior to this one but it was not for a notebook.  Using a notebook mouse definately makes a difference.   What's great about this mouse is the USB reciever is very small and I like that it connects to the mouse when you are not using it.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very decent product,"Used it for almost a half year,a nd I am very pleased for the quality and fuctionality.  It is a  bit loud, though, but not much."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good for basic protection.,"The iSocks are great for basic protection, but you should still handle your iPod with care.  I had keys in my pocket and without thinking put my iPod in the same pocket (with the iSock on).  When I took out my iPod, I had a lovely 1 inch scratch on the screen.  I'm now waiting to get my iDrops, so hopefully those will fix it."

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Satisfaction & Convenience,I needed an mini-SD memory card for a new cell phone-mp3 unit. LG 8100.  It was convenient to order from Amazon.  I received the memory card.  It works.  No hitches
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Simple, works well","I already had a WiFi router and the combo, co-branded Linksys / Vonage routers have had some awful reviews. I've had this for about eight months and it works fine. Simple, plug-in set up, plays well with my router and network. Never given me any problems of significance; I had to reset it once after a power outage, that's the worse thing. "
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Nedessary accessory for all computer users,"I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage."
electronics,,5.0,A Must Have For Computer Pilots!,"Great product for computer flight simulation.  Easily installs, well made and works great"
electronics,7 of 12,1.0,DO NOT BUY ALTEC LANSING IM616,Quality of Phones: Sound is good if you don't mind hearing your own footsteps and every other sound that the wire captures-very poor insulation of connecting cord.
electronics,1 of 7,4.0,"good gadget, bad customer service","There was a discount on this item right after I gave my order so I called for a price match and the CSR asked me to reject the first delivery and wait for the new order with new lower price, which means Amazon will pay for 3 times shipping cost and I will have to wait for more days! what a solution!"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Great monitor....if it works!,My old company used ViewSonic and I always loved them. When it came time to get a new monitor I saw my chance and chose the Optiquest Q9b.
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,echo problems,This headset has echo problems for the person you're speaking to.
electronics,6 of 8,2.0,Purchased for Palm TX based on the prior glowing reviews.,"I purchased this case for my Palm TX, based on the prior glowing reviews.  I was looking for a nice book-style case made in soft leather.  I recently up-graded from a Palm VX with Palm case."
electronics,,5.0,Get it.,Very simple to use and at a great price. I attached mine to an ATV
electronics,4 of 8,2.0,This television is too large.,I went from a Sony 42 inch 1080i to this Samsung 61 inch 720p.  The 42 inch picture quality is much better.  The 61 inch television is nice but I can clearly detect the square pixels even in high definition broadcasts.  I believe the size and not the brand causes this.  I wish I had not bought this television and I cannot return it since I bought it from Amazon.  I will probably get used to it but my first impression is negative.  
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Flash Drive,I really like my U3 Travel Drive. I use it everyday at work. I had a 1Gb U3 Drive and found I used it so much I upgraded to the 2Gb.
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Good buy,"I love this phone. It has good reception and I like using the speakers in the base and the handset. I like the fact of playing with the different ring tones, which is a nice feature. I recommend this phone to anyone"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,3 years and going strong,"I bought these headphones over 3 years ago, and they are still going strong.  I use them in the office only, so they get little abuse (e.g. I don't blast the bass at work, or anything).  I have dropped them a number of times, though, and they didn't break.  The sound quality is good for listening to CDs, but like I said, I don't blast the bass or anything.  Finally, they are extremely comfortable.  I wear them for 7+ hours some days and they don't bother me one bit. "
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,How did I live without it?,"It was nearly one year ago when I first recieved a Green Ipod Mini for my birthday. Since then I am rarely without it. I'd been warned by a number of people that the batteries broke easily and that they got scratched like anything, but even so I decided it was the gadget for me. The risk payed off."
electronics,,5.0,These will Crush your Skull,Unbelievable sound...amazing bass...they feel kinda cheap...but their quite sturdy once you use them more...they chew a lot of batteries especially if you use the subwoofer a lot and have it on high volume...but again great sound...and yes they will block out any sound..used them on the plane and they were great ...couldnt even hear the engine of the plane..also come with airplane adaptors...so u can use them to watch movies or listen to the radio on the plan. Great value...also comfortable for long periods...check out skull candy for other audio products mostly headphones..nice selection and decent prices
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Excellent External Hard Drive,"I have been using the Seagate 300 GB External Hard Drive now for a little over two months. It is very quiet, easy to use and works great. Excellent equipment for the price. Have not had any problems"
electronics,,5.0,Great Gift,"I have now purchased as gifts 3 of the Zen V units. Great as a gift, especially with new low prices. I am a happy Zen M owner, but I'm tempted to buy one of these for myself"
electronics,10 of 14,1.0,I cancelled these headphones,I own a set of Sennheiser PXC 250 noise canceling headphones.  I reviewed them for Amazon a couple of years ago and gave them 5 stars. They are great.  Recently I got my wife an iPod nano and she stole my headphones. So I needed some new ones.  I read all the reviews on noise cancelling headphones (I fly a lot and the Sennheisers were great for listening to anything on a plane or even just canceling out ambient noise) and decided to try the Panasonic RPH300 based on the reviews and the fact that the cord on the Panasonic was a little flimsy for my wife (she broke one within a couple of days of first wearing it while moving around).
electronics,16 of 18,4.0,Not A Bad Product!,"I purchased this product from Best Buy store only to find out later that circut city had it for $20. cheaper but too late now!Product very easy to setup and use,good picture and sound quality.Not really worth the money to get the larger 8in. brother to this model no big difference in picture size.Mounts secure between seats with provided straps,the kids will love it"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,A lot of space at a great price,This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.
electronics,1 of 7,4.0,to have red or not to have red cover,Why does it cost more to be red than brown?  If you got-a have red than what els can you do?  Live with brown!  Seems to be will made & looks good
electronics,,4.0,Saitek PZ31A Pro Gamer Command Pad,This is a nicely made control pad for gaming and can be programmed for shortcut tasks as well for applications. The pad is illuminated and indicates the unit is on and which set of macros are currently being used. It looks cool on the desk too. 
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Must have for travel or just convenient home charging.,"I bought 2 of these, one here when I had a survey coupon which reduced the price by $10 and one on ebay for half of retail, and find that they are totally worth it!  "
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Fine print,This ink is perfectly fine; I just think the pricing is exploitative.  I've already spent more on ink than I paid for the Epson printer.  (And why is it that the black cartridge costs more than the one with 5 colors?
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Fun to use...motivational....nike+ shoes not necessary, 
electronics,,2.0,work ok but with some bugs,"I got this player from Wal-Mart for about $72 after tax.  I like the long battery live, I didn't have to change the battery after 3 or 4 days of usage."
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Intec controllers suck!,I had a controller and it lasted about 2 weeks.  My Uncle bought an intec and it lasted 2 days!  I have a pelican wirelass and it's been dependable so far.  stay away from intec
electronics,6 of 6,1.0,Stay away from this dangerous remote,"I bought this remote and hooked it up one evening. It worked okay, but it is picky about the line of sight.  However, the next morning I looked at my iPod and was horrified to see that it had discoloured the screen.  There was a yellow and purplish rainbow effect across the top of the screen and since it radiated from the sensor on the remote receiver it left no doubt that the DLO iDirect remote had caused the discolouration.  I was afraid that if I continued to use this remote probably after a week the screen would be completely black.  I called the manufacturer and they tried to pass off responsibility to the store that sold it to me.  So if you value your iPod, stay as far away from the DLO iDirect remote as possible.  This thing is dangerous"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Spend a little $ extra and get something else,"I had an iRock! Model 400 for a long time, and it worked GREAT.  It worked for the 30 feet as advertised, and then some, and reception was stable.   "
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"Greatly improved design, but they still could make one last simple optional improvement.","A lot of people, in reviewing this product, complained that in order to use the bike mount they had to replace the original back cover with a lesser one--included with this purchase.  This is no longer a problem."
electronics,1 of 6,1.0,Waste of money,I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started.  Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own.  It really is worse than when I started. 
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,It just works,I had no problem plugging in the switch.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A must have item,The iQue 3600 GPS with the auto bundle is a can't do without item.
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Unreliable at best and poorly documented.,I am a networking professional with many years experience so I was able to get it to work.  I have no idea how a novice would have any success with this device.  The documentation is almost non-existent and some of the explanations are just flat wrong.  I would not buy this product again.
electronics,24 of 24,5.0,Excellent Printer,"This printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear.  I have a Cybershot T-1 camera and the combination is nice.  The printer speed was quick too! I couldn't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the TV and view the pictures that I had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control.  I would recommend this printer because of the easy setup, quick printing speed, and excellent quality of the pictures"
electronics,,4.0,Good for the price - $19.99,Good life for the battery after it is charged. It takes 7 hours to charge though
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,"Poor tech support , didn't work for me","I purchased this card for downloading pictures from my digital SLR to my Compaq Presario 2100.    All the drivers seemed to install when I plugged it in.  My usb mouse worked ok with it.  But my camera was at least twice as slow as 1.1 when plugged into it, and usually would get timeout errors.    I tried troubleshooting for a couple days, no luck.  The technical support guy (I think there is only one at Addonics)  could only suggest plugging in the power adapter and reinstalling drivers, and it should work.  It didn't.  I gave up and returned it. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Wonderful for mobility!,"Fantastic item for mobility. I mean it is small, light and easy to setup.  It has Prologic II which is nice for 2.0,.1 upmix. It can handle everything all the way up to 7.1 MANY connections for a lot of eqpt.  3 optical, 3 analogue, digital coax,,, pretty good!!!  It's remote control has a simple layout that is easy to use.  functions are nice and user friendly as well. You can plug this thing into anything!!!  Walkman, you name it! You can plug it into a entertainment center main junction and WHAMMO!  You get 7.1 sound through everything that is connected. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent sounding headset AND answer calls,"This is a great sounding headset!  I use it with my Motorola Q, to listen to mp3s.  The sound is very full, with crisp highs and deep bass.  The rubber earpieces do isolate the rest of the outside noise which is very good for sound, but not good if you're jogging/biking outdoors etc.  These are definitely the best sounding in-ear style headsets I've tried.  Earbuds are NO comparison!  Highly recommended"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Under-Counter iPod Player,"This product is value packed. The product fits extremely well under my cabinet. All of my iPods and shuffle fit nicely. The sound quality is excellent, the TV channels and weather channels are received well in any kind of weather. The battery power feature came in handy during power outages. The product was well packed, easy to install, and looks beautiful as it fits into any decor"
electronics,16 of 17,5.0,Monster does it again!   A+,"I just bought a new computer and I new if I ever needed a new surge protector, monster would have what I need.  This baby has it all.  Clearly marked, 3 prong, plugs for the computer, monitor, printer, scanner, modem,  speakers and two extras...  It also includes phone line protection from  impulses and discharges caused from surge pulses (you need this!  without  this, I've lost two modems from storms 30 minutes away!).  It includes a  since 8ft long power line which is heavily insolated.  Other bonuses  include the 1665 joule rating, the 24k gold contact grounded plug, little  stickers to mark your cables with and a Monster phone line cable.  I also  like its attractive look.  Most are white and stand out.  Since this model  is black, it appears a little secluded on my desk.  But that's not all.   You're backed with a grantee this baby will not fail.  If it does, you are  covered my Monster's insurance!  That's worth 50 bucks alone"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,I love it!!,"I love this product. I was a little wary about it's size, but wow this little device really packs quite a punch!!!! The sound quality is pretty good, but it gets a little fuzzy the louder you make it. It folds into a convenient cube for easy storage and it's perfect for the car, a party, or anytime!! Two thumbs way up!!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Small in size, HUGE in sound, volume and depth","I've had mine for a couple of months now and I enjoy them immensely! The comment from another reviewer is correct, the UEs bring the stereo sound to each ear individually and ultimately meld it in the middle of your head, it's wonderful!"
electronics,22 of 23,4.0,Worth the money,"The product is quite adequate and functions well.  Don't believe their suggestion to buy a 256MB SD card however, unless you are satisfied with 2 or 3 state coverage.  I got the 1.0GB SD card and it gives me detail access to over 2/3 of the lower 48 states.  I found a quirk while being instructed to enter a south bound highway from the east.  It instructed me to go over the highway and make a ""hard Left"" (an illegal turn), rather than make the right onto the cloverleaf entrance.  Be careful. --"
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,Not all digital devices work with all SD cards,"There are a number of people leaving reviews here that bash SanDisk, and I'm sure that their experience justifies their opinions.  But let me relate my own experience."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,It is amazing,When i plugged it in and couldn't believe the sound it was great.  It is compact and allows me to listen to music and charge my Zen.  It also acts a proctective case which is awesome and needed when it comes to me.  Its a great buy
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"A little pricy, but it was worth it.","This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5"
electronics,,5.0,GREAT MP3 FOR THE PRICE,I HAVE ABOUT 5 MP3 PLAYERS. SO FAR THIS ONE IS THE BEST. THE BATTERY LIFE IS EXCELLENT. HAS PLENTY OF SPACE FOR SONGS.VERY EASY TO USE.
electronics,,5.0,"A great alternative for a mouse, helpful for those with RSI","I've been using computers and mice for way too many years, and the ""switch the mouse from the right hand to the left"" trick wasn't working anymore. I tried out many mice and trackballs in the store, and this worked best for me."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Great Product, could use some extra Durability though","I have a cable going from the headphone jack on this product directly to my head unit, and the sound is better than any of my friend's iPod hookups.  This blows away FM Transmitters - the lack of bass on those makes the product worthless if you 'listen' to music rather than just want to 'hear' it."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,it works but is bulkier,"Bought one few months back...n i guess it is a gud investment for costly equipments...as other reviewers pointed out...it is quite bulky....the prongs always stick out,i am not able to carry it around in my laptop bag.....moreover for those of u, who travel a lot....NOTE: this things works only at 120V that means it will simply blow out when u will use it in countries which have higher voltage ratings.....APC do have other products which work at higher ratings to"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Defies the laws of physics?,"Despite the carefully worded description of the physics of light transmission, I found the TOS to TOS ILS200-1M made a significant difference in the sound quality compared with that of the OEM cable supplied by SONY. While the explanation of the physics is correct, the writer doesn't allow for variances due to execution. For example, very minor impurities in the materials that make up the body of the signal distribution unit can cause enough back flash to degrade/contaminate the signal even at the speed of light before it arrives at its destination. The wavelength of light and the frequency of this noise are not related. Granted, in most consumer quality FO cables, this is a very minor component of the delivered signal; does that justify spending $40-60 more for a HQ cable? That's a matter of personal preference and the capability of your biological sensors. In my case I think it was worth it as a luxury"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent,The Flash USB is the best...It also holds alot and it was a good deal...That USB cost more in the store..
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great little set,"I live 20mi out of the closest town in the mountains of Southern Oregon but have access to 3 translaters (CBS, NBC, PBS). The Axion picks up two of the three and if I move about enough I can get all of them. It runs on Batteries, 12v car pug in and AC so all the bases are covered. I was a little dissapointed in the short AA battery life but that was never important to me. It is a great little set for where I live and what I want it to do, mainly, for listening to local and national news while cooking dinner"
electronics,122 of 123,5.0,Finally a cordless phone system worth raving about!,"For those that already read my review of the Uniden CLX465, please allow me to recap a few things...."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,VERY disappointed,"When I first recieved this item, it functioned ""OK"". It worked every now and then. Lots of static and interruption. After having it only about a month or so, it started to fall apart... literally. All of the pieces came unglued and the item was forever destroyed. I had high hopes, but it turned out that it was just another cheaply-made transmitter. Not worth the $60 I paid. Very disappointed"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Awesome headphones,"I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I know when I'm hearing some good, clear sound."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excelent product!,This is the best protection for your Video ipod.
electronics,13 of 13,1.0,Deluxe Carrying Case is NOT deluxe,"The carrying case is so ridiculously small that it barely fits the Garmin Street Pilot, let alone the cord and any accessories. When you pay over $400 for a piece of delicate equipment you 1) expect to get a case with it or worst case 2)have the ability to purchase a case that truly protects the device and isn't a cheesy piece of junk. Garmin should be ashamed"
electronics,6 of 6,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"As has been mentioned in several of the reviews for this product, the lock has a tendency to ""forget"" the combination you have set. On THREE occasions, I had to start at 000 and try each combination one by one until I reached the new ""mystery"" combination that the lock had set by itself."
electronics,,4.0,good product for the price,Ordered this after doing a little research.  I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player that would give me a couple of hours of music while riding my motorcycle.  The size lets if fit perfectly inside my jacket and the sound quality is excellent for such a small device.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Works great. Includes 5 free software programs. 2 coupons.A+,"Works very well. I ran my CD and DVD ""test subjects"" thru about 10 times and the discs would physically start to curl up, like a potato chip."
electronics,5 of 12,1.0,Incredibly Disappointing,"Well after several days of research and much trial and tribulation I decided to purchase these at the local ""big box"" electronics store - they are going back in the morning.   I consider myself quite the audiophile although headphones are not my bag, at least not until I recently spent several thousand dollars on Mac systems, i-try-my-pods & laptops and thought ""what the heck, let's give personalized listening a try again""."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Port Computer Case,This is my 2nd Port product and I have been impressed with both
electronics,,4.0,Things to consider if you're getting a 2GB card,"I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone."
electronics,,2.0,Does not work as advertised.,I bought this ages ago and it has finally stopped working completely.  It's okay; I got about nine months of use out of it.
electronics,23 of 28,4.0,"Once you take it home, you see the real picture","I researched LCD TVs on the internet and went to stores before buying this TV. Out of the other brands, this one made more sense and looked better in its picture quality on display compared to the Phillips and Samsung. This one was more elegant and sleak. The sound quality was better too. The picture quality on displayed looked great so I went to Circuit City and bought it for $492 (Includes tax and recycling CA tax) on 11/30/05. I was happy with my purchase until I turned it on at home. Although the sound quality is superb, the picture is very dark. I've tried different settings to get a lighter picture unsuccessfully. The contrast on this LCD is 500:1, and I guess that's not enough. The resolution is also not great. I recommend the Sharp Aquos 15"" LCD TV for everything except the picture quality."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Casual Buyer Very Pleased,This was my first excursion into the world of quality audio and I like what I'm hearing.  Prior to this I just had $5 speakers and the occasional $10 headset for the easy mic access for my online games.   I got a tip from my roommate who is an avid Sennheiser fan to go with this brand.
electronics,,2.0,"Nice, but image is not great","Great design, it is definitely very compact. Installation was simple however the image on mine ""jumps"" every few seconds. This is very annoying to the other person. I contacted Creative support and they were not very helpful. Unfortunately, this one is going back..."
electronics,,5.0,Good reviev for this item!!!!!!,"The shipping was good, the card is perfect... I'm a satisfied customer :) what can I say.."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Awesome TV,We just purchased our Samsung 61' DLP and it's great.  I would definitely recommend it especially if you have HD cable.  I only have one problem and maybe someone can help.  We just had the Verizon FiOS TV install yesterday and on the HD channels everything is crystal clear and amazing but on the regular channels and especially if it is very bright/white the image is very blurry and text can be blurred too.  Also when there is a lot of quick movement on the screen I can see the pixels.  Is this due to my TV setting or my Verizon TV
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Great Item For The Money!!,Great for travel...Good sound...Great product for the money...Ordered on-line and received as promised
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,"Provides fast speed, but hangs frequently","I've been using WGT624 for many months and I am not satisfied with it. It hangs frequently. When it hangs you can't even access the router with a wire (LAN ports). It works only if you turn it off and on. I've always had the latest firmware updates, but none of those helped."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent tiny MP3 player,"I like that the unit uses a real battery size, rechargeables are nice in some devices, but in a MP3 player you really want a ""normal"" battery so you can put another one in anytime."
electronics,29 of 69,4.0,got it !,"I got my 37D90U yesterday, it came out of the Box, and blew my mind, this thing look amazing, very money !!."
electronics,2 of 6,1.0,just buy a new printer,"its cheaper to buy a new printer, which comes with the black and color cartridges.  I got a z65 for $50.  its nice to know we live in such a disposable world..."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Excellent Product,"Excellent product all around, but a bit pricey. I bought because radio-controlled units do not work well in my enviornment. Bluetooth works great"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Lack of useful technical support,"Problem was that the component video input (YPP) was non functional.  I did not find it possible to contact a real person at technical support and the ""phone tree"" menu is impenetrable, probably by design.  The email input option for requests resulted in an insulting,lame response to the effect ""If you connected your tuner to the YPP input, it should work.""  I would not have requested assistance if it had worked!  The component video output from the same tuner works fine with another HDTV I own"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,No brainer,Great price...I've had no problems at all. This one is a no brainer.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Deal,I recently purchased this item and I am very happy with its performance and quality. I use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Compact Flash Card,I ordered this for my daughter for her digital camera/camcorder and it was a great price for the size of memory card.  I have always been very satisfied with purchases from amazon.com
electronics,,5.0,"WOW, Amazing Price and Quality!",I just picked this item up for my 30 G Video iPOD. The kids can watch the TV shows and both hear out loud without wearing ear buds or fighting who gets to hold it. I picked this item up at Target today for 1/2 off on Clearance. It was only $74.99 VS the $149.99 that was advertised as the regular price. I was thrilled. Its great and I strongly recommend this to anyone. I would pay full price ANY DAY
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Fast Service,"The customers service and quality of service was excellent.  I received the order the same day that it was esimated to be shipped.  Previous to my order, I read consumer reports that provided positive reviews about the hardware and negative reports about the software that came with it.  I had purchased new software and had no problems"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,"Yes, I bought it. Yes I hated it. Yes, I returned it. Yes, they replaced it. No, it didn't work. No, I'm never buying it again.","I bought an iRiver back in January and oh my it was a nightmare using it. I took great care of it, used a case and everything but it was having trouble copying files after a month of working out with it. So I returned it under warranty time and got a replacement. Guess what? Same thing. I returned it again. I'm done with the iRiver"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good Value,"To start, this unit has a great picture. I did a fair amount of research before buying this unit and it didn't disappoint. I do have a few small quibbles such as the way using an external sound system is handled. When you use an external sound system the tv's audio functions are disabled and all controls such as volume and muting must be handled through your external system. I also would have liked a bit more flexibility in adjusting how non-high def signals are displayed. Overall this is a great machine and I would recommend it for the price"
electronics,8 of 10,1.0,Not for the new IPOD,"I got this as a Christmas present, and the person buying it knew what IPOD I had (IPOD Video), but there is nothing on this page or on the packaging to indicate what versions of the IPOD it works with.  So disappointed!  Amazon needs to modify the item description to indicated which versions of the IPOD this works with  and which it doesn't. "
electronics,,5.0,a nice charger,It tells you what it is doing. Some communication is better than none
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,"Solid keyboard, great feel, but aimed more at laptop users","In my ongoing quest for the perfect keyboard, I tried this diNovo (this is the regular RF wireless model, not the poorly reviewed bluetooth model).  My goal was a sturdy keyboard with excellent tactile feedback and relatively silent operation, no trailing wires, with little interest in gimmicks such as purpose-specific buttons."
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,Great value !,"Samson microphones have always been a good value - I use a pair of CO2 small diaphram condenser mics for live sound and recordings, and they easily outperform more expensive mics.  Generally, when recording, a lot of gear is needed - mics, preamps, mixers, digital recorder, etc, so it seemed like the Samson CO1U would be a really useful for quick recording projects.  "
electronics,20 of 20,5.0,Works as advertised!,"Previous dead spots in my house are gone - replaced with 80+% signal strength and high speed.  I was using a Netgear FWAG114 (dual-band b/g) but it couldn't reach everywhere.

electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Webcam,"I recently bought this product and I had a hard time installing the software. I could open the webcam center once and then after that it wouldn't open anymore. However, the picture quality is pretty good and only minor delay"
electronics,,4.0,Great phone..Great price.,I really like this phone. I like everything about it except the speakerphones that are built into the handsets.  The volume sometimes cuts in and out while using it.  That is really my only complaint with it.  It has excellent battery life.  It's small and compact and well worth the money
electronics,,4.0,Almost perfect product,"Just got a Video iPod and someone told me I had to get a case to provide it.  After reading a bunch of reviews I settled on the eVo3.  It is really great -- it really protects the iPod, but seems to allow all the funcationality one would want.   It's sleek, and if used properly, really works.  "

electronics,30 of 31,4.0,good for most things,This paper is great for most uses but it lacks the brilliant shine of the glossy paper.  Images are a bit darker and more matted out. But over all I still say this is good for most uses
electronics,,4.0,Sound quality is good.  Still a little big for traveling.,"The unit folds up nicely but the cord has what looks like a ballast that is almost the same size as the folded headset.  The sound quality is just fine, but I was hoping for a USB headset that was a bit smaller.  I now have it at office for Skype and dictation, hope to find a smaller one soon"
electronics,10 of 11,1.0,Combination mysteriously changed,"I had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble. All of a sudden, today, as I went to pick up the lock, which had been left untouched in the open position overnight with my combination in it, it decided to change combinations by itself. So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites. The fact that I even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock I can't rely on"
electronics,,4.0,Works great for me,"This is my third Plantronics headset and if I ever need another I will stick with plantronics.  The quality of all of them has been great.  I have seen other reviews that said you can't have the handset in at the same time, that is just wrong.  My handset plugs into my Plantronics base, you push a button to switch between them, very easy.  I also saw someone say the sound was bad.  I find just the opposite to be true, I have the volume all the way down on mine and some people are almost too loud.  Everyone hears me fine to, there are some 6 configurations settings and it took me a minute to find the one that worked the best for most of my calls.  I only wish the headset cord was a little longer, other than that this is a great replacement for my A100"

electronics,7 of 8,1.0,Piece of Crap is Pretty Accurate,"Tried it on two different car stereos.  On both, experienced no bass reponse and much treble distortion.  This is junk.  I'm beginning to believe that Belkin could care less about the quality of their products.  I had another attachment of their's for reading compact flash cards and had to trash that as well.  Same issues - extremely poor engineering (if they know what that is) and very unpleasant to use.  I feel like I was ripped off on both items"

electronics,3 of 6,4.0,OOOOH....Almost there,"I have to say I was very pleased with the ease of interfacing and manuevering. Have to say I did have a DOA, but Amazon was very fast and courteous about advance replacement and making me happy so I really have no complaints there. I have found that the output level isn't all that great when you connect up to an FM transmitter for your car, but as for headphone volume it kicks butt. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent phone,"I bought this phone for my parents, and even though they're technically challenged, they were able to plug it in, and get to using it quickly.  I would give this phone a try if you're looking for a simple phone, with out all the bells and whistles"
electronics,25 of 25,5.0,"Great 37"" LCD 1080p","You might be interested to know the exact width is 36&9/16"".  The picture is bright even at mid backlight and brightness settings.  I am more than pleased with its black levels and white contrast.  It also has minimal loss in picture quality at extreme viewing angles.  Glare from my room light is not as noticeable on this set as it was on my last TV.   This TV has a very good upconverter.  I supply it 480i, 720p, & 1080i through its HDMI input and even the 480i looks better than it did on my old 32"" Samsung CRT TV.   I actually prefer to watch 480i content on a non-HD station because the TV upconverts it to fill the screen whereas 480i content on an HD station is usually broadcast in 720p with side bars to maintain the 4:3 aspect which doesn't look good to me.  The 720p and 1080i content look amazing.  480p from my DVD through the component (RGB) video connection also looks great.  One negative I have may not be related to this set at all, but I'm not sure so I'll mention it... when I'm tuned to Discovery HD Theater, sometimes the camera panning action across a wide-angle view is jerky rather than smooth.  "

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Better than I expected,"I purchased this guitar for my 4 year old nephew over a year ago because he fell in love with Tim McGraw and wanted to be just like him.  He had a Wiggles guitar prior to this but had outgrown it and wanted a ""real"" one.  He treated everyone to an impromptu concerts as soon as he unwrapped the guitar and hasn't slowed down yet.  He regularly puts on concerts for the family dressed as Tim and even brings his little sister into the act as dressed as Faith.  He loves to play it every day.  While he has not begun lessons yet, he has now shown a consistent interest in playing guitar for over a year and his parents feel comfortable investing the time, energy and money in lessons.  I think this is a great guitar to buy as a toy or to test a child's interest and is probably good for very basic beginner lessons, but not anything more serious.  Being played daily it has held up beautifully without any problems. "

electronics,8 of 8,4.0,good product overall,"i just wanted to add that in addition to what everyone has said already, beware that this product rips easily. if you stretch the shirt a little, then your design will become ripped.  you also want to do a practice iron on an old shirt just to get acquainted with what part you peal off. hope this helps"

electronics,,5.0,"great product, great price","these headphones are a great deal-- the sound is quite good, and the sound isolation is very effective, which is key if you work in a loud office or take the subway to work, as i do.  after looking at many more expensive in-ear, sound isolating headphones i decided to give these a shot first, and i'm very glad i did"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Impressive,"The built is elegant, the 3-way configuration provides a balanced and wide frequency response (although sometimes a bit too heavy on the bass), and the system's low end response makes the use of most compact subwoofers unnecessary.  This is one pair of Sony speakers (next to the SS-MF750H with dual 8"" Kevlar bass drivers) any home cinema enthusiast should sample when shopping for a pair of main / surround speakers."

When they work, very good, but they will not stay tuned on same program. Emit loads of static and whistles.  Will only tune with volume at max on tv. Upstairs I have ARs & they work wondorously, even on low TV volume.  The ARs also emit a wider sound spectrum.  These RCAs are not as good as the speakers that came with my PC"

I had similar problems before when I purchased the incorrect media.  I would try and try to burn a dvd and got an error every time.  After tons of trouble-shooting, I realized that I needed this type for the hardware that I have.  I haven't had one problem since I changed.

electronics,7 of 10,1.0,Poor fit and performance,"I have purchased Saitek devices before, and have been happy with the product/price.  However, these headphones fall far short.  First off, unless you have a small head, I don't see how they can fit a person properly (I'm a hat size 7 3/8, large, I know, but there are bigger).  Even with the longest band, they pulled uncomfortably.  The actual earpiece/over the ear loop isn't very flexible either.  Then, the range (advertised at 10 METERS) is way overestimated.  I could only get to about 8 FEET with constant sound.  At 10 FEET, I got drop outs.  The sound itself wasn't bad, although at soft moments, you could hear a slight hiss.  Overall, if I could give this thing ZERO stars, I would.  These are on their way back"

And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,too much effort needed on index finger,This mouse is overrated. I am right handed and have struggled with tendinitis in my right index finger. Bought this expensive mouse hoping the effort required to press the buttons on the mouse will be very light. However to my dismay it is quite high even more than the cheap corded mouse'. Not worth it for my use. I need something that will be a relief to my stressed out index finger
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Competant Switch,"What can be said about a network switch?  It works or it doesn't, really.  I have no complaints about this switch, it works well.  I've had good luck with all D-Link hardware, really.  One interesting feature is that it has an indicator to show if a network device is connected at 10Mbps or 100Mbps.  I didn't know that one of my older computers had a 10M card in it until I got this switch"

I live in an urban area with many FM stations, and unlike another reviewer I have no problems with interference from adjacent stations. And the price!  How can you beat the price"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"I know it's got issues, but I like it fine...","I bought this cam about two weeks ago and I have been quite happy with it.  I was previously using the Logitech QuickCam Orbit which does indeed have better picture quality and motion possibilities.  But that cam was just too clunky for my current purposes (using a laptop with limited table space).  I haven't noticed that the picture is dark and grainy as a lot of reviewers have noted.  However, on my cam and computer, the picture does seem to be somewhat washed out and faded.  I can deal with this factor as the compact size is perfect for my purposes and, when clipped to the top of my monitor, it allows me to look directly into the camera allowing people to have a direct ""eye-to-eye"" view of me.  Yes, there are better webcams available.  But, for the price, I find this to be a great little cam"
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,I love this product!  Everyone should own one,"I work for a small business and we can't afford the risks of data theft.  Having this unit has put my mind to ease, especially since I work with very sensitive data. "

electronics,18 of 19,5.0,Excellent Package,"Let me add my accolades regarding this outstanding hardware/software package.  The unit is compact, considering all its functions, and easy to set up and use. It prints super images, makes excellent copies with one touch, and scans with high quality and ease.  The software works seamlessly with the hardware. I am especially happy with the scanning function. After so many years of marginal printers, and inferior multi-task machines, it is a great pleasure to own something that really works and delivers high quality images; and at a reasonable price.  I highly recommend this unit as an effective and reliable home/office machine."

electronics,5 of 7,1.0,Doesn't work with AIM,"The camera works fine with Yahoo Instant Messenger, and with the software that Creative includes with the product.  But we got the camera to use it with AIM which is what the rest of our distributed family uses.  Alas, neither AIM 5.9 nor AIM Triton displays anything from the the camera.  Creative's support has been frustrating.  They have suggested a number of things to do if the camera doesn't work at all, ignoring the fact that I've told them where the camera does work, and that we get the same results on two very different computers.  "
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Very bad purchase,"I was expecting a little more smooth control to this flash drive but it is so frustrating.  Some of the features did not even work with my jumpdrive such as hiding the ""secure"" drive.  I can never safely remove my drive from my computer because it always says it cannot.   The instructions say that the ""secure"" drive needs to be hidden in order for to safely remove it but it doesn't work.  It always takes so long just to get the thing safely out of my computer.  I could just pull it out but I'm afraid it could lead to data loss.  "
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Memory card error,"My review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently.  For some months after I first bought the card, it worked great.  Now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my Canon Elph, and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card.  Judging by what other customers have written, I'm suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between Canon cameras and Viking cards.  In any case, I will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a Viking"
electronics,3 of 5,4.0,Loomans review of Epson cartridges,"I have tried several other generic inks for my Epson printer. While they are cheaper and produce acceptable results, they do not compare with the Epson quality. Generics will use more ink and therefore empty much faster than Epson. I have also found that my printer clogs up more frequently when using generic ink. Overall I highly recommend Epson ink cartridges for those special pictures. Frank Looman"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Excellent all-in-one printer,"I bought this printer for my home office.  I needed a high quality printer that could print black-and-white text pages quickly, but also be capable of photo-quality prints.  I also wanted the fax capability that many of the all-in-ones lack."
electronics,,4.0,great product,have been using it since i received it and i have no problems. happy with my purchase.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Garmin Dash Mount,"In California, no windshield inside mounts are allowed. The Garmin Dash mount solution addresses this problem very well. It sticks to the dash and does not slide about. It is a little on the heavy side but the weight helps hold it in place. In a hard frontal auto accident it would be tossed into the windshield so there is some collison risk to your StreetPilot(but to you too). It has many pluses- high build quality, holds the GPS firmly, can be easily moved between cars, and has a charging jack built in. The minuses are few- heavy, might not fit a sculptured dash found in some cars, and its a little awkward to carry. Overall I am impressed with it"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Nothing bad to say about it...,This device arrived as a replacement for my 10bT hub.  The process of actually replacing it was just as easy.  I'm now getting the performance that I was seeking for my network...and at a great price
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,"So far, the best software that I've used. ","I've went through many softwares for music composition, including but not limited to composer, sibelius, finale, etc. However, I'd like to say that this is the best program that I have seen so far. The visualizations you get with the software (it's like controlling all the different equipments but with your mouse instead of your hand) as well as the awesome sounds (compared to the other programs I've used/standard midi sound - I believe reason uses sample recordings of actual instruments... the keyboard sounds are especially good). I do agree that this software is geared towards more of electronica music than the 'classical' types; nevertheless, this program provides far superior sounds as well as so many 'built-in sound controls' so that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars on those expensive equipments (unless you're a professional studio musician.. who have the financial resources to afford it)"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Looks good. Sturdy. ,"I put this in my home bar and it looks great. It is solidly built. I could not find a stud in the correct location so I put a large rectangle of plywood on the wall, painted it, and attached the bracket to it. The tv covers it and everything looks great."
electronics,7 of 37,1.0,Moving on to Bigger and Better,"I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant ""let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel"" navigation ""aid"" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion"
electronics,,5.0,"Great performance, good price","They keyboard has a much better feel than I expected. In fact, it does have little legs on the back that can flip down to put the keyboard at a slight incline if that feels better for you. The mouse is very responsive, which I had been worried about...I have a (cheaper) logitech wireless laptop mouse that has a slight lag whenever you begin to move it, this one has absolutely no lag and works great."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,1.4 cent cost per page not including paper and a real work horse.,"I have gone through two Brother HL-1250 printers that use this cartridge and it's a real work horse.  I've printed as many as 900 or 1000 pages in one day and it just keeps humming along.  I once tried to refill the toner myself and that was a disaster...black pages started coming out!  And yes I did empty the old cartridge before refilling it.  Now I just buy the toner cartages.  Its nice to be able to print a big document without worrying about jams or spending a fortune...or having to load paper that often.  I now use the pre-punched paper and my printing is easy and cheap!  The cartridge gets about 5,000 to 6,000 pages and the drum unit gets about 25,000 pages... so cost per page not including paper is around 1.4 cents.  Not too bad."

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,great and inexpensive portable radio,"The price of the radio is quite excellent!  Its only drawback is that the tuning is manual, and not digital:  due to the sensitivity tuning dial's small size, adjustment is often necessary, which a digital tuner would avoid.  However, a digital tuner would probably increase the radio's fantastic price"

electronics,0 of 1,4.0,They're good.,"All insulated earphones sound unnatural because they seal off the ear outside air, so the sound quality isn't as great.  Other than that, these are fine.  The purpose for these is for the sound isolation and it does that well.  If you're into sound quality, get the Koss Portapros which are complete open-eared so there is no sound isolation at all, but sound great because they're like speakers on your ears"
electronics,2 of 6,4.0,Nice card but too expensive,This is a nice card and all with amazing write speeds and some really good storage especialy onsidering its size. But this thing is just way to dang expensive. For the same price I can get 4x SanDisk 2 Gigabyte cards total 8 gigabytes. Although you have to give this card credit for having a lot of space in one card I just cant get myself to buy knowing I can get DOUBLE the space for the exact same price
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent for my purposes,"This product has an international plug set with adapters. This is something that wasn't entirely clear from the product description. Inclusion of these adapters means that you can use this, combined with your iPod mini, as a travel alarm clock just about anywhere in the world and wake up to any playlist you choose. This is great if you prefer to wake up to music like I do. It is also quite small and light. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Value Traveling Speakers,"Bought these for a trip to Mexico.  Very portable and did the job nicely to provide music in any location.  I bought the Zen Vision M and an AC Adapter - I use the same AC adapter for the Travel Speakers where possible.  Good sound as long as you are not looking for ""shake the house"" volume.  Decent output and around 4 hours of life on battery power.  Good value for the price in my opinion"

electronics,3 of 8,2.0,"Nuulooq, not so hot","I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today.  One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week....  There may be a device out there that will someday ""revolutionize my workflow"", but this isnt it, Back it goes..."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Extremely reliable!,"I've got 2 of these on my home network, and they are able to connect to the wireless lan where other's have failed.  I use the WPA-PSK mode, and it works perfectly.  Connection is always up."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Trackball,"I've been using kensington trackballs for over 10 years and have owned the Expert Pro (blue and beige), Turbo Mouse (4 button beige) and the Orbit. I have used this particular model for over 1 year. Still works great."
electronics,,5.0,Great keyboard,This is a great keyboard though it may take a little getting used to.  
electronics,29 of 32,5.0,Awww!,"These speakers work great, are affordable, and aren't they just the cutest little speakers you ever saw?"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Worth The Money!,This is my second 4gb memory stick and I plan on getting another one soon. I never had a problem with SanDisk
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very nice set of portable speakers,"Since I use headphones most of the time, I didn't want to buy a big speaker system. All I needed was an affordable pair of mid-range speakers that provided well-rounded sound for those times when I need them. This is exactly what I got."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Nice unit -  some areas for improvement,I'll try to add some additional perspectives to the other reviews.  
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Mapping on the Mac,"This piece of software is what I have been hoping for for since I bought my machine. It is the most elegant and detailed mapping system that I have used. With the Garmin Vista Cx it works flawlessly. You can download any or all of the map data from the disks into the ""Topo"" file and it runs very well on my powerbook G4. It will upload all waypoints, and routes. It will download all waypoints, routes and tracks! The maps are gorgeous! The interactive web feature is cool but young. It has a geocaching feature. The 3d maps are sweet! It downloads updates and new map layers almost perfectly (had to manually download the software update). I only wish that waypoints symbols would transfer to and from my unit but I can easily live without them. Load the Mapsource maps to your device (Garmin ""x"" series saves to swappable memory microSD cards) and use Topo! from your laptop"
electronics,15 of 21,1.0,This product is worthless,"Don't pay $350 for device that doesn't work.  GPS location at my house keeps changing addresses, none of which are my actual address.  So even if it were to actually text me that my dog is out of the fence (Which he is currently according to the command center) I would never really know where he is.  Bad product literature. You have to sign up for 2-3 year service cellular service plan that only gives you a certain number of ""out of fence"" alerts per month(3 on my plan and then additional charges for each alert) has yet to text me that my dog is out of the fence even though the web site clearly states he is out of fence.  Batteries only last a few hours when fully charged.  No piece of mind when out of town, or if he gets out and you were to actually know it, you would have very short amount of time to locate a dog that may be within a few blocks in any direction of the address it claims to be"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A GREAT buy!!!,"I had my doubts about buying this monitor, but it has the clearest screen and is easy to install and I love it.  I got it for a very reasonable price and it is worth twice as much as I paid for it. If you're looking for a decent priced and clear monitor, this one is it!!!"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Perfect companion to my T3,I'm using it for about 6 months with Palm Tungsten T3 and had no problems. It is much faster than my previous Sandisk 256 Mb. Unlike other users I did not experince any speed problem for both reading and writing and recommend it
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Wireless gaming is the best.,The controller is exactly like the Microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the T.V. and not having a cord in the way.  The controller works perfect
electronics,2 of 5,5.0,Excelente Pendrive de Titanio   ,"Este es el mejor pendrive Sandisk que he tenido no solo es resistente sino que se ajusta a cualquier tipo de computadora incluyen laptop, impresoras, etc. sin tener que conectarle ningun otro dispositivo. En verdad recomiendo los productos Sandisk que son excelentes ademas de estilisticos. Saludos..............Rafael de Cabimas, Venezuela"
electronics,,5.0,Easiest Switcher for two HDMIs,"At low price and ease of use, this was a smart buy. My TV only had one HDMI input and with two outputs (Hi-Def cable digital box and upconverting DVD player) I needed a solution. The switcher sits under my TV and switches easily, accurately and mechanically. All other switchers were very pricy. I only wish it was accessable by remote"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Strikes the perfect balance between portability and sound.,"Since these are not made exclusively for iPod (sans dock), it's important to know the setup for my review.  I use these for travel with an Apple Universal Dock with both a 30GB and a 60GB Video iPod.  Now, on to the review..."
electronics,3 of 5,4.0,These media worked fine on my computer,I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media.
electronics,,1.0,NOT Compatible with Phone that even Panasonic said was,"I purchased the KX-TG5776S phone system, and the Panasonic WEB Site shows this (TCA200) as an accessory (10-10-2006) BUT IT DOES NOT FIT THIS PHONE.  I called the Panasonic help and they told me I got the wrong thing that the TCA200 did fit that phone and that I should order it directly from Panasonic.  So like an idiot I did, and voila, its the same part, still doesn't fit.  Called Panasonic again, this time the person said they don't make a battery backup for the KX-TG5776S yet and that the ""other"" Panasonic person was mistaken.  Now I'm out over $20.00 bucks in shipping costs and still don't have a phone that works when the power goes out.  Its quite possible the TCA200 works, but just not with the Phone system I purchased. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very impressive,"These speakers were easy to install, and look great."
electronics,3 of 8,5.0,2nd generation done good,"okay, so its my birthday in three days, i always did want an ipod and my best friend didnt want me to get an ipod he was insisting that i should get a different kind of mp3 player, i did take his idea into consideration but i didnt like waht i saw or what i heard. so i went out and bought myself the ipod nano in blue...i like it sooo much you have no idea..its light yet durable, holds tons of songs, the blacklight is literally a mini flashlight, and yes...again its really light- you can carry it in your pocket and forgetits there i love my new ipod-its so simple and easy to us"
electronics,,4.0,Doesn't come with adaptor for Ipod video,"The Logic3 doesn't come with a cradle that fits the ipod video, however, if you send them a stamped envelope in the mail, they'll send the cradle to your house for free."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Be aware that it is USB 1.1 only,"It works well, but be aware that it is USB 1.1 only. I am not using it for my Epson RX620 scanner/printer, which is USB 2."
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,Compact & convenient,"I wish Targus made the same bag just a few inches wider.  My Toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag.  However, it does fit and I was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 Toyota Sienna with no problems.  There's also ample room for cords and DVDs. "
electronics,,5.0,Great little printer,"This printer is all it claims to be.  It is light, portable, fast and produces great printing.  I love it and take it with me on trips frequently."
electronics,1 of 4,4.0,Things to consider if you're getting a 2GB card,"I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Ipod Case,"I had the old eVo2 for my older Ipod, and it was virtually indestructible in the case. I'd fall out of my pocket, or I'd drop it by accident, knock it off my desk without a scratch, I'd fall on carpet, hardwood floor, tile, concrete, pavement, everything, and not one scratch! This thing was great, so i decided to buy the eVo3 for my new Ipod, and this thing works just the same, but now its even better. There is a cover over the wheel to protect that (and it doesn't affect the control over the wheel), and the screen protector is even thicker. its comfortable to hold, and it has a nice cover for the plug on the bottom, I feel safe knowing that my Ipod won't get hurt inside it. The only thing is that the case can make a little bit of crud on your Ipod, but that can be wiped off right after you take it out of the case. And compared to other manufactures it may be a little pricy, but I have a lot of faith in this company so its worth it if your willing to pay a little extra"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works well.,"What can you really say about these things...make sure you get a good seal in the ears, the correct size is needed for proper fit and comfort.  Try a few different sizes and types to see which you prefer, keep extras on hand for other people"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,verbatim is the best,"this blank media is the most relible product thus for. Maybe 2 (two) disc's out of 300 may fail, not 20-25 out of 50 like some blanks do. Very relible!!!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Must Have!,This is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot.  If I leave my laptop somewhere I hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad.  This is really small and compact! Perfect for traveling too.  I've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem...it still recoils well
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"SNES games, this is perfect.  No configuration needed.","Once plugged in, it was recoginized right away by Win XP.  Playing SNES emulator games this one is perfect.  Crisp control and good ergonomics.  Nice looking gamepad has all the buttons needed for SNES. "
electronics,4 of 5,2.0,"mediocre, you get what you pay for",fortunately i didnt pay much for this.  
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,It's the best,  If you want the very best in hands free wireless telephoning then this is the product for you.  It may cost a bit more than some other products of its kind but it is worth every penny
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Sony MDR-V600 Studio Monitor Series Headphones Deliver,Pound-per-pound and Dollar-for-dollar the Sony MDR-V600 Studio Series Headphones deliver punchy clear audio and refuse to ever distort or blow out. The Circum-Aural Earcup Design make these recomended headphones a joy to wear for long hours in the studio. Sony Headphones last beyond their expected years and I highly endorse them.
electronics,,5.0,Think Outside Stowaway Wireless Keyboard ,"You can carry this in your pocket, take it anywhere. It really works"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,iPod hi-fi home stereo,compared all others of this type and this is the best. it costs more but you get what you paid for. excellent sound from this type of stereo
electronics,8 of 8,1.0,Let the buyer beware,This phone did not work. I called the Panasonic service center and was told that items bought on Amazon did not have a warranty since Amazon was not an approved retailer. Finally was able to get a return voucher which I did not use since the additional mailing charge would have almost equalled what I had already paid for the phone.
electronics,5 of 9,2.0,Middle of the road or on a clear day.,"These GMRS radios have very limited range on land.  If on water and in a low radio noise area they actually may get 18 miles but everywhere else maybe only two miles on hilly land and 0 feet if behind a hill.  It's not the GMRS radio but the frequency in the VHF band.  There are repeaters which will extend the range.  The NOAA radio section works very well but I have not USED the alert portion.  Over all it was what I expected.  Don't count on the advertisment of ""18 miles.""  Also, you need an FCC license to use this radio.  $85, and it cannot be used for business purposes, although I see this all the time.  This could cause you to have a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in the pokey if you disrupt communications"
electronics,17 of 18,5.0,The Best Solution For The Money,"As I started building my portable music studio (laptop, mic, amp...) I ran into one major setback.  The soundcard in my laptop just couldn't handle the quality of audio I was trying to record.  For the price, this definitely seemed to be the best solution."
electronics,38 of 38,4.0,Works--with quirks--but nice perks,"I haven't had nearly as much trouble with this recorder as some of the other reviewers, but I can corroborate stories of some of its flaws. It's designed to be quite sensitive but that often leads to distorted recordings, especially if you have to try to record someone over speakerphone. If you don't press record within a few seconds of plugging in the unit, the iPod goes to sleep and you've got to do the two-finger reboot, which is inconvenient and might cost you the beginning of your interview. And I, too, have heard some hard disk access noise on some of my recordings. (I haven't had issues where it failed to record at all--not yet, anyway.)"
electronics,3 of 5,4.0,We can finally hear clearly,"WE were stuck in the past with our old 900mhz phones. After several visits from the phone company repair man, we finally realized the incoming lines were not the problem."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Last WAY longer than alkaline,"These are my first rechargeable batteries, so all I can say is that in comparison to alkaline, these are WAY better and longer losting.  Alkalines stop working in digital cameras long before they are actually used up, because they can't supply the required current for high-demand devices.  These Sonys last much more than 4x as long because alkalines only work for a few minutes.  These Sonys maintain their voltage at a stable level.  I am using them in an Olympus C-755 digital camera, and I charge them using the Sony BCG-34HE4 charger.  I can't say exactly how many pictures you can take on one charge, because they last for so long I lose track.  If you have a digital camera, you absolutely must use rechargeable Nimh batteries.  Don't waste your money on the expensive ""high-end"" alkalines or non-rechargeable lithium, etc.  Also, you are doing the environment a favor by not using toxic landfill filler"
electronics,6 of 12,4.0,apple does it again,"I have just gotten my blue ipod nano. It is so cool! My dad and I downloaded itunes in advance, and we just put some songs on it. I don't know if we did it wrong, but it took a long time to just put three songs on my ipod. The ipod has a really nice color, but it looks extremely delicate. I am afraid to just leave it in my pocket. You should definetly get one, but be sure to buy a case for it!"
electronics,,5.0,"Very nice cable, excellent construction","I got one of these for $16.97, on clearance at Radio Shack (from $69.99).  At this price, it was worth it, but I could never pay $50 for one.  Best bet is to get a used or open-box one from a place like Ebay, for much less"
electronics,,5.0,Buy It,"I couldn't find this adapter locally, so I turned to Amazon.com.  Naturally I found it.  The price was right, I received the advertised rebate, and the product works as advertised.  What more can you want"
electronics,13 of 14,2.0,"These are not that good, I'm returning them.",The Sony instructions state that these work most effectively on lower frequencies.  I found that these do not really work that well in any frequency range.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,awesome batteries,"Like serveral below, i am using these with my Canon S2 IS.  I think they are awesome.  I'm very picky about battery life and i think these last great.  i don't have them long enough to know if they diminish over time.  I used these battery in a mini tape recorder too.  It lasted over several days at 1 hour record time each day.  I do have an 8 hour charger and it doesn't bother me one bit.  Haven't anyone heard ""faster isn't better?""  I wouldn't trust the 15minute charger.  who knows what it does to the battery.  i am content with waiting for 8 hours and be sure my battery recieves a complete charge.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,This is a terrible DVD player,It is very difficult to get the player to play many of my DVD titles that work just fine elsewhere.  It also takes an abnormally long time for the unit to recognize and play a DVD.  It responds sluggishly to commands and it frequently just freezes and will not respond to any commands.  I would stay away from this thing
electronics,0 of 3,4.0,Memorex 8x  4.7GB,They are ok for their price. I'm more concerned about how long they would last
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,These DVD's are really good... ,These DVD's are really good... I have yet to have any problems..
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,review on Koss M-18 Electret Microphone,it works well till now. The shipping is fast. Thank
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,first one faulty,Works well with no static.  Cord on the first was faulty keeping it from getting the fifth star
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works as expected,"This is my 3rd Intellimouse Optical. I will be using this on my notebook, because the smaller notebook mouses seem to be giving me carpal tunnel."
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,MAKE LAP TOP TO DESK TOP,LOVE THIS ITEM DON'T LIKE LAP TOP KEY BOARD AND TOUCH PAD BUT LOVE LAPTOP WITH THIS ITEM IT IS LIKE TAKING MY DESK TOP WITH ME WITH MY FOLDING KEY BOARD AND SMALL MOUSE
electronics,8 of 11,4.0,"Good for what it is, but not in combination","This armband is good for what it is: Something to keep your iPod mini secure while you're working out, or doing other activities you want to have your hands free for.  The band is wide enough that it's comfortable, but it's not too big and clunky for a smaller person.  The band itself is well built and secure."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,A good mouse,"I like the extra buttons, especially the thumb button.  Be warned however this mouse is definitely ergo-designed for a righty. The side-scroll feature is a good idea, but in practice, it takes some dexterity to hit it just right and NOT also scroll up or down.  Hmm, let's just get on with the pros and cons and be done. :)  As for the PRO's, I haven't discovered anything brilliant that hasn't already been mentioned.  Let me get to the details that might persuade you away from the mouse. I find if I can just get to the negatives about a product I can make a much quicker decision. So with that said:"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,12c and 15c - Best calculators ever,"I'm really a 15c user, absolutely saddened to find out that it is no longer produced. All the good things that are said about these wonderful machines are true. "
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,headphones,Excellent sound quality. Fits well over the head or from behind. Lifetime warranty also
electronics,,5.0,excellent,"This is an excellent, reliable product. I bought 2 because of the outstanding sale price"
electronics,,5.0,Reliable and quick performer,"Bought this card as a backup for the 1-GB card I normally use, and it's been fast and dependable so far. My 7 megapixel camera produces large files -- lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting, but with this card that hasn't happened yet. Good purchase."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Why pay more?,"If you can get your hands on the 2-part review Sound & Vision Magazine did comparing many of the top rated subs, you will begin to understand what these Amazon reviewers are trying to say regarding the quality. Combine that with the extrordinarily low price, and you have an absolute steal when it comes to supplying your home theater with the low end required to make movies and music come to life. I've had mine for about 2 yrs now and couldn't be happier. At these prices, why not buy two if your room is a little on the large side, or even if you just are looking for that absolute bass ""holy grail"" in a conventionally sized room. You won't regret either"
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,I have a job as a PSO and this is the best phone to use so you can do everything around the house and be ready when you get a call. It's an awesome phone. If there are any other PSO's  out there get this phone
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Price Dispute,"I think that the 60GB iPod model is really great, as you can back your hard drive up to it and still have room for music, but I was surprised to see the price listed on this website.  This site listed the price for the 60GB color iPod as 450USD, but the official Apple price is only 400USD, and the student price is 370USD.  "
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Excellent System for Price.,If you want a budget home theater system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the Sony HT-DDW700. This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room.
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Everything works well except for scan feeder,"Everything works fine on this machine. Scan is excellent if I use the flatbed/glass. Problem comes when I want to scan multiple pages using the feeder. Page goes in and gets stuck half way forcing me to pull it and re-scan it. Sometime when I pull it, I manage to tear it off."
electronics,6 of 9,5.0,Alexcl,"This Bose system is great and completely lives up to the Bose name.  We installed this system in our family room which is long and narrow and difficult to run speaker wires.   We had a traditional Home Theatre system with the 5 speaker and bass set up and we were not satisifed.  First of all, the system was so complicated to set up that we never felt we were fully utilizing it's capabilities and it sometimes didn't function as we felt it should!  Secondly, you had to hassle with all the speaker wires run everywhere!  We decided to invest in this Bose system and it is GREAT!  Simple set up and operation and the sound literally fills the room.  We first heard the Bose system at a Sam's club and if the acoustics can sound good in a warehouse setting, imagine how good it can sound in your home!  Well worth the money and so simple to set up that a child could do it"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,It amazing tecnology at affordable price...............,"It a incredibly component sounds superb , the bass are high enriched sound in the room , perfect mate for computers and laptop"
electronics,,5.0,This keyboard is awesome!,"I have the blue version also, I recently purchase the red one. For me this is great becuase the computer I use for games is in a dimely lit room, sometime with only the TV and the computer on. So I struggle constantly to see the letters on the keys. Not only does this keyboard look cool, I can see the keys! I wish I had thought to look for one of these a long time ago. You can also adjust the brightness of the light. "
electronics,,5.0,Satisfaction Plus,"This Monitor more that satisfied what I was looking for in a Monitor.  The color is just great, Everything is clear and the size is fantastic. I especially like that it is taking up so much less space on my desk because of it's thin build. The price was right too, which was a big factor in the choice of this monitor.  Everything in one package!!! what more can you ask?!!!  I like it!!!"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Works great when it works,"I love the DVD-RAM capability. Unfortunately, I've had some trouble with the ""chasing playback"" feature that is supposed to allow me to watch one show on the disk while recording another. Sometimes the machine freezes up when I use this feature (and a firmware upgrade on their website didn't fix this). But that is a relatively minor problem that I'm willing to live with. "
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Easy to Install and Works Perfectly,"The good: Windows XP recognizes it.  All you do is plug it in.  I already had roxio software installed, and it recognized it as a drive, so I didn't bother installing the supplied software."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Garmin Dash Mount,"My motivation to purchase this was not because it is illegal to windshield suction mount in CA, but because I wanted to be able to easily move between cars. Also, to be able to easily move it from the tempting dash location when parked to a less conspicous place. It works perfectly on both counts! I did put a bit of velcro under the center and also a spot on each dash as my driving is a bit spirited at times."
electronics,11 of 11,4.0,"Close to perfect, at least for me","I bought a pair of these in 2004 to use primarily with my laptop.  I'm not a huge audiophile, but I do expect much better sound than built-in computer speakers can deliver, and as I sometimes spend 12+ hours working at my computer, I needed something that wasn't going to be torture on my ears/head.  I have a very small head, so I wanted the self-adjusting strap to keep them snug and comfy, and of course the fact they're collapsible makes them easier to transport."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Print pack a great buy!,"After using picturemate print pack I saved alot of time and money, because I have printed over 300 photos in the last several weeks and didn't have to go outside my home to buy ink and printer paper. The print paper gives you good quality finished photos. Thats a great deal and a good buy for me. Thanks Epson"
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,This phone is terrible,"If you want to spend all day trying to figure out the manual, you have come to the right system. I'm still having a hard time looking for a 4 line phone that's easy to install and easy to use. The panasonic that we had died on us 9 months into it. And that one was fine."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Just to clarify how splitters work and dB loss...,"The review below about the Adelphia splitter working better than this one is misinformed.  All splitters cause signal loss of the split signal -- this is unavoidable (unless the splitter also has a powered amp).  Typically this is approximately 3.5dB per split (for 1GHz or less, more above that).  The Adelphia splitter was no doubt a 3-to-1 split: the incoming signal was split once and one of the split signals was split again.  Thus one output is -3.5db and the other two are -7dB (2 x 3.5).  What the Monster splitters do is split the input evenly across all outputs, which really only helps when there are 3 outputs resulting in a -5.7dB drop across all outputs instead of one -3 and two -7.  The 2- and 4-way splitter outputs are the same as you'd get from Adelphia or otherwise (either split once or split twice).  Clear as mud?"
electronics,,4.0,Nice to buy them all at once,"I use alot of this ink in my business so it is convenient to be able to buy the four together. I would be nice if ALL the inks(includingthe PGI-5BK) were packaged together. The price of printer ink has always been a bone of contention with me, but we are at the mercy of the printer manufacturers. With that said, the price on this four pack is not the worst especially with free shipping or Amazon Prime"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Amazing quality for computer speakers,"I normally listen to music on a very high quality system in the living room. For the last year or so I've also been using a pair of Sennheiser HD-600 headsets while working at my computer. Those are as close to the 'reference' headsets used in recording studios as will still let me hear my sick wife when she needs me. Basically, my standards are high, and these Altec Lansing speakers have not disappointed me. I would have been willing to pay up to five hundred for the quality these provide."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,High Quality tapes,Bought these high quality tapes for my Cannon ZR700 minidv camcorder and these tapes are superb. Thanks to Amazon for the super fast delivery and fantastic packing. I will order from amazon 
electronics,,4.0,Nice headset,"I spend a lot of time during the week on calls.  This headset makes that more manageable (and allows me to actually get some work done in the process).  My Avaya VOIP phone has a headset button and  a dedicated port, so I can seamlessly switch between this device and the normal method.  The sound quality is good and the LED that  signals that you are on a call is a great idea."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent,It was so easy to setup the handset with base station. Good signal and it's wi-fi friedl
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,A must for home theater systems.,"I purchased these cables in connection with a new Toshiba DVD player, and it sure makes a difference in the audio quality over my old audio cables.  If you enjoy high quality audio with virtually no distortion or  interference, monster audio cables are a must"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,These work like a charm,"(3/18/06) I read lots of reviews in which people say their earphones fall off and are not worth anything.  I guess it all comes down to the shape/size of people's ears.  These fit my ears like a glove.  I don't even realize I am wearing them.  I'm currently traing to run a marathon; I run a lot.  So far, the farthest I've ran with them was twelve miles and I had not problems at all.  I only paid $10.00 for them; if they break, that's fine; the usage I've gotten out of them so far has been worth every penny (and I'm confident I will get many more miles out of them before I need to get new ones.)"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Plug It In and Forget About It,"Yes, I installed it (easily) and then forgot I had it.  Just purchased a second one for another PC.  Really, even I couldn't screw this up"
electronics,,1.0,incredibly disappointed,"this product is terrible. all i heard was static, even if i placed it next to the car stereo. i ended up returning it and purchasing the road trip one. it costs more but i haven't had any problems with it"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Convenient, Easy to Carry","I've had one of these for the past several years, using it on and off when wireless wasn't an option.  It has served me well and I really like how compact and convenient it is to use.  I find the build sufficient but nothing that couldn't be destroyed with a hard knock.  When using it, one has to be sure that the cable isn't recoiling all twisted or else that would damage the auto-retract.  I haven't had a problem with the retraction yet.  I don't use the telephone adapter too often but in the rare cases that I needed it, I was very happy to have this product on hand.  It saves me from carrying an extra cable and the telephone cable is sufficient for times when Ethernet isn't an option.  The only thing I would want more from this product is a longer cable but I don't know how that would affect the size of the product.  6' is sufficient for most situations but I wouldn't mind an extra 4' or more.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry around a phone/ethernet cable without the bulk/inconvenience of carrying the regular cables.  It is functional and understand that it isn't built like a tank and it'll serve you well as it has for me"
electronics,,5.0,Best wired mouse you can buy,"It feels great, it works great and the software is actually useful"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great wireless mouse for the $$,"While using a PowerBook G4, this mouse works great. The battery life is fantastic. I haven't had to change the batteries yet. It's been well over two months of heavy use now. Set-up was a breeze. The only issue I have with it is that the tracking is a little too fast for my taste. I tried to slow it down by one more increment, and that turns out to be way too slow. End result: I had to get used to a slightly faster tracking than I am used to.  Otherwise, this product works perfectly.  Great value for the money"
electronics,4 of 25,1.0,Shipping and handling,You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great little option!,"I was a little skeptical of this apparently quite minimal attachment for the Etrex series.  It didn't seem like a very substantial device especially when considering that it is expected to hold a rather heavy GPS unit to your handlebars over rough terrain, and I knew I, at least, would be subjecting it to some pretty jarring trails."
electronics,24 of 25,4.0,So far more positive than negative,Pros:
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great value,"Extremely good picture for the price.  The upconverted 1080p output looks great on my 1080p HDTV (Sony 55A2000) when connected over HDMI.  This player uses the same basic technology (Faroudja DCDi) as the highly-rated but slightly more expensive Oppo OPDV971H.  If you own a 1080p TV and don't want to buy an expensive video scaler, the Samsung HD960 provides a very nice compromise solution for producing high-def output from your standard-def DVD's"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great unit for the price,"We own a Bed & Breakfast and we needed an inexpensive compact DVD player to move around to connect to TVs in our guest rooms when required to play DVDs. After lots of looking I chose the Coby DVD-224 and it meets the need very well.  It has all the features needed, a good remote and it works well.  In fact this review is following the purchase of our 2nd one, and we will probably buy more.   We use these units only occasionally so I can't comment on long term durability.  Based on our needs and use I can certainly recommend the unit. For $30 it is hard to go wrong"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Product! Lots of space :),"This memory stick is a great buy.  You will not regret it.  With this memory stick you get plenty of speed, space, and reliability.  I love having 2 gigs of space on my PSP.  I put a bunch of music on it, a few videos, and still have plenty of game save space.  If you are thinking about getting a lower sized memory stick, dont do it.  It is worth it to have the extra space"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,works great!,"works great, a real neck saver, the only draw back is the noise it creates while someone is on hold, and it is directly in your ear through the earpiec"
electronics,,4.0,Travel dock,"Great little product. Gives good sound for its size. The remote works fine, except for the delay after you push the button. Wish other companies produce products for the Zen. It's almost like carrying a brick in your pack"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works perfect as expected,"I would not hesitate to buy more of these when I need them. They are great to use for power strips to fit more ""oversized"" plugs. They also work well if you want to plug 2 ""oversized"" plugs into a wall socket"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Retractable vs Cap,"Yes, it has a retractable USB connector.  Nice.  For me, however, the force required to insert into the extension cord is enough to cause the connector to retract.  I need to hold it open with my thumb while I insert the drive."
electronics,,1.0,What a piece of junk. Don't buy this,"This so-called ""travel charger"" didn't charge my battery. On the contrary, it seemed to DIS-charge it. I plugged this in, tried to turn my iPod on, and get the ""Battery exhausted"" error. I had to plug it into the computer and leave it there for 5 minutes to even get it to sync with iTunes. The reason why I bought this was to charge it WITHOUT plugging into the computer. But this didn't work, so it defeats the purpose. Oh well...."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Compact Flash Card an excellent buy,"I purchased this flash card to take on vacation so that I would have enough room for all of the pictures I planned to take.  I had no problems at all with the card, with the images it produced, or any transfers.  I used the card in a Nikon 8800, and now use it as my primary memory.  I recommend this card to anyone for its high quality, and low price.  It is a good value"
electronics,,5.0,The joystick that you need,"It works wonderfully with all types of games, Specially sport games. You will not miss a single move action because of your joystick... I highly recommended it.."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Sleeve is just what I wanted!,"This sleeve is just what I wanted to protect my personal laptop.  It fits my Toshiba Satellite 15.4"" notebook with room to spare.  I wanted to keep it snug inside of my carying case, and this is just the perfect thing.  Very practical.  I recommend this for any laptop owner that wants to prolong the life/appearance of their machine"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,This remote is great for RCA products....,"I bought this remote as a replacement for one I broke. I have a Proscan television. Proscan is a company affiliated with RCA. This remote works great. There are a few extra buttons I rarely use, but I don't mind. This remote even works with my JVC boom box. I can't do as many things as I can with original JVC remote, but I can at least play CDs. You should really only buy this remote if you own RCA products. If need a remote for any other of the major brands, buy a more generic remote"
electronics,0 of 3,5.0,Christmas Gift for my daughter,"I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it!  I helped her download the software, drag and drop the files, etc.  It was surprisingly simple. "
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Best bang for the buck,"This is by far the best 17"" LCD monitor in its price range. Quality is very good. No dead pixels at all. The monitor comes packaged very well and is very light. This monitor replaced an HP 19"" CRT monitor and there is no difference (very little) in terms of the viewable screen size. This is the best choice for a money minded consumer looking for a decent 17"" LCD monitor."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Mouse & Keyboard combination a winner,"The Think Outside Bluetooth Stowaway Travel Keyboard & Mouse arrived the day before I had to go to a meeting in Palm Springs. By the time I got to the meeting I was up and running with both. They worked flawlessly, although the learning curve is a bit steep at times with the keyboard. No problems at all with the mouse. Not having a number row on the keyboard keeps its footprint small, but adds a couple of function keys; that takes some to to adjust. That said, I felt completely at ease leaving my laptop at home; this combo makes my Axim x51v a real workhorse in meetings. "
electronics,9 of 9,1.0,Looks are decieving...,"I bought this unit 11 months ago on sale from a local department store that said it was marked down 70% from $100.00 to $30.00. I thought that I was getting a good deal. I loved the design, it's compact size and the sound quality wasn't too bad though it could use more bass. A week ago it began to stop in the middle of play and two days ago it stopped reading CDs altogether. I used a CD cleaner, no change. I called Coby Customer Service and they told me I could ship it back to them and for $31.00 they would fix it and send me a new one. Huh??? When I asked if that meant they would send me the repaired one too they said no they would just send me a new one (for $31.00). So I said ""So...basically you are just telling me to buy a new one. No thanks."" It's not worth $30.00 and it certainly wasn't worth $100.00"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Functional for a cheap price,I got the charger adapter to use on a trip and it fulfilled my need of having a way to charge my iPod away from my computer. I was close to buying other devices for 5 times the price until I found this and read all the good reviews about it. I haven't had any problems with it so I highly recommend it
electronics,,4.0,Great bang for the buck.,"Headphones sound great, wireless range is great, and owning two of these products makes it good for my wife and I to watch programming such as horror films or movies with lots of bad language when the kids are asleep."
electronics,,4.0,good for travel,I purchased this with no expectation.  We travel often and I have the Bose speaker at home but it is too bulky to travel with.  The sound quality isn't great but for the size and the fact that it can be used with batteries it definitely does the job.  Not only for travel but I have found myself moving it around the house even taking it to friends houses because it is so easy to move about.  For the price you can't beat it.
electronics,,5.0,Wow!!!,"Very nice Up-Converting player, went from a Toshiba player and it has much more detail and sharpness. Plus the DVI-HDMI cable is included! It can be upgraded with firmware to enhance future functions and features. Highly Recommend it"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,I lost mine and was lost without it,"This is something you probably won't fully appreciate until you've had one for a while and then lose it. You may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control. But once you get used to having one, you'll find the convenience and functionality are habit forming. The one I lost was in daily use for 3 or 4 years and continued to work well"
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,This thing has real problems,"Ok, I installed it and it worked flawlessly with WEP.  Then I went on the road and again it worked flawlessly connecting to a public wi-fi without WEP.  When I got home, with the same configuration as a week earlier it wouldn't connect.  It either tells me the WEP key is incorrect (which I know it's not as I had another machine that connected just fine) or that the WEP key must be ten characters (which it doesn't).  I even installed it on an other laptop and it gave the same error.  And, I put the other laptop's card in and it connects just fine."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Logitech mm50 Portable Speakers for iPod black,This is a well designed and manufactured product which lives up to its promise.  The sound from fairly small speakers is well balanced and rich with good detail and solid bass reproduction. It successfuly reproduces a wide range of music of different genres from an iPod and is easy to set up and use.  The fact that it can be charged from a wide variety of power sources both in the USA (110V AC 60 Hz) as well as in Europe (typically 240V 50Hz) is a particularly useful feature which was a deciding factor in my purchase as a UK resident.  This item is very good value for money
electronics,14 of 45,1.0,Apple has lost my respect,"I am happy to see competing MP3 players make inroads.  I think people are going to get burned out on iPods.  The competition is catching up and there are and will be better alternatives for less.  I might have jumped on the iPod bandwagon, but decided to add up the costs before doing so.  No thanks.  For flash players, Sandisk and Creative have some pretty good ones with FM stereo and recording capabilities.  I got a Sandisk 1G on sale for about $30 -- plays WMA, MP3, FM, Audible audio books.  I like the post of the person who itemized all the expen$e$"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Best all around for over 30 years!,"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a ""Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.""  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen"
electronics,4 of 5,2.0,Ouch!,I have several complaint about this mouse...
electronics,7 of 8,4.0,"Blocks Most Noise, Are Comfortable","I bought these headphones to help me study in loud enivronments.  They block the majority of noises, including traffic, people yelling, stereo/television noise from next door.  They won't block out loud noises in the same room (e.g. loud TV or person yelling), but I think that's good because you want to be aware of dangers nearby!"

electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Broke down in six months ,"I am very disappointed with this product and Panasonic. The dvd recorder is barely used since we bought it in February 2006. A week ago when I tried to finalise a dvd+r it just froze, after trying to reset the dvd recorder I received a split screen on TV. Now the recorder does not recognize any dvd format other than the dvd-rom and does not record on anything. We will have to take it for repair. Hopefully it will work again."
electronics,7 of 8,1.0,It doesn't work for me,"I am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks ... unfortunately without success. I bought the bundle #3 (Bluelogger & Street Atlas 2005 & Street Atlas 2005 Handheld). The installation went fine, but I had problems in hooking up to bluetooth. I had to reset my HP iPAQ 2215 several times in this process and my IBM T30 (2.4 GHz and with 1GB RAM) was very slow ... not sure why this was."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Excellente product!,It's extremely easy to install and get up and running. It works perfectly and I believe is a great product. Worth every penny
electronics,,4.0,No major problems,"I bought this external hard drive about six months ago when my computer began exhibiting signs of old age and music overload.  I have been able to store at least 60GB of material on it so far with ZERO problems.  For the most part it works flawlessly.  Setting it up was a little confusing mostly because the instructions are somewhat bungled.  My only complaint with the hard drive itself is an intermittent buzzing sound that comes out of it.  But, overall, I am very pleased with it"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Snap, Shoot and Listen All You Want With Your LG VX8300","I bought this to use with the Verizon LG VX8300.  It worked right out of the box, no problems.  With this you can shoot all the photos and video you want and take along a lot of music as well.  I use the included SD adapter to transfer music and photos between the phone and laptop.  My laptop has an SD slot built in.  If yours doesn't you'll need to use a card reader."
electronics,,4.0,"Buying yellow, seeing red.","Amazon is currently getting almost three bucks more for the yellow Canon cartridge than the other colors--a curious discrepancy because the other sellers that I checked are pricing all Canon colors uniformly.  I'm still ordering from Amazon because their postage-free policy erases any price advantage.  (If it's any consolation, the yellow cartridge lasted practically twice as long as the cyan and magenta ones."

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great DVD Recorder with chasing playback,"This is a great DVD recorder! It has multiple recording media choices, including DVD-Ram, with 5 picture quality modes.  If you use the DVD-Ram it can start recording and then let you go back and watch the recording from the beginning while it's still recording the rest of the program. Sort of Tivo-like. Great if you are interupted and want to go back and see what you missed while the program is still recording.  Editing functions, one touch recording, scheduled recording and all with great picture quality. This recorder has enough bells and whistles to make techno-geek types happy but easy enough for the rest of us. I'll never use all the functions but love the way I can just stick in a ram disk, hit record button and away it goes. I've owned my recorder for 3 months and had no problems. Like all the new technology - do yourself a favor and read the manual before you set it up. I looked at a lot of models before I bought and this was the one with all the features I wanted. I have NOT been disappointed"

electronics,,5.0,"A nice mouse, easy install","I own a Toshiba M200 tablet pc. It has extensive facilities for bluetooth devices. I use a Canon IP90 bluetooth printer. That works flawlessly. I pulled the mouse out of th package, installed the batteries, and it fired right up, broadcasting for a bluetooth connection. I started the bluetooth manager and the two married immediately. Now, a minute later, I'm using the mouse very easily. It has a nice pearl finish and works smoothly. My only complaint is that it doesn't scroll enough lines per turn. When I spin the wheel it scrolls about half what a normal scroll button does, but I might be able to adjust that through the mouse device settings in the control panel. I'll revisit with more information on battery life and so on. Get it if you know how to set up bluetooth, an excellent investment"

electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Works great!,Just plug it into your PCMIA port and on my computer with Windows XP it automatically detected the device and installed the necessary drivers. I may have had to visit the company's web site to add aditional drivers to get the card to work as USB 2.0 instead of normal speed USB ports but it works great now. You also may need to use the included A/C power adapter if you plug a USB hub (like I did) or 2 high drain devices into this card.

This memory card is smaller than a stamp and thinner than a penny and holds 4,000,000,000 bytes (or 4,000 megabytes)of info! Pretty amazing for something so small. At a hundred and twenty bucks its a great value. Can hold lots of videos/movies/music. Wonder what 2020 will be like with memory cards"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Logitech Z-2300,Great range of sound with a thumping sub-woofer. My Wife keeps telling me to turn the bass down.

electronics,34 of 34,2.0,"Poor display quality, and a wiring bug","Whatever happened to the good old days, when caller ID boxes featured readable displays?  I have a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old unit both of which are far easier to read than this one.  The digits contrast poorly with the background, and the display is covered with a cheap, shiny material which reflects light.  There are five adjustable contrast settings: bad, worse, awful, atrocious, and worst.  The polarity of the feed-through is reversed, which means that an older push-tone phone cannot be plugged in through the box (you can't dial out).  Newer phones, and rotary phones, should work OK.  When the caller is UNKNOWN (unavailable, out-of-area) the words UNKNOWN NUMBER blink, but very slowly, in an annoying way that forces you to wait a second to see what's going on.  This box, in common with most others, cannot be used with a 2-line phone plugged into it (not even the phone will work, let alone the caller ID) because the manufacturer was too cheap to include two extra wires in the feed-through.  Another feature missing from this and other boxes is a way to delete all calls from a specific number simultaneously (this would be especially handy with UNKNOWN calls).  Not a great product, GE, but you're not alone, I guess"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome!,"First of all, these blow away the standard earbuds that came with my Sandisk Sansa.  Instead of struggling to ear the words of my audio book on volume 9 (on a noisy train), I can clearly hear at volume 2 or 3."

electronics,4 of 14,2.0,Very Unflat Frequency Response  Headphones,It's unbelievable that a company with a great reputation like Sennheiser would release a product as flawed as this one.   The lower bass is artificially boosted and the upper freqs are rolled off.  If you are a true audiophile and truly know what a great headphone should sound like then stay away from the HD 650s
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Pain Problem Solved,"I was very skeptical about purchasing these headphones, because the IPod earphones, and several sony earbuds hurt my ears after an extended period of time. These were much better than i thought. The  sound is clear, and a great sound for around 15 dollars.The cord slider is always a nice feature. And about them falling off, so far, i have not had any problem with them. They are very light, and very comfortable. You don't need to shove them in your ear liek the earbuds, and the weight is distributed to different parts of your ear, allowing you to wear them for extended periods of time, w/o them hurting.  I would ahve given it 5 stars, but the material used, could have been a little more flexible, which might cause the problem of falling off people are saying they are having. "

electronics,,5.0,Excellent option to avoid camera cables,"I bought recently a Sony W50 camera, and it uses a Memory Stick Pro Duo card, and I wasn't able to find any card reader that support this type of card, but with this adaptor I can use any card reader that works with normal old fashion memory stick media types and I could avoid using my camera and all the cables to download my picture"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Not compatible with 5400/5500 iPaqs,Wish there had been some mention of this before I got it.  The antenna on the 5400 and 5500 series of iPaqs makes it physically impossible to plug this in using a standard CF sleeve.  Supposedly it can work if you use a dual CF sleeve
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,A large white plastic donut,"Recently, these speakers became stuck in the loudest volume and I was unable to turn the volume down. The JBL Web site said there is a defective chip in some of the speakers and that JBL would replace the chip. Unfortunately they claim mine was not one of the ones eligible for recall, although the sympotoms are identical as described on their Web site."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,amazing screen,"One attribute not fully appreciated about this PDA is the screen. It is 640x480, as opposed to older models, such as the Dell Axim X30 (which I also own), which is 240x320. This makes a huge difference, not only for displaying photos, but also for surfing the web and writing notes. My X30 would crash when displaying the front page of the New York Times. Not so for the X51v (perhaps that is a difference between Windows Mobile 4 and 5). Writing notes free-hand was a bit crude on the X30. Not so for the X51v. Most of all, Photos are impressively richer and more detailed. Before my pictures were serviceable; now my photos look gorgeous, a feast for the eyes. "
electronics,0 of 4,4.0,Much better than average headphones,"I would rate them with 5 stars , but the cord is about 2 foot to short and I had to buy an extender in order to use the headphones as I intended to when I purchased them"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,4gb mem stick great purchase,"Great product, tons of space. so far got 1 movie and tons of music on my memory stick and still got lots more space to use up. Play back from it is perfect. Have always liked sandisk products and i will continue to purchase them"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,"So simple, it doesn't need instructions...","If you need instructions, you can use the following: Insert one end of the cables into Device A. Insert the other end of the cables in Device B. Congratulations, you are done."
electronics,7 of 8,1.0,no show !!!,I paid good money for the replacement plan which should have been delivered around 26-29 June.  It is now July 19th & I still have not received it !!!
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,I don't know what has happened to HP,"I got this calculator about a year ago. There was some locking up problems and sometimes it would not turn on. I updated all the ROMs like HP instructed. Finally, I got a replacement from HP. But it turns out it was some old refurbished one that the enter key smashed in after I used it for 10 minutes. I had to pay to send this one back and now, they sent me another old used replacement. Most of the gold paint has flaked off the front of this one and also around the side trim. It started missing keystrokes with the latest ROM, so I had to go find an old ROM from last year on the Internet. The keyboard is piss poor and makes a ""thunk"" noise, annoying when I am taking a test and to the people around me. Also, the right shift key started feeling loose today."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,A great buy  those with dvd players with out component,"MVSV3 Gives excellent color with a vivirant and vivid feel.     Deffinently a high porformence wire in its class,and worth the buy"
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,"Not bad, but next time I'll buy an HP","I have had the printer for about a year now, and have no complaints about ease of use or print quality. I have, however, experienced a number of paper jams, and today ran into another 'feature' of Brother HL-2040: it comes with a reduced-capacity 'starter' cartridge. Surprisingly, the printer stopped working (with 'Toner' light on) when the print quality was still perfectly fine. If I were buying a printer now, I'd opt for a more reliable, and smaller, HP 1018. (Does HP pinch pennies from buyers' pockets on 'lite' cartridges too?)"
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,Not worth it,"I've had this for 4 weeks now and haven't yet figured out how to program it.  I did manage to download songs but it won't play them became because of a ""file error"".  I'm pretty computer literate but this thing has me stumped."
electronics,4 of 9,5.0,Very nice,I found this product to be very beneficiary in the overall quality of sound and picture.  I t improved it by a good 40%.  Its a safe and beneficial purchase
electronics,53 of 54,5.0,"So great! Small, light and completely useful...","(Review refers to the red version of this product). This thing is so great! With only 90 seconds of cranking the handle, you get up to an hour's charge... the flashlight part is not big, so it won't light a large area, but it's perfect as an emergency device. Radio works perfectly and there is even an earphone jack should you need to use the radio without disturbing others. This may sound geeky, but it's a perfect thing to give every family member to keep in their rooms in case of emergency. For the price, it's a really smart thing to get BEFORE you need it. If you are in a hurricane or tornado-prone area, you should really get one for your home. The red color actually has a little bit of a metallic sheen to it, so this thing is not only very practical, it looks cool, too. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,how NOT to get lost,"I certainly won't say I don't know how I lived without this unit, and I can see how this little basic GPS has limitations depending on your lifestyle and expectations.  But is EXACTLY what I needed.  There is no way I use it up to its full potential, but knew that would be the case.  Just wanted something to help me with knowing how many miles I""m covering on my daily hikes, changes in altitude (difficulty of hikes), keeping track of my route and time, etc.  Every once in awhile my dog and I bushwack, and with this I can always find my way out of a tangle of underbrush, or back towards home should we lose sight of our obvious landmarks.  Where we live is an area where people do geo-cache and I've thought about doing some of that while I'm out there, but haven't gotten beyond the thought yet.  One day we'll venture beyond our immediate home area  where the landmark's are strange and unknown and then this unit will really prove itself.  Oh, and as to the matter of batteries - I use this unit about 90 minutes every other day and the first set of regular alkaline batteries lasted about 6 weeks.  The unit kept saying the batteries were okay, but when it took a noticeably longer time to boot up and easily lost signal when under only slight cover, I knew it was time to replace them.  So just keep aware about battery strength so you don't find yourself in strange territory without power"
electronics,,5.0,As expected,It comes in the retail packaging and a little clear plastic case which holds both the card and the regular SD adapter. I got it for my LG CU500 phone and so far no problems at all
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Wireless in Minutes,"Setup was easy.  I followed the instructions contained in the manual, and within 10 minutes I was WIRELESS.  I have absolutely no regrets and am satisfied with his purchase. A good product from D-Link"
electronics,,5.0,Terrific,"I love it. You get what you pay for and this is worth every penny. Good microphone, good in low light, good echo control. If your thinking about it, Get it - skip the cheaper models (which I have made the mistake of buying and returned) "
electronics,,5.0,Absolutely no problems.,Works like a charm. Easy to program. It's inexpensive but does what it's supposed to do.
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,Garmin GPS 10,"I tried about 8 different GPS units.  All varying in size, purpose, etc and decided on this unit.  I finally decided on the GPS10.  It connected easily to my BlueTooth enabled PDA.  The software is perfect.  The GPS travels with me easily across the country . . . it even helped me find the Rainbow Bridge at Lake Powell.  If you already have a PDA, this unit is perfect, compact, and reliable"
electronics,15 of 15,5.0,great bargain,"Okay, since most of the printers don't come with cables any longer, you always need to purchase one separately.  A &quot;regular&quot; printer cable can cost around $20 and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs.  So a USB cable is a great solution.  It costs less and it's easy to plug and unplug, especially if your computer has front-mounted USB ports.  I bought this one for my new HP LaserJet 1012 Printer and it works just fine.  For this price, it's a great bargain"
electronics,,5.0,Cost Specialist,We really loved the item.  The size of the Flash drive is perfect!  We have a tight spot to insert the driver and this item fits perfect
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Hawaii Photo Fool,"I was going on vacation for 2 weeks and wanted a bigger card for my camera.  I shopped around and found the best price on Amazon, as well as shipping time was good."
electronics,,5.0,THE BEST FOR YOUR BUCK!,"This headset is far superior to any other headset in its price range. I am hard and rough with it and it never breaks. I have spilled coffee, cola, water, and food on it and it still works fine. I get mad and throw it, no problem, still works. ITS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!"
electronics,1 of 6,2.0,Software Is Horrible,"This is a great thumb drive, but with a built in disaster.  The U3 software might seem handy.  But if you use it it soon reveals that it is crippleware.  You have to pay $25 to get a 'rull function' version.  THEN, if you decide to remove it, it keeps reinstalling itself, just like a virus.  I would AVOID this product at all costs."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent product   simple and easy,Its simple...the firewire cable is easy to install...click it in and it goes to work...no problem.....Thanks  
electronics,,5.0,icf-m410v,"I bought it for travel but it has replaced my regular clock radio. Why: no cord, no bright LED lights to dim down, I can work it perfectly in the dark, all digital, and takes no space on the nightstand. Perfect"
electronics,5 of 8,4.0,great card- great price," Lots of room.. I don't have to worry about running out of pictures- even in RAW format. And a Ton of pcitures in hi-res JPEG format. Plus, it was very affordable.  I have no complaints. I shoot with a Canon digital Rebel. I'm very happy with this purchase"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,APC 350ES - Very poor UPS,"I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Hub,"This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Excellent Bluetooth Headset,"Comfortable, high sound quality, excellent range of volume, as loud or as quiet as you want.  Decent wind noise suppression. Excellent outbound sound and volume.  One of the best headsets I have ever used with a phone AND it happens to be bluetooth. "
electronics,2 of 4,2.0,"Great MP3, When it Works","I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat.  This is a quibble, however, that one can live with.  Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Nice player in this price range,I have played a few DVD's in this player and it is as a quality image on my Sony HDTV.  I purchased this machine as a comparison for my older high-end player and as a backup device.  A comparison between the two yielded excellent picture quality on par with my more expensive player.  I wanted a SACD player and one with HDMI connector to go to my TV.  Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase
electronics,5 of 8,5.0,HP 94 C8765W Black Inkjet Print Cartridge,Too expensive to ship.  Frt.should be free
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,HP Rocks,"Everyone that have used old HP calculators knows the value of RPN. But newbies to the calculating world hates RPN, namely my son.  This HP lets you set up anyway your calculator the way you want it. The learning curve is a bit much (for a calculator) but once you get the hang of it, it rocks.  It also looks like a serious piece of equipment and not just a calculator"
electronics,8 of 29,2.0,Read before you buy!,This unit is outstanding if you don't mind spending $300 every quarter on new bulbs.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Simply a fantastic Cat 5 Cable,"This network cable feels durable and is 10 ft long so it helps to reach thouse network accessories. The cable is ruged and the covers for the tabs help protect the connection. Bought 2, will by again if more are needed"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Finally!,An obvious design to solve a problem that everyone has.  The quality is great and the length is perfect; just enough to move the item away from the plug but not too much to cause clutter.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,unexpected performance,carry with me everywhere...thought i lost it then found it in a pair of  shorts that was put through the wash and dry. plugged it in after a short prayer- pulses with that blue light with no loss of data.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Phones with a Receiver or Amp,I bought these phones last week for use in my home stereo system. I own the Bose Triports for use with my IPOD.
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,Fine TDK DVDs,"These TDK DVD+R will _only_ burn at the designated speed, 16x, they are no good at any other speeds."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,This was not an Apple branded product,"I ordered this throuugh the Amazon Marketplace from lusopc, but they did not send the Apple cable pictured. Instead it was an ugly knock-off cable by a generic manufacturer. Caveat emptor"
electronics,,5.0,great product,I bought this as a gift and the person loved it.  Great deal for the money
electronics,7 of 10,1.0,Double check your items.,"It was offered as an accessory to the Panasonic phone that I had purchased, but on receiving the items the phone and the headset were not compatible."
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Not worth the headache,"I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player)."
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,How many pictures will it store?,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Why would you buy this?,"When wireless headsets go for not much more, why would you get this? Let me tell you why.....wireless headsets pick up every bit of wind, so the person on the other end thinks you are going over the rainbow with your dog.....I was not sure about this, but bought it because of the reviews (and because I have a set for audio....which are truly amazing). It was worth it. I can keep it on my left side with my car window wide open driving 75 and there are no complaints of wind noise. The clarity is superb. There are a few things you should know."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,The Best Photo Paper I've Used,"I own a Canon i860 photo printer and love it!  I've tried several different types of paper and this Canon Photo Paper Plus (I use the glossy finish) produces the best results I've ever gotten. It is impossible for me to tell the difference between the ones I print at home and lab-produced prints. I think it is certainly worth the price Amazon is currently charging. This paper beats out Kodak Picture Paper for quality, as well as the HP papers I've tried,even better than Jet Print Professional papers I've used. Of course, I love the Canon printer too, so it's a great combination. I think you'll be pleased with this paper, especially if you have a photo printer"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,This device is amazing when you learn to work it. ,This device is the first of its kind and it works very well once you learn how to use it. I use it on both my ipod 5g and ipod 5.5g. The playlist option is the best feature so learn how to make good playlists people. The AAA battery in the remote will last for a week of heavy use. I only use recharable batteries so it's no problem for a 21st century man like myself.
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,"Logitech's Desktop, Cheap But Still Quality",I was pretty much looking for any inexpensive wireless mouse and keyboard. I saw this to be one of the most inexpensive (I won't say cheap) ones avaliable.
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Pretty good,"This is a great product.  It works really well most of the time, except in the mornings.  I live in Minesota, so after it has sat in the cold all night, it skips alot.  Other than that I have had no problems.  The iPlug is a great feature, although it can be tricky to run the wire through your dash.  If you know how your dash comes apart, this is a great feature"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Magnificent!!!,Must say that the item was better than I expected. Thanks to the seller and will buy again!!!
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,"Compact, clear sound, good design","Good:  Lightweight, compact, good design, clear sound, plastic ear buds"
electronics,6 of 12,5.0,Pleasantly Surprised,"I added the Monster THX Speaker wire, along with THX connectors, out of curiosity to see if there would be any difference, at all, in sound quality. Much to my surprise there was a very noticable improvement in clarity and crispness on the highs when compared to the standard speaker wire I was using. I'm using an Onkyo TX-DS595 Receiver and Infinity HTS-20 speakers. This was an easy inexpensive and worthwhile improvement to my home theater"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very effective and user friendly.,"I puchased this product with some hesitation as I am not known as a computer guru; however, I can honestly attest to the simplicity and effectiveness of this bluetooth adapter.  I have a Sony vaio laptop operating with windows XP pro; the directions were simple to follow and the product has worked flawlessly, and surpassed my expectations in use and range.  I would certainly recommend this product or purchase it again for myself"
electronics,,5.0,Logitech Cordless Desktop EX110 ( 967561-0403 ),"This item has performed excellently, I recommend it to anyone looking to avoid the entanglement of a wired mouse. This is freedom"
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Nah,You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,"Well priced, high end panel","I have owned this for half a year now. This monitor is based on the same Samsung S-PVA panel that you can find in Eizo CE210 monitors at 3x the price. After I calibrated the monitor with the Optix XR, the screen test turned out to be exceptionally good, matching the CE210 visually (I borrowed one for comparison).  It also has individual RGB control, making calibration a breeze.  I am a working photographer, I run a fully calibrated workflow and accuracy is extremely important to me.  So far, I have not seen a print out of a prolab with custom profile that does not closely match what I see on this screen.  Banding is minimal and the color rendition is fantastic.  Based on the calibration, the screen (white point) maybe a tad on the bright side, but it is still well within the calibration limits."
electronics,,4.0,"Velocity Nylon 600 CD Wallett (224 Capacity,Black)",Well constructed.  Heavy outter case material.  Sleeves are also well made and you don't have to punch out the plastic to get the DVD in!  We have bought others that are really cheeply made. Buy a name brand
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,A nice little college backpack.,"This is my fourth Targus item, I've purchased over the past five years. "
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent Reception and Doesn't Interfere with Computer,I have owned Panasonic phones for years and been happy with the quality. I wanted to upgrade to the 5.8 Ghz and have a phone with multiple headsets.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent mouse!,"This is a great mouse. I work in a web production environment, where I use the mouse all day, every day. It is essential for me to have the programmable buttons. The only thing that wasn't totally obvious when getting the mouse set up was how to program some of the key combinations. The instructions could be a little more detailed. But the performance and functionality of the mouse is superb! I am very happy with it."
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Excellent!,"It pays to buy direct from Amazon!  Came as stated, in brand new condition.  a"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Best value you can get.,"I was an early adopter of this TV.  I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27"" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.     "
electronics,,5.0,Best Remote Ever!,"This remote is absolutely amazing! Set up is easy and fast. I was a little worried it would control my home theater system, because it is one of the all in one systems. Nope. It found it and controls it perfectly. My wife loves this remote because all she has to do is push one button to do what she wants. No more going through a series of remotes to do what you want. I was even able to customize the settings to get the remote to suit my taste. I can't think of anything bad. If you have a complicated media center in your home, get this remote now"
electronics,13 of 14,4.0,Great sound quality and features,"No interference at all with my wireless router, which was my greatest concern. Moreover, the sound quality is great! "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,works brilliantly!,"I got one of these in germany and i find it works great! it has spent two days and nights on my gravel drive in pouring rain and it survived and still works to perfection! a must have for any ipod user (i use mine on the new 30gb video), not just the nano. get it now"
electronics,,5.0,Great Backpack!,"This backpack is great for taking your computer on trips.  I used it for my hp widescreen and still had room for books, clothes and toiletries on my trip"
electronics,,2.0,Hardware problem - massive number of interrupts,"I bought this card bundled with the matching router. The router works just fine but I when I tried to use the card in an XP portable (UK Evesham) it produced a massive slowdown in the PCs performance. The CPU utilization went to 100% whenever I plugged the card in. Using SysInternals process monitor showed that 50% of the CPU was being chewed up by Hardware Interrupts, and the rest by deferred procedure calls. So something was very wrong. "
electronics,43 of 46,5.0,Good Buy,"I have, for the past ten or so years, been a professional writer with over fifty short stories published, and two novels. When I saw this typewriter on Amazon.Com, I was shocked to see such a wonderful model going for such a small price. Daisy Wheel typewriters provide a long life, durability, and good quality production. Not to mention that it came with free shipping. And on a ten pound item, you will pay more than you would like for shipping and handling. This has several features that save a lot of time, and a lot of repeating, frustrating motions. The only thing better than the great deal our friends at amazon have given us is this: With a high Yeild Nylon Ribbon, it flows like a stretch of silk. I am currently half way through my next book, coming to about four-hundred pages as of now, and I am still on the same ribbon I started with. One High-Yeild ribbon is good for about 80,000 characters. If you are a student, this is a nice buy, and cheaper than buying a computer and a printer. If you are a writer like me, then you might hit it big on this one. In closing, you should grab these up, because the free shipping won't last forever, and I know all of my friends will want one. So, here's to you, Amazon, for this great model at an affordable price"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Elegant in its simplicity,"This charger is great, it has a single plug cord (identical to the one used with the power supply that comes with the Zaurus) and a small charging block that the battery snaps into. An LED indicates charging status (on its charging, off its done). It couldn't be simpler. My only complaint is that sharp uses a battery that can be inserted upside-down, this isn't the fault of the charger, you can do the same thing in your handheld"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Basic, light weight, portable speakers","I bought mine for travel purposes and use the JBL On Stage more when I am at home. The JBL does sound better but I got a decent price on the Altec, it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option. So I took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night. Thats 4 AA per night. Not exactly cheap. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good addition to laptop bag,This is a very usefull product.  Performs well and stores easily.  Makes a great addition to my laptop bag..
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,"It just works, but don't use with Panasonic HDAVI","Cable works just fine without the ""Monstrous"" price tag.  I think 6ft. is about as short as you want to go to be able to reach the video source. "
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Frequent volume control and other usage,This device is very useful to increase / decrease volume in these situation:
electronics,30 of 32,5.0,DVD Player works great for me.,"I purchased this particular model after reading countless reviews. I was mainly interested in a unit that could play all the different formats available, especially DVD's that I was taping from television and then duplicating using my computer DVD-R drive."
electronics,,5.0,Cruzer Micro Evaluation,I have an MP3 player that only uses the Cruzer Micro.  I had puchased several with greater capacity.  However I needed 2 smaller units for some special music.  This served my needs.
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,"Had it a year, works well",A very easy way to back up and to expand storage capacity.  So easy that I might never again replace a hard drive that has grown too small.
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Turtle Beach Riviera Sound Card,"After a weekend of frustration trying to use the built in sound on my new ...,.@#@^$%& mobo i finally broke down and purchased this Turtle Beach product. My experiences with other sound card"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Impecible Clarity - Instantaneously,"This is not my first signal booster but, it is  the first signal booster to have ever really worked.  "
electronics,3 of 8,5.0,Best looking nano,"The nano is awesome! Incredibly light, compact, and yet durable. The blue one is by far the best looking of them all. It locked up a little more than I would have liked, but it's easy to reboot."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Home photo printing made easy,"I have been very pleased with the ease of set up and ability to print with little beyond basic computer knowledge. Additionally, I look forward to learning more about the editing abilities and other manual options as I have time to explore. For now, I can print my digital snapshots immediately at home, which I use to take to the one hour shops, and retain excellent quality. This is a great investment for the serious photographer as well as the novice"
electronics,4 of 6,4.0,hp 3845 color inkjet printer does the job,The printer does a good job with basic printing.  I haven't tried any photo printing with it yet.  Easy to install & use
electronics,19 of 20,5.0,Excellent product,"I researched several high end portable DVD players and selected this one because of the larger screen, ability to swing the screen over the DVD player for easier viewing and longer battery life.  I have been very pleased with all of these features (althought the battery does not last the indicated 6 hours).  I have used it for one month and find it lives up to the product description and excellent reviews it had received.  For the money it was a great choice"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,This phone works great!!!,"I'm using it with my VoiP service line and I have no problems whatsoever with it, like I've read from others reviews"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,GREAT but pray you don't have to deal with the warranty,"I've been buying thumb drives for a staff of engineers for the past 3 years.  Out of the dozens of USB drives that I've purchased, Sandisk drives have always worked on a variety of different hardware platforms without a problem.  With one exception - one drive died shortly after first use.  It was covered by Sandisk warranty but dealing with their repair/support/RMA system was a nightmare. It took 5 e-mail exchanges through their automated system requiring useless (and repeated) diagnostics & unnecessary ""hoops"" before they believed me that the drive was dead.  Without a doubt, it cost more in my time to replace the drive then the drive itself was worth.  I'm betting Sandisk relies on this so that people just toss the bad drives and go out and buy a new one"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,sleek & sexy with lots of inputs,"With no trouble at all, this expansion dock was up and running. On my system, it currently maintains a network connection, parallel printer, usb camera doc & photo printer, external keyboard, mouse, and amplified speakers, to the docked laptop. A single usb 2.0 connects the dock to the laptop. The dock is height adjustable and cradles the laptop very comfortably. It looks great, functions great, and if it withstands the test of time I will give it a five out of five stars. "
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Great give idea for iPod owning Music Lover,"I received several of these for Christmas and for other occasions in the past. It's been a nice change versus getting a whole CD, especially since my music taste is all over the place. Although there are the artists that I enjoy the whole CD there still a fair amount where I really only care for a song or two, this helps feed that demon."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Power Punch,Don't have an Ipod so I found searching for portable speakers tough. Used to have Altec Lansing IM4. Sound was too weak. Searched for alternatives. Found Creative Labs Travel 200 and the JBL OnTour Speakers. The OnTour sound is significantly louder than the Altec Lansing IM4 but not as loud as the Travel 200. Sound is also a quality sound not just all treble.
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"good sound, but REINFORCEMENT IS REQUIRED to prevent breaking",I have both grey and black version now
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great price and great quality!,"I rarely write a review , but I figure I should on this one. First off, the price was perfect for 100 dvd blanks. Next, the quality of the blanks for burning backups of dvds I have, worked fantastic... although finding the right software to do the deed is tricky at first. Anyhow, I also had to clean house on a 30 gig drive and a laptop so the file transfer worked fine to the dvd's. My only problem was with the shipment itself. It came in some square box...I opened the box to find some paperbags wrapped around a broken dvd container with the blanks barely hanging on. The plastic that incased them was totally shreded and broken. Go figure! They need to work on their shipping skills. Try bubble wrap next time boys and not paper sacks. Other than that, I just needed to burn backups of dvds and get files to dvds so the item itself worked pro. I highly recommend. I don't blame Verbatim for the shipping issues... Go for it"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Short life span,"I do not recommend Apple's Ipod and IF you are going to buy one, get the extended warranty. Over the past 3.5 years, I have owned three Ipods and all three died with the same problem after about a year....the well known folder with the exclamation mark.  At first it is fixable by restoring or resetting the device, but then the hard dive siezes up and you have a paper weight.  I have done this three times because I own all the accessories including by beloved Bose docking station.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Buy,"Great speakers.  I've read that the bass speaker is too boomy, but that hasn't been the case for me.  I mainly use them for listening to music on my computer, so I adjusted the bass using the equalizer on windows media player, and they sound terrific. "
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Not worth the price.  Can get better headphones for a fifth of this price,"Just because its a BOSE you tend to think that they sound better.  Indeed if you go to a BestBuy store, where there is lot of ambient noise and try these haedphones you perceive it to sound better.  But return home and then compare them with other cheaper headphones and you will find that the BOSE is not tremendous after all."
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,Excellent ad-on for ipod shuffle!,"The arm band is and essential add-on for ipod shuffle, for those who use it for running.  It avoids your ipod to be in contact with sweat"
electronics,0 of 3,5.0,Great site!,I am very pleased with my purchase. The product was of a great quality and the delivery time was good.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Best of What's Available in THis Catagory,"I tried the Griffin Road Trip first; it looked good , held the iPod nicely, but it didn't work well at all.  Not nearly enough signal out.  In fact it was so weak that it was not usable.  Following the advice I found in reviews I saw here on the Amazon site, I tried the Kensington 33185 Digital FM Transmitter/Auto Charger.  IT IS EXCELLENT."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"As sturdy as it looks, and with very good sound for the price","I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it ""should,"" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort."
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,NO VOLUME AT ALL,"This DVD player has a great screen, but that is all! When you are watching a movie you want sound also, and the volume in this DVD player is completely useless. Incredible, how a brand as Philips can deliver this kind of lame quality"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,A Great Cordless Phone System,"This is the best phone I have ever had!  The best part of this 5.4 GHz phone, other than the quality of voice without interruption through 2.4 GHz LAN network or microwave, is that it can mute ringer sound but you know you are recieving call by flushing light from the antenna.  This is great if you have babies(no more awake by annoying ringer sound while they are taking a nap).  All the necessary functions are included (answering machine, caller ID, storing telephone numbers, and etc.  I highly recommend this phone"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic deal!,"I don't know what people are complaining about, I've never had ANY problems with the mouse or keyboard."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,iPod Armband,I have used this item frequently on solo marathon training runs.  Works fantastic. A better buy than the Apple brand armband by far
electronics,,2.0,Depends on what you're looking for,"I bought this to try to get some stronger signal to my Xbox 360 by setting it to connect to the ""a"" side and then my laptop to the ""g"" side.  This worked great and I didn't have the same problems as others with the WEP security.  I set that up with no problem."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Hub,"This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says"
electronics,17 of 25,2.0,Doesn't work well with Audible,I bought this as an IPOD alternative for Audible books .  It takes a long time to start and stop and does not return to where you left off in a book accurately.  Maddening.  I'd avoid this if you listen to audiobooks
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Not as bad as others say...,I was clicking onto this item with the intent to buy another (I already own one) when I saw people's often bad reviews of it and decided I'd leave my two cents so that prospective buyers can have a varied set of opinions.
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Pleased despite installation glitches,"I received this adaptor in less than a week.  It was packaged as seen (blister wrap).  You have to be careful when opening the package as the mini CD is right behind the paper .  I ended up installing from the software on my Dell Inspiron 1505 laptop as instructed but kept getting a windows error indicating there was a ""problem with installation"" and the ""hardware may not work properly"".   With that, the windows ""found new hardware"" window appeared.  I went through the windows process of installing from the CD (as well) with the IR adapter plugged into the computer and the adapter now works great.  I do have to plug the adapter into the same USB port on my computer that I did the set-up on.  Overall I am pleased with the product despite the installation glitches"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,NOT FOR TEXTBOOKS,"I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks.  If you put a textbook on it and turn the page, it collapses and or tears the page.  I wouldn't even use this for a notebook.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Superb purchase,"This are already great discs, I haven't lost one by disc's cause (a couple, because a computer power issue)."

electronics,0 of 2,5.0,will this work with my xbox?,will this hub work with my xbox with a 50' cable if not what should i buy
electronics,,4.0,As good as it gets for under $20.,"The biggest pro of these speakers is the price. If you're on a tight budget, like I was when I bought them, you probably won't find a better deal. I found them at Walmart for about $15. The biggest downside is the volume control. If you turn them very low, you get a very poor quality sound. Turn them up to about midlevel and it sounds less artificial. You can't turn them up very loud because they quickly reach the distortion point, but they give an ok sound as long as you find the balance. Now, in the level that they work at, they do give a good contrast between high and low dynamics, so just fiddle with them for a while, find that balance, then leave the volume alone and rely on your computer or CD player's volume control."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good product when properly configured,I got this adapter to allow a recorder (KISS DP 558)to connect wirelessly to my WIFI network and hence avoid running cable all around the house.

electronics,55 of 56,4.0,Handsome Compact Alarm with a Few Flaws.,"I perused countless mail order catalogs and searched dozens of stores looking for a small alarm clock that would be suitable for travel and unobtrusive on a night stand, but found only clocks that were either too large or too chintzy. So I was elated to find Sharper Image's Dual-Time Travel Alarm Clock (SR362). The time is displayed in large numbers (7/8 inch tall), with the date and a second time of your choosing displayed underneath. You can choose 12-hour or 24-hour ""military"" time. In the 12-hour mode, the display says ""PM"" when appropriate, but does not ever say ""AM"". The display lights up with a bright blue light when the large snooze/light button is depressed. The snooze/light button is a generous 2 1/4  x 1 1/2 inches in size, so you won't have to fumble for it in the dark. "
electronics,,1.0,Not so Good.  Latency is another problem,"Besides the drawbacks mentioned in other reviews, it also has quite a bit of latency.  If just listening to music, it wouldn't matter.  I wanted to use it  with my guitar, plugging it into the processing unit.  The problem is that there is a second or two delay between playing a note and hearing it in this wireless headphone.  Also, the charging lights didn't work at all. "
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Just what I needed. ,"I needed a hard case, with a strap that would go around my neck.  You can't find anything like this in the stores.  Most of them are just a soft case, maybe with a wrist strap.  This was ideal"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Flaky,"Overall I like Netgear...but I think this card may have been rushed to market.  It worked fine at first, but overtime developed issues to the point where, the card will not establish a connection with the Gigabit Switch.  I have some 100 MB switch ports still available, and the card works ok in them, but when I connect it to the Gigabit Switch, it will not establish a connection.  We have upgraded drivers, reseated the cards, tried different ports, even rebuilt the computer and it still will not maintain a connection unless we have it connected to the 100 MB switch...which kind of defeats the purpose.  Hopefully Netgear's newer Gigabit cards are more stable"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Sangean Pocket FM Radio,"Like many reviews here, I am extremely pleased with this radio in particular its FM reception. I haven't yet mastered the station pre-sets so I would say that feature is not user friendly. Some reviews I read when I purchased (now strangely deleted) recommended Sennheiser MX-500 In-Ear Headphones because the Sangean buds were poor quality. I followed this advice but really could not tell the difference.  However, my iPod earphones give the best sound fidelity."
electronics,,5.0,I will buy more of these.,"My brother got these for me a few years ago, and I think they're perfect."

electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"Does what it claims, and does it well.","This is an excellent photo printer for your 4x6 needs.  The only thing that would make it better would be an LCD display of your pictures, but if you realy want that feature, you can always spend some extra dough and get the Deluxe model which offers the LCD."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Unlike other USB Hubs,"This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices"
electronics,10 of 17,5.0,Super,"I love this iPod, it looks beautiful and elegant, perfect for its purpose, reasonable price, easy to use"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Best paper for me,"I've tried several different kinds of photo paper, and this has consistently been the best for me.  CompUSA brand paper yellows within a couple weeks.  Kodak paper does not absorb the ink well, making the prints stick to the album pages.  There's another brand which I forget the name of that was alright, but had some yellowing.  This Epson paper absorbs ink well and does not stick to the album.  Top marks"
electronics,5 of 7,1.0, 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors. ,They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up).
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Excellent Printer,"I was looking for a average printer and got much more then that.  This does it all.  I love the smart card drives.  It makes importing pictures a snap.  I would rate it a 8 out of 10.  Not a 10 because it doesn't come with it's own USB cable.  You have to buy that.  I called HP and complained.  They should be suppling that item.  Anyhow, other then that..excellent printer, fax, scanner. "
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,DO NOT BUY,"I've owned my wireless mouse for almost a year now and can't tell you how many times I've had to change batteries.  I've already changed them 3 times in December.  The mouse uses AAA batteries, so I always have to make a trip to the store.  Not to mention, you have to pry the old batteries out with a knife or some sharp device.  Today I finally had enough;  I threw the mouse into the wall, shattering it into pieces.  I will be sure to buy a new one that has a charger"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome!!,"I got my MicroPhoto in last week and when I started falling in love with it, i realized that I would most likely drop it by accident and mess it up, with my luck.  So I started searching for cases for it and came across this one.  It seemed good and at the price you can't go wrong.  I got it today and must say I am quite pleased!  It fits it like a glove and doesn't osbtruct anything on the player, but it will prevent it from easily fitting in small pockets like it used to.  But now it feels sturdy and won't be hurt if you drop it!  And not only that, but it comes with a sturdy belt clip as well, which is another plus.  So in summation, if you have a MicroPhoto, GET THIS CASE!!  You'll be glad you did"
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Worst Headphones ever!!!,"I got these headphones because of the reviewsm saying how great they were. Well, who ever thinks these headphones are great must out of their minds (no offense). These headphones have horrible sound quality, can hardly hear anything, they always fall out of my ears, even after i found the right earpiece. The slightest tug on the cord and they fall out. Also the behind the head cord thing is really a bugger. In my opinion these headphones are the worst [...] headphones i have ever purchased"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Exceptionally Clear Wireless Joy,"I've had these headphones for about 2 weeks now and they've completely surpassed my expectations and I'm extremely happy with them. They work flawlessly with every device I've hooked them to. They can connect to anything with a strereo headphone jack (3.5mm) and If you'd like to hook them up to your Audio/Video reciever all you need is one of those jacks that converted the large plug to the small ones. They're foolproof to use; simply conect the very small bluetooth transmitter to a device and turn it on, turn on the headphones and they hook up seamlessly. The audio quality is much better than I expected and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between wired and wireless because the sound is exceptional. The charger provided charges both the headphones and the small transmitter at the same time, the charge time is only about 2.5 hours and they last a reasonable 7-8 hours of continous music play. What makes these headphones so versatile is that they can also be used in wired mode and they come with a cable that alows you to use tham as regular wired headphones if the battery dies out on you. They are quite lightweight and I use them at the gym regularily. The ONLY slight downside is that because the headphones have a built in Lithium-Ion battery, they are a little larger than I'd like but it's a downside I am more then willing to put up with because having NO wires is simply amazing. I don't think I can ever go back to wired headphones. I can't believe more people don't own these yet because CREATIVE obviously did their research before releasing these and overall they are exceptional headphones. There is occasionally interference but the transmitter automatically fixes it quickly so al you need to do is hook them up to your MP3 and leave it in your pocket. Even more good news is that if you have a MP3 player that supports the audio controls, you can scroll through songs from buttons on the headphones, but even if your MP3 player doesn't support this, there is a volume control on the headphone that works no matter what the transmitter is hooked to. Just so you know, these headphones are not meant to transmit very far and there is interference if you go a room or too away because the transmiter is so small it really can't create a strong enough signal to punch through a bunch of walls but this isn't what the headphones are meant for. I simply can't say enough good things about these great sounding wireless headphones and I'd highly recomend them to anyone wanting a perfect solution for some wirelss music from an MP3 player, TV, and any other device you'd like to hook them. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great keyboard!,"I was just looking for a good illuminated keyboard when I bought this one.  Yep, it's illuminated but it's also a VERY good keyboard.  I like it better than the Dell keyboard that came with my PC.  If you're looking for a keyboard, illuminated or not, buy this one!"

electronics,,5.0,Pleased with Sony MDR-EX71SL Headphones,"I was pleased with the price, happy with the time of delivery, and so far have had no issues with the quality of these headphones.  The sound quality is good on airplanes, when working out, and they do not fall out of my ears nor do they cause any discomfort"
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Really solves a problem,"Lost cases, or copies. You can get spindles of CD/DVDrs, but how do you keep track after?"
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Wireless head set,"Would have been helpful to know that this doesnt work without the handset lifter. You push a button at your ear to access the phone line but unless the handset is off the hook, you dont get access. So your choices are to take it off the hook each time (which makes it not so wireless) or get the handset lifter as well that lifts the handset for you. Other than that i am very happy with the product. It has good reception, I can hear well and it has a nice range so you dont have to be on top of your phone for the handset lifter to lift the handset"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Lotsa bang for your buck!,"I am very pleased with the size and storage capacity of this bag.  It's very comfortable to carry slung over my shoulder and very spacious.  I wouldn't recommend it if you want a small carrying case for just your laptop but if you're a road warrior who relies on lots of accessories and gadgets, this is a heck of a deal."
electronics,6 of 10,4.0,Good product without instructions,"I purchased this product for my 3 yr old.  He loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise.  It did not come with instructions, so we're having to self teach ourselves the features.  Surprisingly, I can't get the vibration feature to work with his Nascar game and this is a Nascar race wheel.  The vibration works for his SpongeBob game??"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Wow!  This thing really works!,"I was ready to replace the CD player in my Honda Odyssey, much skipping and would not even play many of my CDs. Two quick cycles with this product (less than two minutes) and the player is as good as new"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,"Great Idea, time saver, but...","Pros: I gave this item a 4 out of 5 stars because like many of you have so many sites that require logins now a days and some are not atonomous enough to remember your login info or password. This thing really comes in handy when logging onto your bank account website or other frequently viewed websites. So far successful programs that have worked which are non Microsoft programs are, Yahoo Messenger 8.0 and Gmail Notifyer. Logging into Hotmail, other sites like amazon.com are a breeze. "
electronics,,4.0,Good overall.,"I didn't buy these speakers. I was traveling to my mother's friends house, and her daughter owned these. I wasn't sure if they were new or used, but overall they worked well. I listened to them while doing my hmework with my cheap off-brand mp3 player."
electronics,,5.0,iPod nano,It has been a long time since I was so pleased with such a marvelous toy.
electronics,,5.0,Took getting used to...now LOVIN' it,"When I first got the headphones, I was frustrated...they seemed quiet...not much bass...didn't sound that great."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best Ever,"This is the best product ever. I can walk two rooms away and still get perfect reception. The sound is amazing, it will feel like you just got new ears and have never heard real sound before. The only complaint I have is the headphones shut off after about 10 minutes or so, to save battery life. They do this when you are surfing your computer, but it takes ten seconds to shut of the sound, so it really isnt that big of a deal. Outstanding Product!!"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Works much better than LinkSys,A Linksys router I had was disconnecting streaming radio after 30 seconds and not letting me see my sent mail.  I went into dialup to do things that should have worked.  I had read and heard that Netgear was much better and it sure is!  Linksys has replaced my router and perhaps it will get used.  I don't know.  I am happy with the Netgear one

electronics,7 of 7,4.0,great clicky keyboard w/ a few flaws,"I'd agree with the others that the action on the keys make this keyboard. It really is nice to type with. I use my Powerbook for all my computer work (which has a great keyboard, very similar to the slimtype), and like to use an external keyboard/mouse when at home. The Pro Keyboard keys are just too sludgy and require too direct of a keypress (if you go at any sort of angle, it has resistance which can really work your fingers after a day's work)."
electronics,5 of 6,2.0,You get what you pay for.,"Great price for a portable usb mic pre.  But you definitely get what you pay for.  The audio quality is extremely poor, and it quite often crashed the system.  If you are doing simple recordings like podcasts or just getting scratch tracks for song ideas, this is the item for you.  Otherwise, save your pennies up for the Lexicon Omega, or the paragon of portable audio interface:  the Mbox 2"
electronics,,5.0,AT&T Wireless Handset,"This is an excellent product.  Has all functions of base unit and has a very small footprint, i.e., doesn't take up much room on my bedside table.  I especially like the lighted dial feature and easy to read menu options"
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Intermittent reception,"I have not been impressed with the reception of this radio.  As another reviewer stated, the antenna seems to be the wire of the earbuds.  For me, this causes radio stations to have a rythmic swish of loud static as the cord swings while I run.  I've tried putting the cord under my shirt, which stops the rhythm of the static, however, there is still a lot of static at times.  It seems to be related to which cardinal direction I am facing and how the radio is oriented on my shorts.  Last, the radio will sometimes just seem to lose a station... not matter how finely I turn the little dial, I simply can't get it to come in clearly.  And for me, reception indoors is simply awful.  All in all, it's highly annoying and I would gladly pay triple what this radio costs for one that could lock onto a station clearly"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Ipod Hi-Fi,"This is one awesome product.... the sound is amazing. We bought it to use to fill in while the musicians at our wedding reception were taking breaks, and the sound filled the room. This is my SECOND Hi-Fi however. The first one i had occassionally would not produce anything but a static sound, but I still give it 5 stars because of Apples phenomenal customer service. I took the unit to our local Apple Store and told them of the problem. The tecs there said it was the first unit that had come back to them, and had not heard of any similar problems... BUT... they replaced it on the spot. They looked up the serial number, and were able to view the date & location it was purchased at, and within 10 minutes we were in and out of the store with a new Hi-FI. I have not experienced any problems with this one, and as I said before.. we are thirlled with the sound quality it produces!!"
electronics,,5.0,Sony LCHMA Aluminum Memory Stick Media Case,A stylish solution to organizing and protecting brittle memory sticks which fits neatly right behind the camera with a thin divider in the Cybershot hipbag.   Wearable extended shooting.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Perfect,"This was my first attempt to crimp CAT5/6 ethernet for home networking.  I bought a spool of CAT5 and ends from Home Depot and bought this tool online.  I had absolutely no problem with this tool.  It worked perfectly every time.  I only needed it for a short time, but it seemed nice and sturdy.  "
electronics,,5.0,Digital Rocks,I just changed to all fiber optic cable for my audio connections. Monster has really created an outstanding product. Definately worth the investment
electronics,,4.0,Does it's job well,I like this product very much. Now I can't work without using this mouse. It works atleast upto 15Ft. I connect my laptop sometimes to TV and use this mouse as kind of remote for watching videos from laptop.
electronics,3 of 4,2.0,what a waste,"These have to be the worst speakers created. I expected a lot more from Sony, but I guess everyone is allowed to make a mistake.  The only thing these are good for is to watch a movie on your computer if your laptop speakers are not that loud for dialogue, other than that I use my laptop speakers to listen to music"
electronics,20 of 22,1.0,Overpriced Cables and a Joke of a Remote,I agree with the other negative reviews -- the remote is too limited. You can't see the menu on the TV and you don't have a spin wheel on the remote.  Thus you're stuck just going to the next song.  Looks like the Apple designers spent too much time on the package (which is VERY sleek).
electronics,,1.0,"Horrible card, bad signal","I rate this card 1-star. It has a weak signal. Where Netgear saw 6 networks this carrd saw zero. I had trouble making it see my two routers. Changing channels and searching for the right one helped at one time. But I tried it recently, and it just couldn't find my wireless router on any channels. (the laptop was very near the router) So I replaced it with netgear and all was fine. Was a cheap move on my part to buy this one in the first place. Not that cheaper always means worse, just in this case it did"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,are those bass notes I hear?,"This is a good cable; it is thick, so it's well insulated and well shelded. The gold plated connecters are good to have, because gold will not tarnish, so the connecters will always provide good contact."
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,iPod Savior - From Creative no less, I am not an audiophile;
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,WOW.,"As a college student, I'm on a bit of a limited budget, but still wanted some quality speakers.  After doing some comparison shopping, I decided to buy the JBL E30's.  It was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time.  "
electronics,6 of 11,4.0,"Great, but has a sluggish interface","I upgraded from the previous generation iPod (4g), and expected this new iPod to be better in every way...well it is better in every way but one.  The interface is comparatively very slow to respond to input.  When you try to navigate through your songs, there is always a slight delay.  And when you scroll through your music, it goes scroll scroll stop (for a quarter second)...scroll scroll stop."
electronics,0 of 11,1.0,Lexar Product,The Lexar 1GB MS Duo Pro is awesome.  The price was good and the order and shipment from Amazon was 5 star.
electronics,,5.0,OPPO 971 is a teriffic DVD player,This unit is truly a videophile piece of hardware. It upscales wonderfully and has no noticeable video noise or artifacts. Colors are vibrant and the picture is great overall. Aside for it's flimsy drawer and somewhat slow startup it is perfect in all other respects
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"""The Rest of the Story"" and Printer Praise","First, I want to tell you, as Paul Harvey would say, ""The Rest of the Story"" regarding Tammy Tenan's (Camano Island, WA USA) review of the HP PhotoSmart 7960 printer.  I work for HP and noticed her poor review of this printer while researching which HP printer to purchase for myself.  I called an internal HP resource and they contacted Tammy and replaced her printer at no charge.  Although there was no excuse for what happened, I hope she is now a satisfied HP customer.  I'll probably never know how this experience affected her view of HP."
electronics,,2.0,AVERAGE PICTURE--HORRIBLE SOFTWARE,"I want to start by saying my computer is running a Pentium 4 w/Hyper Thread Technology, CPU 3.0 GHz with 800 MHz/FSB..not a ""killer"" system, but no slouch either.  I also have cable high speed internet.  Prior to purchasing this camera two days ago, I had a Logitech Orbit and a Philips SB900 web cam running with no problems and a good clear picture with good audio when I did video conferencing through Skype.  I loaded the software that came with the camera, which was Version 10.0.  I started using Skype, and the first thing said to me was the pictured appeared somewhat blurred and the angle was very wide.  I zoomed in some, but since the camera uses digital zoom, the picture became more blurred.  The way to fix the problem was that I had to sit as closely to the desk as possible and lean in a little.  When I did this, I was told that the picture was very clear.  Now the bad - the software supplied with the camera is a RAM hog !!  Part of the problem is that the software (not just the drivers, but the entire suite) used to run the camera is 130MB !!  That is huge (for a USB webcam).  The camera, while running in Skype caused my CPU usage to shoot to 85%.  With the other two cameras it was normally around 25%.  I then went to the Logitech site and downloaded version 10.0.4 of the Orbit MP software.  While it dropped my CPU usage to around 25%-30%, my teleconferencing in Skype was terrible.  The audio was distorted with bad latency, the picture was even worse than before, and my movement was extremely robotic.  Then the worst thing happened...my computer rebooted on its own.  After it rebooted completely, I logged back into Skype and in less that 10 minutes, it rebooted again !!!  Needless to say, I disconnected the camera, uninstalled the software, and took the camera back to the store today.  My recommendation is to stay away from the Orbit MP until Logitech fixes the bugs.    "

electronics,0 of 2,4.0,Active subwoofer,"I bought this receiver a couple of weeks ago and it's been working great so far. However, I realized that it can only be used with an active subwoofer and I did not have one. I am here to ask your opinion on a reasonably good sub woofer system that works with this receiver. Thanks in advance for your answer"
electronics,13 of 15,1.0,Please read this editorial before you purchase ANY iPod!! Don't do what I did and buy 2 that failed!,"Ok, so if you are the average consumer, such as myself, you probably have an mp3 player of some sort. If you own an Apple iPod, then you and I along with 58 million other unsuspecting consumers have been had. BIG TIME. I too fell into the trance of the white earbuds, but no longer will I remain an Apple lemur. I bought a 4th generation iPod and was so excited that I too was going to be sporting the ultimate in mp3 players!! Boy, was I STUPID!!! I commute to Boston on the commuter rail, which is about a forty-minute ride into town, switch to the subway for 10 minutes, and then walk to my building in about 3 minutes. I am not a runner so when I say walk it's a stroll. Nothing aggressive. After about 2 and � months with my new toy, the problems began. Freeze ups began to occur in the middle of playing songs. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Works very well, easy to use","I like this unit.  It works well, has many points of interest, doesn't seem to lose signal and it's accurate.  Touch screen is easy to use, sounds is good, mounting works well."

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Don't Be Fooled By The Cheap Price,"Don't Be Fooled By The Cheap Price!  This card is a breeze to install.  First install the software, then install the card, turn your computer back on, and your ready for the internet or to connect to a network!  I have installed at least five of these cards into computers over the past year, and have not gotten one call that they are not working!  This is a great price point, and great product. "

electronics,11 of 11,4.0,"Good, basic, inexpensive player","I noticed that there wasn't a lot of reviews for this player on Amazon, so I thought I'd add my thoughts as I just purchased the P1850.  (Though it looks like its about to be discontinued - doh)"
electronics,5 of 20,1.0,Motorola 2 way radios,"I originally had a problem with the charger unit.  I got a quick response from amazon.  They sent another motorola unit out to me.  This unit works great, I have been pleased with the customer service from amazon.  I also have been pleased with my purchase order.  It has better range and more features then the old motorola radios I used to have, plus the price was right!  It's everything I expected. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Accurate, but a little small (it *is* a Notebook mouse)","The best feature in this mouse is the way the cord winds around the base- pure genius.  It works as it should, but try getting a mouse pad- I know they call it an all terrain sensor- But it's not.  When used with a pad or on a white smooth surface, it works like a dream."
electronics,2 of 4,2.0,"No bass, ok sound isolation, but doesn't beat my old noise cancellation headphones","This definitely does not have full range.  Some songs I listen to have very low base frequencies.  I would have been fine if I could hear it, but it was quieter.  That's what I was expecting.  To my surprise, entire bass lines were completely absent from the songs when listened to through these E2s.  And the sound isolation is something I'm new to.  I've been using old AIWA noise cancellation headphones, which work better.  Whether you want isolation or cancellation, my bet is that there's a much better product for the price, and I intend to find it"
electronics,,1.0,Interference!!,"Don't buy these speakers, despite the attractive price, if you plan on using a cell phone anywhere near them. The interference is soo horrible, it makes this painfully loud and anoying buzzing/popping noise because they are not properly shielded by cell phone interference. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,A NEWBIE WHO LOVES HER VISTA!,"This is my first GPS unit that I bought in June 2006 after discovering the wonderful world of geocaching.  Having zero experience with GPS, I spent a couple months researching devices and, most importantly, reading what other users were saying about their hand-held units.  The short of it was that after all the info I had gathered, I decided on the Vista CX.  It's a middle-of-the-road GPS unit-- I didn't want to go too cheap and end up having to update 6 months later, but I couldn't affort 700 or 800 dollars, either.  This device fits perfectly."
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Hearing Aid Compatable,The reason I gave this phone such a high review is it is the only cordless Digital 5.8 GHz phone that worked with my mothers hearing aids.  All the other phones we tried of this type did not work even though they are required to by FCC regulations. 
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,Cleaning machine... didn't repair.,The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd's/dvd's.  I can't give a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd... and it did not repair it
electronics,,5.0,Easy cell phone management,"The included software makes it easy to manage Pictures, Names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Adapter Cable works great. Easy software updates at the Nokia web site."
electronics,3 of 10,2.0,Early Adopting,"Don't get me wrong, staying on the cutting edge of technology affords bragging rights and gobs of ear and eye candy, however the exterior of this unit looks like it was manufactured in the 1980's.  Features, looks and specs will vastly improve with the '07 models across the board.  Just an observation while you drop your hundreds here"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,A rock solid piece of networking gear,"This thing runs flat out all the time, wired and wireless. It has an excellent amount of tweakability. Once you figure out what a lot of the options even do you'll feel like a networking pro. The quality of service (QoS) stuff actually works as advertised, it's amazing once you have everything configured to have this router so dynamically manage your bandwidth - it almost makes you feel like you have an unlimited net connection."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best thing you can buy for a desktop replacement,"I use this awesome piece of equipment for my 17 inch widescreen dell desktop replacement...I have a logitech wirelss gamepad conncet, jbl on tour speakers, logitech cordless mouse and keyboard all at once...its perfect...my speakers connceted directly to the audio port...it works if you have 2.0 or 5.1 audio....and the stand is just great..it comes with all this info to help you deceide what height you set the stand at...also has a clipboard on the stand for documents...keeps everything organized...and if you need to be portable with your laptop..you just unplug the usb from the stand and your all set to go..converting your desktop replacement to a mean portable laptop. Definetely well worth the money. Also great tech support from kensington"
electronics,12 of 13,2.0,it's a lemon,"I was ready to really love this pda. It's nice and thin, feels good in the hand and was the cheapest PDA with wireless. I mainly needed it to check my email when i'm out and about."

electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Perfect for the designer,"Whether or not you are a 2D or 3D artist, this tablet makes it all the more enjoyable. I had an Aiptek 12000U which died no less than 3 weeks from purchase date. This Wacom is so much better."
electronics,28 of 30,1.0,Complete Waste of Money,"Marc Anderson's review below hits the nail on the head. This is possibly the most useless TV tool and/or calibration tool that has ever been marketed. It is about as high tec as a plastic pair of 3-D glasses and about as useful also. When you buy a calibration disc you are not interested in someone's singing career or her ""cutsy"" expressions about calibration. This really is a disc that explains the 4-5 basic components of TV calibration whilst leaving the viewer hanging at the point where more info. is necessary. It may be helpful to someone who has not owned a color TV in the last 45 years but otherwise there is no value added. It is certainly easy to use because there is nothing really to use. Absolutely terrible"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,"Excellent heaphone, screaming deal","The Sennheiser HD 595 is an excellent headphone.  It has bass that really reaches down when the music calls for it without becoming boomy or unnatural.  The midrange and treble are quite pleasant; they are (according to other reviews) more forward and bright than other high-end Sennheisers like the 600 and 650, but they never sound unnatural or strident to me."

But then I needed one for a Dell Inspiron 9300 and while the iGo would power the laptop it would not charge the battery. iGo (support is dismal) said it was because Dell did something to their laptops to prevent third part adapters charging the battery.... yeah, pull the other one, it has a bell on it.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,sausalitoron,"I have a Canon S820 printer.  I tried the non-Canon replacement cartridges from several dealers on this site.  None of them produced a decent picture, despite their promises.  I certainly do not like paying these high prices for the Canon cartridges, but they consistantly produce great pictures and other documents"
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,Would not recommend - no warranty,"I just purchased this item and even though Amazons website says there is a warranty, I just got off the phone with amazon customer service and they confirm these are refurbrished units and were going to update the website to indicate that there is in fact no warranty provided"
electronics,3 of 11,2.0,Not pleased with the BRICK,"I give it a 2 only because it is a good music player.  I owned the 30GB for 6 months and loved it.  The sound quality is great, navigation is simple, making playlists is no problem, video picture is super, and the Zen's reputation for quality (despite the last guy's misfortune) is high.  FM tuner and voice recorder over the Ipod are nice additions, if you use them.  And, by the way, the FM tuner tunes into station perfectly and sounds very good.  Under pressure from the RIAA, Creative REMOVED THE FM RECORDER that is on the 30GB model.  Don't worry about it, though, the quality was pretty poor anyway.  My real gripe is the size. It was already too thick, now this thing is as thick as a deck of cards!  I measured it at 7/8 of an inch.  Compare that to the 80gb Ipod at about 1/2 inch (.55 inch to be exact).  And it's as heavy as a brick.  You can also hear and feel the hard drive operating, it's not load or a bad vibration, but it's there.  I'm just not as pleased with this version as with the 30GB model.  Creative should have made this smaller and more refined, while still making the storage space larger.  That's what good electronics companies do.  THEY FAILED MISERABLY HERE.  If you don't care about the FM tuner or voice recorder, pay $25 more for the new 80GB Ipod. "
electronics,5 of 7,5.0,2GB Memory Stick is great!,"With this memory stick I don't have to worry about running out of memory on my vacation. I can take as many pictures and movies as I want and not have to worry about downloading in the middle of my vacation. This gives me over 600 six-megapixel pictures. I can shoot them and then crop and edit them to size or print them at 8-1/2 by 11. When combining this with 2500MAh NiMH batteries, I can shoot for two days without even changing the batteries in my camera."

electronics,11 of 15,5.0,It's like a whole new world!,"I am just thrilled every time I sit down in front of this monitor.  My previous monitor is a Sony Trinitron 21"" Flat Screen Hi Res CRT monitor and it pales (literally) in comparison to the HP f2105p.  The color, detail, and refresh speed are outstanding.  It is very bright without washing out.  I love to watch the aquarium screen saver on it, it looks so real!"
electronics,,5.0,Expandable Phones are Great!,I already had the master unit and one expandable phone.  They worked so well that I replaced my last 2 standard phones with these.  I couldn't be more pleased with this decision.  It makes unit placement much more flexible and sound quality exceptional
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,yay radio,this is a great system for any work area. great variety of music and VERY easy to hook up to an existing speaker system. great buy. easy to use
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Works Perfectly, Easy to Install","Within 15 minutes of receiving this card I had my local area network up and running between two computers.  Admittedly, I was looking to do something very simple: two computers, side by side, connected with an RJ45 cable (not included with the card).  The drivers included on the CD-ROM work fine with Windows 98.  My only complaints are that the card sticks out of the PCMCIA slot about an inch and that if you remove the card and reinsert it the card needs to reinstall (a simple process).  I bought this card as a cheap test to see if I could set up a simple network before trying to tackle a wireless network.  I am so satisfied that I will probably buy D-Link wireless hardware"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,works great,"This product works great.  It's been very sturdy (though I haven't taken in mountain biking yet).  Other reviewers and I share a common complaint- the back is hard to secure with the twisting lock.  Careful use of needlenose pliers takes care of that, though.  Besides, even with the mounting back my e-Trex still fits in the neoprene case, so I don't have to switch the backs unless I'm going to change batteries"

Way too small, terrible velcro dots that rarely match up, and made of material that MIGHT last a week before it breaks.  And the price?  Are you kidding me?  I returned this and got the Speck armband - much better!!"
electronics,2 of 6,4.0,"Good, but could be better","This is a great product with much better connections than my old Sony amp.

electronics,3 of 4,1.0,not usable due to SonicStage,"Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each ""artist"" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library."

They block outside noise and fit comfortably on your head and ears.  These headphones are a great value and I will enjoy them for years.  Recommend highly!!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Works great, only one minor issue","I bought this item after I using a cassette adapter with my iPod mini for some time, then purchased a newer car which to my dismay had no tape player.  I like this a lot for 3 main reasons: 1) it is  great improvement over the cassette adapter quality-wise, 2) it charges the iPod while it's transmitting too (I've heard some of the portable chargers can drain the iPod's battery very quickly), and 3) it has this great adjustable arm so I can bend it towards me for a quick song skip at a stoplight, or the person in the passenger seat can bend it towards them to browse through my playlists."
electronics,,4.0,FYI - Receiver is no longer adjustable to 90 degrees,"I received a previous version of this mouse as a promotional gift from Microsoft, and since have not been able to separate myself from it whenever I travel.  It is the most ""plug and play"" piece of hardware I have ever purchased for a pc (noteboook or otherwise) -- no software installation or complicated setup necessary.  It of course does not have the bells and whistles that the Logitech Revolution series mice have (ie. tilt wheel/side to side scrolling, customizable buttons, and easily-accessible forward/back buttons for fast and efficient web browsing), but for basic functionality, this mouse simply cannot be beaten.  As a travel companion, it is extraordinarily lightweight and low maintenance -- with its snap-in receiver, there are no worries of ever leaving for a business trip with unnecessary weight or having to account for multiple devices/attachments just to make offsite work more tolerable (ie. why bring a mouse when just using the laptop's touchpad was a better option than having to worry about one more thing to keep track of?).  This mouse, however, has me spoiled -- I even use it while working on my laptop at home, sitting on my couch (the optical laser even works quite well on the surface of a leather couch!).  The soft-touch buttons and scroll wheel are also amazingly easy on the hand when doing a ton of repetitive movements.  One thing of importance to note, however, is that the version I got from Amazon does *not* have the same adjustable receiver that my promotional version has.  While the receiver still easily and conveniently snaps into the bottom of the mouse, it sticks out quite a bit more than the adjustable version does, and resultingly would also not work as well with notebooks that have a vertical (as opposed to horizontal) USB port.  Nevertheless, this is such a great mouse I felt compelled to have more than just one"
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,Awesome!,"I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. "
electronics,13 of 14,5.0,"Durable, Roomy, Stylish","This is by far the best notebook backpack I found.  My laptop is a 15.5&quot; and its hard to to find a backpack that wasnt HUGE.  This doesnt look huge but it has so much room inside it and plenty of space for books, disc, power cords, a mouse, etc.  I also think its well made and  has enough padding to protect  your laptop.  The zippers are great!!! Really smooth and it never feels like its sticking.  Its also a lot easier on your back than one of the messenger style notebook cases!  It also comes with a lifetime warrenty if you fill out the card and mail it back (at least mine did...it was inside the bag)"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Wi-Fi Card Review,I do not recomend this card. I bought one and it is very flaky. Works one time and next time does not. Keep getting error that it is not compatible with my E2.  Looks up my palm and I have to soft boot to get back working. When it is woring the range is horrible. I would say there must be a better solution in the near future.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,The best printer I've ever used,"I can't say enough about this product.  Quality is great, printing is fast, and the wireless feature is amazing and convenient.  The product comes with 'starter' ink cartridges, however they have lasted me for months.  FAXing works great, 2-sided copying (BW or color) works flawlessly, and scanning is high-quality and easy to use.  Also works great with the camera.  The unit is stylish and I like the auto sleep feature.  Hats off to HP"

Tried a number of other brands and quality of card stock and nothing can compare.  Today, I printed an 8 1/2 x 11 - AWESOME.  I know that is an overused word, but it does describe the results of this winning combo - Canon i950 and Canon Photo Paper Pro"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Not What I Had Hoped For,"The WiFi Finder Plus is not what I had hoped for.  I used my notebook all over a local sandwich shop with excellent signal strength.  The Finder said the signal was medium to nonexistant.  The same is true for my home wireless network.  The Finder gave a much lower signal strength than the notebook indicated.  (Oh, and the included flashlight on mine is practically unuseable.  The button that activates it is tight and difficult to use.)  Anyway, I plan on keeping it for use on trips.  I guess if I get a signal at all with the Finder, it will be a good place to use the notebook"

electronics,7 of 7,4.0,great value for iPod users/music lovers,"I love this iPod docking system.  The speakers are great with very good quality sound - better than our dedicated stereo system.  Nice to have my iPod always charged & to have more listening versatility.  I would give this a 5-star rating if it had a remote; otherwise, very happy with my purchase."

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Best Headset I've Used,I've tried a lot of headsets in the below $25 category and this is best for sound quailty.With other headsets either I sound muffled or the person I am talking to is too quiet or muffled. With the Uniden I can hear people clearly and they can hear me perfectly. Most people don't even know I'm on a headset. Some of the reviewers have had problems with the microphone but in all I've had 5 of these and have never had a microphone problem. (I have three phones that use headsets.)I will agree that they can break easily but I found a fix for that - the headband has a weak point where it extends for larger heads.  I just put tape around that point so it can't extend and not one has broken since. I've rated this 4 instead of 5 stars because of having to tape it so it won't break
electronics,,5.0,ab-GA,This phone has every feature I was looking for - and alot more too.  It is very simple to set up and is user friendly.  I love it
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,A Whole New Level Of Digital Audio!!!,"I cannot even begin to tell you how great this card sounds, espcially when used with the CRX100E CD-RW Drive Unit from Sony Electronics"
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,don't waste your money,"If I could give these negative stars, I would.  I bought these thinking they'd be great for the gym.  WRONG.  They continuously fell off, so often it was annoying not only me, but the girl on the treadmill next to me. Not only that, but the ten seconds they did stay on, they bounced around and made a rattling noise so loud, I couldn't even hear the music I was listening to.  I highly recommend you forget these duds.  I'm going to purchase another pair of Sony h.ear MDR-J20 headphones, which is what I bought these to replace because I slammed the car door on the cord of my original pair"
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,"Good Product, But . . . .","Other reviews mention that the directions leave much to be desired.  I'll second that analysis, but a methodical approach utilizing the few hard and fast rules within the directions should get a user up and running."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent Batteries - True to their Stated Capacity,"I've tested many different brands of rechargeable batteries, and have in total over 40 of them. These are the best so far. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Read first - How to use foam tips and get GREAT bass response,"I've seen a number of reviews complaining of bad bass response for these headphones.  I used the rubber tips for 2 months and agreed whole-heartedly that these things had great mids and highs, but no bass.  Then I figured out how to use the foam tips and it made a world of difference.  Since I have several friends who also took a while to figure it out, and from the posts here, it appears we are not alone, I figured I'd post this."
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Muddy Sound,You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Correcting some factual errors,"I agree with the general contention of the above two reviewers that a fairer price for this cable would be around $50-60, rather than $100.  However there are a couple of factual errors in their reviews.  First, Monster cables *are* ATC-certified and are indeed allowed to display the HDMI logo -- check any box!  Second, just because they carry digital data does not mean that HDMI/DVI cables are immune to noise -- they are quite susceptible to noise.  It is easy for electrical interference from neighboring devices to flip bits (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) on a cable.  Indeed HDMI cables have been demonstrated to suffer from significant degradation in signal quality without adequate sheilding, so a good cable like Monster's has some merit.  There are any number of website which will certify to that.  Unlike in computer networks, which use extensive re-transmission of corrupted packets to recover from noise, the tremendous bandwidth and real-time nature of TV viewing make re-transmission impossible in any TV cable.  Thus a good quality HDMI cable is not the same as a bad one."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best price for what you get,"After purchasing this memory card, I realized I should have purchased it with my camera instead of waiting as long as I did.  Before this upgrade, my camera had a maximum of 18 3.2mp pictures.  Now I can take 611.  I can also now use the video feature of my camera without fear of filling it up."
electronics,8 of 12,5.0,Creative does a great job this time,"I've been a Turtle Beach lover because I'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but can't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio. The quality Turtle Beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value. Been using Santa Cruz for years and it runs great. After upgrading CPU/Motherboard and to Z-5500, found the Santa Cruz seems to be lagging, usually about 3-5 glitches (sudden stop of sound) during mp3 playback. It might be my system's problem but anyway upgrade to Montego DDL fixed the problem. Used optical output on Montego DDL and it sounds good enough to me. But Montego DDL has a microphone problem (too low volume) that I can't live with."
electronics,,4.0,Great value for price!,"Easy to use. Battery life is decent. Earbuds are decent quality. Armband and clear case are great for working out, running, and even working in the yard."
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,pleasant surprise,I ordered this DVD player Wednesday mid-afternoon (Oct 11). To my surprise when I returned home Friday afternoon (Oct 13) it was on my porch. I can't imagine how such service could happen but it did.
electronics,,5.0,Not just for gaming,"I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended"
electronics,,5.0,D-Link DWL-G710 ,The D-Link line of wireless accessories are the best.  They just work.  I have installed and configured nearly every major brand of wireless router and accessories and I have found the D-Link's to be the most reliable
electronics,,5.0,Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro is awesome!,"Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro produces excellent sound quality, transparent sound, very good bass, mid and treble.  It's also very effective in suppressing external noise and you can wear it while walking on the side of the street, on the noisy train, subway and buses.  It's also very comfortable, you can wear it for hours.  I got it at around 30% discount off the list price at Amazon, it's definitely a very good value for money!"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Good product,"Folds nicely, sound quality good.  Would be better if it included a volume control and mute button"
electronics,,2.0,clunky,I got this because the original earphones hurt my ear. Using this definitely helped but it is still a little uncomfortable. There are some pointy edges on the earjam that still pricks the ear while in use. I bought myself a Sony Fontopia ear bud and am extremely happy with it.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works great.,"I wanted a cheap portable phone to connect to my new Vonage service.  The Uniden fit the bill.  As a plus, the batteries are the same as my other Uniden phone."
electronics,,1.0,No More TV Listings?,"This is actually a pretty good remote and the setup for configuration is usable.  However, it appears Logitech has stopped providing downloadable TV listings to the remote.  This makes the remote much too expensive and defeats a big benefit.  It also call into question Logitech's commitment to newer remotes"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Better than the best DVD players out there with my TV,"OK let me tell everyone my story. I purchased a WestingHouse 37"" HD LCD Monitor that has 2 DVI Inputs. I have my computer hooked up using DVI 1080P which is superb and this DVD player hooked up to the 2nd DVI 1080I input. This DVD player works perfectly. I do agree with a couple of the critizisms posted earlier (I'm reading everybodys) like the rewindind, fastforwarding is choppy and impossible to stop precisely where you want it to, but who cares. I do have to directly point the remote just right to it, but I was never bothered by it (Maybe it's because of location i have it in)... "
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Big and Bad,Plenty of room for every plug.  Has all the extra features and is a great investment
electronics,,5.0,GR8,I am very happy with this product - Although I wish the ink would last a little but longert - I have printed about 75 pictures and it's recommending replacing the ink cartridg
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great for my mp3 player,"I love this 512mb SD card, its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a 1gig SD card too."
electronics,,5.0,"Used to have one, need to replace it!","Motorola used to sell a Flexible Ear Receiver with a standard earphone plug (3.5mm, I think) that I used with a walkie talkie at work.  It fit my ear perfectly, and is adjustable to boot (sorry, Brian, but maybe you're putting it on wrong...).  It was about the only thing I could comfortably wear all day (I can't stand having one of those earbuds jammed in my canal).  I found it also worked great with my portable radio, CD player, and laptop (mono only, obviously).  Unfortunately, Motorola says they don't make that configuration any more.  The Receiver shown here is their new model, which has a much smaller (2mm?) plug.  If you have compatible equipment, however, this should be a comfortable and useful accessory.  It's especially good if you listen more than you talk - I could hear everything with the radio clipped to my belt as I went about my day, and when I picked it up to talk into it, people could tell I was ""on the phone."" "
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Picture this,Easy to set up and use with very acceptable quality of video. A good value..
electronics,,5.0,Awesome wallet,"I don't normally review products that I have purchased but this Body Glove wallet is worth it. Looks awesome, feels awesome, and is built good. For the price you can not go wrong, I would buy this over again in a heartbeat if, when I need another wallet"
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,Grundig FR200 AM/FM Shortwave ,"Excellent, very useful during power outages."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,"Good and noise-canceeling, but fit depends on you","I purchased these for my Shure E2Cs (yes, they can be made to fit, even though not designed for the E2Cs--you just need to be determined and place pressure on the posts of the phones, to fit the larger posts into the smaller sleeve holes). I find them good at cancelling noise, such that I use these when I fly--they do a slightly better job than my Sony noise-cancelling earbuds. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy,We have a Canon iP4000 printer and the photos printed on this paper is by far the best out of the all of the brands we've tried.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"For the price and quality of this camera, you can't go wrong!!","I purchased the DCS-G900 in August and it works as advertised.   It can be accessed and administered with just your web browser (type the camera's IP address into the address bar), or you can use the IPView Lite SE that comes with the camera to gain some extra features like Motion Detection, multiple camera control (up to 4) within the same IPView window and the ability to rotate the image 90 degrees (the internal camera settings will allow you to only mirror and\or flip the image, not turn it 90 degrees)."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent value,"You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to show pictures and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. The new 30 and 80 GB models have improved battery life, but I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,excellent product,"I have never had any problems with this ink cartridge. Never clogs like the lexmark. Easy to replace, also"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Outstanding value,"Being a headphone freak since I was first turned on to them in 1968 Viet Nam. I find these to be a good pair to use with my portable CD player while working at my P.C. I have numerous and sundry headphone, from high end Sennheiser, to junky chepos that I purchased because of my headphone fetish. I even own a couple of the vaunted sound canceling phone."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Netgear WGR614 Router,"After a hassle with Hawking over A RMA for a bad router, I decided to purchase the Netgear. It installed very easy and quick. I was and still am very happy. It has more range tha any of the previous Routers I have used including Linksys and Hawking. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Great sound, low price = a must have!","Received this Sony MDR-E21LP yesterday and used it immediately. Wow, sounded beautifully and fit comfortable in my ears. The length of the cord is long enough for me or maybe a little too long. Also I like the material of the cord, it is very flexilbe and so less chance of tangle up."
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Canon BCI-6BK Black Ink Tank,"I have a Canon Pixma MP780 multipurpose printer.  Amazon sells the Canon ink tanks for a pretty good price, and often I get free shipping when I order them.  "
electronics,,4.0,Solid,"I got two of these, and as others have said, this is a great game pad for the money. It feels sturdy and has good, well placed, buttons."
electronics,15 of 16,1.0,Not worth the 5 bucks you pay,"I bought this piece of junk thinking i would try my luck since it was only 5 bucks. Well, now i know, i should stick to the casino's if i wanna try my luck. The tape was reversing from side A to B continuosly. So, following the instructions of another user, i opened the tape and took out the black wheel next to the cassette head. That stopped the reversing, but the volume was so low you could barely hear it even after turning up the Ipod's and the Stereo's volume. I have a 30 GB Video Ipod and a Volkswagen Passat Factory installed Monsoon audio system. Do NOT buy this piece of junk, keep looking. I heard the Sony cassette adapter is good, so i'm gonna try that next. Good luck.."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Not the OEM stylus at all,This is a cheap lightweight substitute made to sell at a low price point. I would gladly pay $20 for ONE of the original weighty styli that came with my TX
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,nice device indeed but the mini-optical port will cost you extra,"If you want to hook your airport express to your stereo via optical cable, you can; but you will need to buy a ""mini-optical"" cable or buy a little connector-converter for your regular-size optical cable.   "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The best of the breed.,"When I first purchased the Promedia 2.0's from best buy, I was looking for something high quality and compact.  What I didn't count on was that once again Klipsch incorporated both the best design and materials possible,  these little speakers roar.  "
electronics,,5.0,Great Old Phone ,I have owned my AT&T Trimline phone since 1995 and it has worked perfectly since. It's one of the few things I own that I can always count on. It isn't fancy but it works.
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Ignore the other review (but this thing does suck),"The other reviewer of this product obviously didn't read the directions.  First of all, the unit comes with a piece that secures the battery in the remote.  Second, I am assuming it is a limitation of the iPod's software, but when the remote adapter is plugged in, the iPod is supposed to say it is OK to disconnect.  Having said that, the unit does suck.  When the adapter is plugged in, you cannot use the iPod's controls or view anything on its screen.  The remote is very buggy and often loses its connection to the iPod.  If you go through songs too quickly, the information displayed on the screen will not always be correct.  The iPod doesn't always respond to the remote.  You can hear a buzzing in your earphones when information is being transferred to the remote.  Battery life is pathetic.  Finally, the remote scratches easily and is ugly.  Suffice it to say, I returned mine"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Battery problems,"When it works, it's mediocre. Unfortunately it doesn't work all that often. I had battery problems a month or two after purchase. Pass on this one, folks"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,BANG for the buck?  Heck yeah!!,This set is incredible.  Don't worry about the previous reviews about too much bass.  Anyone who would bother buying these speakers should have a quality soundcard such as an Audigy or X-Fi.  Those components have software suites which allow you to make these speakers sound however you'd like to have em sound.  You want to do some remodelling in the bathroom?  Throw these badboys in there and close the door....crank the volume and wait about 3 minutes.....scrape anything that hasn't fallen off the wall......and repeat if necessary.
electronics,,4.0,Watch out Navigation Trickers,"If you apply the last update to the Ipod Software (the one that let you play new games, and video podcast), the Navigtion Trick will no longer work.  In the case of my 60Gb Ipod video, I've had to restore an old software version in order to get the navigation trick working agai"
electronics,12 of 13,1.0,Don't waste your money on this overpriced ripoff,"Speaking from real experience, don't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price. I bought a few top of the line monster cables once I got the top of the line SONY XBR960 HDTV. Later on I switched cables around, with other brand, cheaper component cables such as Philips PTS1000 (the HDMI standard owner by the way), and also other HDMI cables (even no name brands coming with my DVD player). You know what? I see absolutely no difference even under close examination. The SONY XBR960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any TV. You think about what that means. Stop buying this ridiculously priced cables, and save your $$ and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list. Digital is digital. Don't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010 ... than others."

electronics,6 of 9,5.0,DVI to HDMI Converter,This device works as advertised and seems to be well-constructed.  But be aware that the picture associated with the description is actually for the reverse converter
electronics,,4.0,Highly utilitarian,"For the price (got it at a discount on here), this is a good value. Used this case as compact and portable DVD storage."
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Great wireless socket card if you stick with sharp rom,"If you stik with a sharp rom, no problem. Stick it in, n voila, you&lt;re wireless ready. But if you go for openzarus or other rom, be ready for headaches"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Good for demos and budget home studios,This is a great value as it can power a condenser mic as well as being a recording interface.
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Constant Connection Problems,I have bluetooth built in to my laptop (Dell Inspiron 9300) and I haven't had problems with anything except for this keyboard and mouse.  The mouse works fine except that it's kind of jumpy.  The keyboard requires me to go through the bluetooth reinstall process every couple days.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Panasonic Phone,I bought this for my son's dorm room.  He enjoys it and it is a very clear phone.  I have the three phone Panasonic system and I am very please with it.  I recommend a buy for this product the only reason that I did not give it a 5 star as I know that there are phones with more features for more money.  I would give this phone 5 star for price and reliablity
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Make your mp3/ipod sound deeeeeluxe!,Life without music would be to me like a bird denied wings. 
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Decent Price for High Quality Speaker Cables..,"Although true audiophiles might turn their cheek to lower-priced speaker cables (i.e. anything under $100 for 20ft), the quality of the sound produced is generally a matter of personal opinion. It is true, however, that even those with ""virgin"" ears may notice the difference between the flimsy ""pre-packaged"" speaker cables that come with your everyday Home-Theatre-In-a-Box, compared to the higher quality 16 gauge speaker cable that are sold independantly. These Monster XP cables are no exception. They aren't $200/foot like some exotic speaker cables are but they are adequate and reasonably priced enough to replace pre-packaged home theatre speaker wire without burning a hole through your wallet. For someone who wants to replace their HTIB speaker cables with something a little more sturdy that have better sound rendition and are more reliable, these Monster XP's are for you"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Ignore any of the negative reviews...,"If you're tired of headphones with mediocre sound, and you realize that over the ear phones really is the only way to get superior sound, buy these now. All the negatives aside, cheap plastic housing, short battery life, short headphone life, you will not be disappointed. I will never be without a set of these headphones again. Next up is the 2.5mm set for my E815. BTW if you remember to switch off your sub when not in use, your battery will last forever"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Escort S2 Radar Detector,"Basically the Escort S2 is the best cordless detector you can buy. I've owned the Escort S2 for a few weeks now and I must say I am quiet impressed. The unit gives LONG range warning so that it does what its designed to do, eliminate speeding tickets. The unit has tons of features overall and I am happy to say its well worth the money, you will not be sorry you purchased this product"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Amazon-stocked item may not support WPA,"The item Amazon shipped to me was version 1.1--this version does NOT support WPA (and can't be upgraded to support WPA with a simple firmware upgrade, either).  The current version is version 3"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The BEST Pocket-Size Digital Radio,"This is the second time I have purchased this model Pocket Digital Radio.  First one purchased about three years ago.  Misplaced the first one and wanted to replace it with the same model.  Features available on this Sangean radio totally work as advertised. For such a small speaker, the sound is great, even better using ear buds."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Perfect for long road trips,"Was perfect for running a laptop on a cross country trip.  Highly recommend.  Wish there was a way to tuck the long cords somewhere since they take up a lot of space, particularly if you don't need that much cord length"
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,Bad design,Only works with Windows media player for transfers
electronics,,5.0,FAST DELIVERY !! PACKAGING !! EXCELLENT !! AAAAAA++++++++,"Thanks for everything, quick transaction....highly reccommend "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Convenient size and well built,"I am very happy with this CD binder.  Discs slip in easily, and organization is simple.  Pages can be moved with only minor difficulty.  The koskin has a nice profesional looking texture.  There is a strong handle integrated into the outside of the spine to allow you to carry the binder conveniently.  I have filled one up completely and notice it is a tad heavy and so I would not recommend a size larger than this 264-disc one."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Terrible,     Am very disappointed with both the unit and Samsung service.  The unit started rejecting all discs...no matter what format...after only two weeks.  Samsung service insisted that I try a cleaning disc before they do anything.  They couldn't understand that the unit was rejecting ALL discs.
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Boostaroo for you too!!,"If you have an iPod, I call mine the gregPod, then you need a Boostaroo.  The little white earbuds that come with the iPod SUCK.  They sound horrible.  If you don't realize that those earbuds sound dreadful, you are strange.  So, get some good headphones, and get the Boostaroo to power them.  The headphone amplifier inside the iPod is not capable of powering large headphones.  The Boostaroo is not only capable of powering large headphones, but it will also make them sound better.  The lower bass is much better defined.  The high frequencies are cleaner, with more sparkle.  And, the volume setting on the iPod can be decreased, thus extending the life of the Litium Ion battery."
electronics,,5.0,great even for laptops,"I use this with my laptop with the geforce 7800, I was tired of my hands getting so warm on the keyboard and this was the perfect answer, playing HL-ep 1 was such a better experience with the fang:)"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,How to get it working again!,"True, this little guy freezes from time to time when you forget to dismount it properly (NOT creatives fault!). It's pretty easy to reformat if you people who say it's 'broken' used LINUX and not windows! Simple as that guys - no need to bother with with wasting your money on repair costs. Unbelievable."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Does good job for portable speakers.,The speakers fail when the volume it too high. Sound is acceptable when listening to music at your desk or in close proximity to the speakers. These speakers are not the sound solution for a party. Good job for what they are. Good design --not too bulky. Overall I'm quite satisfied
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,SanDisk Cruzer Micro 512 MB USB 2.0 Flash Drive ,This is the best overall form factor I've seen for a flash drive.  It fits easily on key chain so you're liable to keep it in your pocket and not loose it.
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,Garmin Car Kit Rocks,Just what you are looking for if you need or desire to have turn-by-turn street navigation capabilities in the Garmin handheld units this product works with. I brought it for my GPSMAP60cs and with the follow the road function enabled on my GPSr I am taken right to my destination. I like it! :)
electronics,,5.0,Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router (Compatible with Linux),"Since I installed it I have not had any problem at all. I installed it on my first floor where the signal is strong, but on the basement is weak, only a 22% strength"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Best Portable Headphones This Price Range,"You just dropped some cash on a new iPod (or any other portable music device/laptop) and all they give you are those little ear buds. Ear buds have their place (for being discreet, when wearing a hat, etc) but when you want to listen to the fine details in your music you have to step up to a better headset. I looked all over the web, read many reviews and by far, at this price, the PX 100 has the most stellar reviews. That includes comparisons to its more expensive siblings, the PX 200 and PX 250. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Well designed and easy to use,"I bought this player mainly for workouts and to play music through my old car radio/cassette player. It suits this purpose exceedingly well. I found the joystick/button system of selecting music and functions very intuitive, and the color screen is very effective and appealing. Another great feature for my use is the ability to record directly from an analog player, such as a boombox; this allows me to digitize my old cassette tapes very easily with respectable sound quality. The player sound quality itself is excellent with the provided earphones and can be nicely tweaked with the built-in equalizer. "
electronics,,5.0,I love it,This split cable allows me to charge the ipod while I'm putting songs onto it so I don't have to worry about the batteries running out in the middle of uploading songs.  Mine has worked great
electronics,,2.0,Bring on the memories,"The comments about when the dorm stereos were the equivalent of today's computers and ruled the dorms really jogged some memories.  I actually spent most of my ""dorm time"" time in an apt but I had the Crown (IC-150/D40), JBL Studio Monitors (Century 100s) and, of course, the Koss Pro 4AAs (believe that I bought them at the Frankfurt/M Main PX when in Germany).  As far as the weight, they really felt light when compared with my other set - which came with a ""commo"" helment and were attached to either a M-48A5 or M60A1 Main Battle Tank!"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Sennheiser PXC 250 produces good quality sound,"Sennheiser PXC 250 produces good quality sound with pretty effective noise cancellation, especially for use on the airplane.  Since the price has been reduced a lot, it's a good value for money!  The disadvantage is it's quite 'heavy' to drive for some portable player, due to high impedance (300 ohm) - you must increase the volume to around 70 to 80% of maximum in iPod to be able to drive it well"
electronics,,5.0,Perfect Earbuds for the iPod Nano,I've been on the lookout for replacement earbuds for my nano and finally found these. I think they are just awesome and believe Apple should bundle these with their nano. For the price this is a steal.
electronics,,5.0,Complete satisfaction,I recommend this item to all them who intend to buy 1 gb memory stick for their cameras and cells.
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Me-15 with WS-320M,"I use this microphone with an Olympus WS-320M digital recorder. I am a Pastor/Evangelist and I use this combination to record my sermons when I am preaching away from my home church. In addition, I use it to record my lectures at the Bible college where I teach."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,iRock 860,I purchased this item for an international trip so that I could download lots of music to enjoy -it was wonderful! I have noticed upon returning home and using the FM tuner that it uses a battery up rather quickly (in less than 2 hours). I am experimenting with using the batteries designed for electronics and hope this eliminates some of this problem. I do enjoy the product.

electronics,9 of 9,5.0,IPOD Killer!,"I've held off on buying a new MP3 player for over a year, anticipating the release of a great high capacity MP3.  Although IPOD just released their 80gig IPOD, I'm still definitely pleased with my purchase and the wait.  The color's are more vivid, it's not that big (2-3mm thicker than the 30gig version) the software is VERY easy to use, sound is excellent, has a lot of features and was reasonably priced. Worked just fine using Win Media Player (Creative did provide both Media Player 11 and their own organizing tool, but you can use anything to sync this up).  It takes almost every type of format you have without having to convert everything (and if you do, WMP does it for you).  You can search by album, genre, artist, etc., not sure what the other guy was doing wrong.  I haven't figured out if there's a way to shuffle all the songs you have on a particular artist yet.  It did take about 2 hours for the initial sync, but that's because I have 45gig of music, vids, and pics.  I've done all the large capacity reviews, read em all, tested the MP3's at the stores, etc, etc, and I have to say that the quality of the Creative is definitely the best overall MP3 on the market today. Only downsides I've found are the lack of all the accessories and that Creative needs to keep up with the market (hint, release a 80gig or better now!) and advertise more.  If they step that up, this can definitley be THE IPOD killer. I'm still waiting on the sport case to come in I ordered, hopefully it will fit (the company said it would), more to follow on that.  But, I've read that the sport cases actually scratch the player and would advise everybody to put the protective plastic on it before putting it in the case. Hopefully this helps you make a wise decision"
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Not recommended for all day,"Sound quality is good, and it's fine for occasional use, but I need a headset that I can wear for hours at a time - this one is just too uncomfortable"
electronics,7 of 13,5.0,Home Theatre Enthusiast,"You shouldn't have any doubt in your mind about buying these superb video cables.  They provide the highest quality picture on your tv.  Since there are three cables instead of one, more information, can be sent to the tv with better detail.  These cables have served me very well, and they have really improved the picture quality of my DVD player"
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Dissapointed,The LCD display sucks. The display does not seem to have any kind of backlight. All the extension flash until you assign them a number even if you have no extensions. According to Panasonic the phone should have a backlight. This is the second phone I am going to return
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,A very good solution for mounting your iPod,"The Belkin Tunedock achieves exactly what it sets out to do - provide a solid, flexible mounting solution for your iPod, iPod Mini or XM Radio (there are multiple versions of the 'dock).  The color of the iPod mount is off-white - closer to grey really.  The XM mount is black."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works great for us,"Interesting to read about people who have had reliability problems with this phone.  We've owned it since December 2004 and have NEVER had a problem with it.  The batteries have never run out, everything works fine, and I'm perfectly happy with the durability and sound quality"
electronics,3 of 6,5.0,Belkin SurgeMaster very useful for Home Theater owners,Hooking up a Home Theater involves many components. The Belkin SurgeMaster 9-oulets surge protector is really a blessing and allows a home theater owner to provide protection to often expensive components. Outlets are even provided for transformers
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Easy to swap ink cartridge,I bought this cartridge because black was the first to deplete in my 5 cartridge system. The swap was easy and fast and the printer immediately responded with better quality black printing
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,It takes a litlle getting used to but it is worth it,I have a small work area so not having to slide the mouse around is a pleasure
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Brilliant - user training required!,"Upon reading all the reviews on this site I was almost deterred into buying a head unit with an aux-in on the front but I'm now very glad I didn't. Reviewers here have been too quick to dismiss this product because of the navigation system without adapting to how to use the system best, or considering for a second, that you should not expect a head unit to behave in the same way an iPod does. It is not practical to have a knob that behaves like the ipod touch wheel and you can't expect the song titles to display quickly on a limited character display (eg. 12 characters)."
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,Also Disappointed,"I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. "
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,cable modem,I am happy that I purchased this modem as it saved me $5.00 in rental cost from my cable company.  It seems to make my Internet browsing faster and the price was very competitive
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent overall,I work in the high jungle of Peru. These radios were awesome!
electronics,,4.0,Real Shame,"It's a Shame that so many people can't get the CD Organizers to work, how ever I can't see what the Problems they are having are.  I've run these on 98, 2000 and XP with no Problems, I have three of them but could use more.  I've never had a Problem with XP Drivers, or the Systems not working the way they were supposed to, although I did have a Database error once, but if you rename the file to .MDB and run the access repair routine, it fixed the problem, and I just renamed it back"
electronics,,5.0,Haven't burned a coaster yet,"I have used these DVD-Rs for over two years now and they work absolutely great. I have burned movies, games, files, everything. Haven't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the DVD players I tried them out on."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Easy to use with nice features...,"This firewall router takes minutes to set up, has a nice web interface, and has run continuously for about a month.  "
electronics,,5.0,Can't Fly Without Them!,Excellent product for giving the smooth feel and control in computer flying simulation.
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Excellent external hard drive,This drive from Seagate I bought for work backups is in every way superior to the 200GB SimpleTech external I have at home. The most impressive difference is the sound. The SimpleTech sound like blenders by comparison.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Ideal product to hold your black iPod!,"The TuneDok is a great way to keep your iPod secure and close by while you enjoy music in the car. The suction cup keeps it from moving, even over very rough roads. There is space for an FM transmitter to be plugged in while it sits in the Dok.  It may be configured in multiple ways so that it will fit in any car with cupholders.  I wasn't sure I would buy one until the black model was available.  The black TuneDok matches my iPod and works great!  It's perfect."
electronics,6 of 10,5.0,Fabulous piece of networking equipment,All issue written by others below me have been resolved on the latest firmware update.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Fun and Functional,"Good quality and fairly adjustable in order to get a comfortable angle for viewing.  Does a great job of reducing neck strain from always looking down at my notebook screen.  Plus the price is right.  Though, it is a bit of an odd looking contraption when loaded with a computer.  I get a lot of questions in the office from folks who want to know what it is and many stares from passers by.  So, I would recommend it if you like attention"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great monitor,"i just love the monitor i bought    it appears to be larger than it is I think it is beacause it is nice and bright, the color is clear and all i can say is  i love i"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Definitly worth it if you want the best,"This cable isn't cheap. So why pay so much for it? Why not just buy a cheap s-video cable? Because the quality suffers. They don't just jack up the price for no reason. Gold tipped connecters, more shielding from interference, thicker wire, and better quality materials used provides a better picture. Colors are more vibrant, the whole picture more defined. You get what you pay for, and this Monster Cable is definitly proof of that. I have this cable and it is worth it. Monster all the way"
electronics,,5.0,AMAZING. A MUST BUY.,"Wow. I was convinced to buy this because of my friend, but I had no idea how fantastic the service was until I tried it. Now, I can't even watch tv without it. Pausing live tv is great, and so is the season pass option. Like a show? Just tell the tivo, and it will record all of that show regardless of channel or if there's a time change!"
electronics,,4.0,Great for the money,"I bought these earphones for my daughter.  She works and lives on a cruise line and needs isolation when listening to her music.  These earphones offer a great deal for the money.  They offer better than average sound quality, and good isolation.  They are not as good as the ER-4P earphones that I own, but for less than $100.00 you can't beat the ER6i"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Not an expert, but seems to work fine","I am not an expert on blank dvd's, but so far the Verbatim blank dvd's that I bought work fine.  They seem to be of fine quality.  I have burnt about half the spindle so far and have had only one failure. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Almost Perfect,"These cool JBL speakers are by far the best sound I have heard from small and relatively cheap speakers. Ideal for computer and iPod they provide a good overall sound, as long as you don't expect too much bass. They also happen to look very nice, sleek and modern. "
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Don't fit,I love the design and light-weight feel of these earbuds.  I can't even tell that I'm wearing them.
electronics,,1.0,Terrible quality- very high price,Don't waste your time with this.  
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,As Advertised - Flawless,"This unit performs flawlessly. I too was disappointed to see that some of the functions required drilling down through layer upon layer of menus ... Till I figured out that you can easily remap the menu position of your most used functions. I had a couple of other issues as well, but they were a result of not following directions precisely. I have a ReplayTV model 5040 and it handles that perfectly. Every product has the occasional lemon, but I suspect that the people having problems are, for the most part, suffering from the results of 'Operator Error'. I was in a bind and paid twenty bucks more because I needed the unit right away, and I STILL feel like I got MUCH more than my moneys worth"
electronics,,2.0,About mail in rebates,"I have subitted the rebate for this product in the month of Aug-06, till date Nov 2006, I have not received the rebates"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Can't beat these headphones for the money,"I've tried various headphones at various prices, and the sound quality of these AKG K26P headphones cannot be beat for the money.  They are durable, comfortable, and provide some noise attenuation. Since they're not too large, and you can fold them, they're also ideal to take in a carry-on bag, if you like listening while traveling.  I liked them so much I bought my wife a pair and she loves them too.  I was actually in the process of purchasing a pair for my brother for his birthday, when I decided to write this review."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Work Well,"These work very well with connecting my Sony DVD player to Panasonic Plasma.  Picture quality is good, as expected.  Amazon had a good price and delivered them free of charge in a reasonable amount of time.  My only concern is that the plastic covering/shielding on the ends of the cables is a little thick, and because my DVD player's outputs are very close to each other, the cables barely fit"
electronics,,4.0,Nice disks - bad package/delivery,I have almost 150 of these disks - very few coasters. I would definitely recommend these disks.
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Love this 'pod,"I got a shuffle a year ago and loved the quality, I was iffy to purchase a Nano due to my clutzy nature with electronics. I have to say, this baby is TOUGH, I love the brushed finish of the Aluminum casing, no fingerprints!!!My dog has sat on it...twice, it has fallen on the floor and I have fallen down the stairs with this in pocket.....Not ONE SCRATCH on the Ipod....Me, I had a nasty break in my tailbone. "
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Plug play be happy,Really nice and easy. I have my slingbox far away from my Linksys wireless router. So I followed the instructions and it worked with no problems at all. I could have used a wireless router to connect but this way is so much easier to use. Perfect.
electronics,4 of 6,4.0,jump drive,For an inexpensive jump drive I found this one to be very good. It was easy to use and convenient for transferring pictures from my computer to a printing station at the local photo developers
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"GREAT FOR A 32"" HDTV","This thing is very heavy duty. When I first went to install it, I predrilled the 2 holes, but one of the lag bolts broke off in the wall. So I had to move it about 2"" higher and bought some higher grade bolts (American Made Bolts) The bolts that come with it are CR-P! So before you install it - buy 2 new lag bolts. The back plate has holes for bolting the TV to it all over the place, so whatever TV you have it should work for it."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Quality, small size, performs","I use this radio mostly for newstalk; especially late at night with earphones so it doesn't bother my spouse. I like the configuration for station presets, and the simple ""sleep timer power-on arrangement"" which makes this radio easy to operate in the dark. Nice backlight when needed too."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Great Product and Price,I use this in my laptop with Microsoft Street with GPS. It works great when you have multiple USB with only one port
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,An after market must have,"This item fills the gap that should have been filled during the test phase of the IPOD stock ear buds.  If you're fed up with the sound changing because of the ear buds sliding out of place or falling completely out of your ears when leaning forward or actually walking, then this item is a godsend.  First the original buds are too large for the average ear canal and are increasingly uncomfortable to wear after more than five minutes.  The different sizes that are available allow for a custom fit, great comfort and to some degree muffle and block ambient noise. Makes listening to portable music a pleasure rather than an endurance contest.  Money well spent.  Lost a pair and loved it enough to purchase it again, and would again.  If only the manufacturer could have spent the effort to include this after market earbud design on the original product.   Everything else feels like a large, hard piece of plastic.   Also bought a set for my son and daughter"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Something more current.,I picked up this item in mid 2002.
electronics,,5.0,Great Product,This hub has worked exactly as anticipated.  I've had it for a month or so now and it is hooked up to my laptop.
electronics,2 of 61,1.0,Printer ships without interface cable!!!!,I can't believe you would ship a printer and the first thing the user guide says is to go out and buy a USB interface cable. Couyldn't you have warned me that I would need a cable? I have never experienced this with any printers I've purchased in the past. UNBELIEVABLE
electronics,10 of 11,1.0,Does not work,"I bought this unit because it had all the features that I was looking for.  However...it took five to ten minutes to find the GPS signal to start working, it gave confusing directions on the highway when I came to divided highways.  The last time I used it, I waited 30 minutes as I was driving to a destination to finally start working, and then it just stopped working completely on our way home.  Fortunately, it all happened within the 30 days return period and I sent it back.  What good are all the features when the unit doesn't even work?"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Item not as pictured,"The keyboard I received looks like the one that came with my G5 (or a wired Apple Pro Wireless), not the G4'ish era one pictured above. This is a good thing"
electronics,,5.0,Great!,"Plugged the cables in and it worked like a charm.  I did speed tests just to be certain that it did not affect my DSL connection speeds, and it did not.  It was nice not having to deal with a crossover cable or flipping a manual switch to configure an uplink port.  Contrary to another review, my unit does not run warm, but mine is not fully loaded transmitting data continuously, but I doubt even that would make a difference"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,BEST I've Ever Seen,"This is the best wireless mouse for notebooks that I've ever seen. I can hiberate my laptop or even completely reboot and the mouse and USB receiver still automatically reconnect when I restart, even after turning the mouse off. I can't even remember the last time I had to manually hit the ""Connect"" buttons on the receiver and mouse to synch them up. The on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse is great for traveling. No more taking the batteries out first! The battery conservation of it amazing too. I've had mine for three months now and have yet to replace the batteries. My previous mouse by Targus wouldn't last a week. The optical nature of it has been a surprise too. I was sceptical at first, but it works great anywhere. In fact, I'm sitting on the couch while typing this and the mouse works fine sitting on the cloth cushion beside me, and without draining the battery in a heartbeat"
electronics,3 of 7,5.0,Quality matters,"These cables WILL significantly outperform cheaper cables, as long as you have equipment good enough to take advantage of their quality.  A system is only as good as the weakest link, and I have a feeling someone who returns a $100 cable and buys a 'DVD player for the same price' has several links in his system that are considerably weaker than these cables.  If you have a $100 DVD player, you shouldn't buy $100 cables.  If you have good equipment and you're looking for cables that will allow your system to show it's potential, these will definitely impress you"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,DOH!!!,"Well, it looks nice, it's small, setup isn't hard, the sound is good, and it has several cute little ringtones. However, this phone has a major design flaw that makes it unusable for me: "
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,Use the Sponge Thingys,Update:  Durability is not as expected.  After a few months of moderate daily use (MP3 player in my shirt pocket) during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail.  Regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and I don't expect these ear-buds to last to the end of the year.  Too bad since they produce nice sound.
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,"Good value at a good price, with a caveat",The price of these discs is pretty cheap over all and the quality definitely on the good to great side.
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Works as described,Cable is long enough for most applications. 
electronics,,4.0,Monster Mouse,"Love this mouse. extremely accurate, well designed and in my opinion it's the best in its class by a long shot. Although the batteries need to be swapped once a day, its a small 10 second (max) inconvenience when you consider the 2 other options (software even alerts you before the battery goes dead). Those 2 other options are to either buy a corded mouse which gets annoying and limits future mobile options OR get a mouse that needs to be in a charging stand every night at the risk of forgetting and having NO use of it for hours. If and WHEN that happens you'll WISH you spent a few extra $'s and got the G7 laser. Also with a permanent chargeable battery, once it no longer holds a charge you'll have to buy a new mouse instead of just getting new battery packs. Having swappable batteries trades off all those long term negative issues for one minor and mindless 5-10 second swap out...to me buying this mouse is a no brainer. (only gave it a 4 stars because it doesnt have a ""forward"" button only a ""back"" button) PS: I have had this mouse for just about a year now. PSS: It has quite a long range as wel"
electronics,,5.0,great product...,"i first bought a monster product equivalent in bestbuy, and it absolutely sucked. after buying this i am very happy i did. It works just how it says it does"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Bose is the best,"No doubt, Bose is the king of sound systems."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,iHome ,"  Im probably one of few people on here who has a positive review for this item! I got this for christmas from my dad. I believe he bought it at best buy. Ive had it for almost ten months and I havent had any problems; it still plays the ipod, the clock still works, the date still works, and everything else still works. You dont even need to change the time; theres a switch on the back that lets you change it from standard time to daylight savings time. I dont know why people are complaining about that and the light; the light isnt THAT bright. If I encounter problems I will write another review but so far everything is perfect"
electronics,,4.0,Palm one WIFI card,"This is an excellent card for connectivity. once the software was loaded, the system rebooted and did an automatic search for available networks. A choice is given which to connect to and then your online."
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,"Great sound, but heavy","All the other reviews on Amazon regarding the sound quality of this headphone are correct, and I don't have anything to add. However, I was surprised at how heavy this thing is -- 21 oz! That's more than twice the weight of the heaviest offering from Sennheiser; three times the weight of Grado SR60; and more than 10 times heavier than PX100. My neck doesn't appreciate prolonged music listening sessions with this headphone"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Work Great on Macintosh,"I bought this mouse two month ago and I love it.  First the install on Macintosh (iBook) was very easy.  The mouse is precise and as not delay on movements.  The battery life is okay, but like any wireless device I will recommend to invest in rechargeable batteries.  I used this mouse all day long and I would just bring your attention that this is a traveling mouse so the ergonomic could be a little small for a all day use.  Although that is exactly what I do because I love it so much.  Highly recommended bluetooth mouse"
electronics,,1.0,Terrible radio.,"At $25, this radio is still highly overpriced.  In a major metropolitan area, with many radio stations, it can barely pick up 3 or 4 on the FM!  AM/TV/Weather picks up zero.  But hey, if you enjoy the sound of static, this is the unit for you!  Headphones don't even get stereo output...come on Sony, it's 2006, stereo should be pretty much a standard today.  Purchased this yesterday and will be returning it ASAP today! "
electronics,,5.0,Perfect for what I wanted.,"I bought this to use for my Dell laptop to bring it inside my backpack to college classes, and so far it has worked great.  It has enough padding to protect the laptop while inside the backpack but fits around it tightly so that I can slip it inside the pack easily.  The only improvement would be if it had a small handle on it for when I'm not carrying it inside my backpack, but I'll just be buying another case for that after I finish school"
electronics,0 of 6,5.0,my hubby likes it,its really good if u really wanna play in your p.c. it works goo
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Product,These tapes are top notch.  Used them on our recent trip to Disneyworld and the quality was excellent
electronics,8 of 10,4.0,"Feature loaded, the size of a deck of cards","This is loaded with every feature you could possibly want. It is a little bigger than a deck of cards. It is incredible how much is being packed into small radios these days. Am reception is acceptable, FM is quite good, and Shortwave is equal to the small, pocket Grundig (Grundig is now owned by Eton). I can't think of another pocket radio with so many features"
electronics,1 of 10,1.0,Vonage is a SCAM,"We started using Vonage in Feb. 2006 and we could never get it to work, their tech support would always tell us to unplug the box and we neede a faster internet connection, finally after 4 months of fighting it we went back to our local provider...then every month we were still getting charged for our Vonage service.  Vonage would tell us that they never received the cancellation calls and that we were still using the service(which was disconnected from our computer) They lie through their teeth and we still haven't resolved the issue.  Do a search on Vonage complaints and you'll see we aren't the only ones"
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,Bluetooth didn't work and software isn't Mac compatible,"When I received my phone, the battery was defective.  I ordered a replacement battery but still could not pair the phone to anything (I have plenty of experience with bluetooth pairing). Top it all off with the fact that the software only works on Windows, my only option to load phonebook entries into this phone would be manual entry. The interface of the flip phone was something out of the 1990s -- kludgy and childish.  The available ring tones are from the same generation.  Aside from the technical problems that I encountered, I thought this was a pretty lousy phone"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,I love it -- clear and constant signal,"I was skeptical about this device, because I had been using an iTrip with my 4GB iPod, which could not hold a signal for more than a few minutes, even when stationary."
electronics,6 of 16,5.0,Great Seller,Item was received fast with a free gift. Seller was easy to deal with and I would definately do business again. Highly recommended seller
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good headset,"I have tried many different headsets from Plantronics and others. The headband always ends up breaking or the headset stops working well. My plantronics just broke since people said they could barely hear me, but my Panasonic is still working. I don't put the headset through the ringer so I have no idea what the problem is. Nobody has any problem hearing me with the headset on. It is comfortable and folds up. Overall a good buy"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Targus does it again,"This is the 3rd Targus product I've bought so far, and it works great, just like the others!  It's small enough to fit in my carrying case, but big enough to sit comfortably on my lap and still have enough surface space to use a mouse on the side.  "
electronics,22 of 23,5.0,I love it,I just had a car charger for my ipod and I wasn't always using my ipod in the car so I bought this charger to plug into an outlet wherever I go. Its great. Small and compact so it packs quickly and easily when I pack up and go. I got it quickly and was happy with it when I got it and am still happy with it
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,"Compact, clear sound, good design","Good:  Lightweight, compact, good design, clear sound, plastic ear buds"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Good Batteries,"I use them for wireless devices and digital cameras, with the Sony charger they are excellent.  Much better than the rechargable Canon batterie"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great printer in one.,"Very happy with my purchase of Pixma MP600.  Good color, scanning, great for printing digi images."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,excellent mouse for the money,I bought this mouse because I previously went thru two other mice before this one and they kept getting gunk in them because my roomate was eating food at my computer desk constantly so I decided to get this optical mouse instead it works great its light and feels nice.  The only thing preventing this from getting five stars was the fact that the scroll wheel is very sensitive to pressure it will go into easy scroll mode and can be a little problem but other than that no problems at all
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Nice Keyboard & Mouse Set - Configuration Tips,"I have typically used Logitech wireless keyboard and mice, but the competing Logitech got some negative reviews so I went with the Microsoft.  I specifically wanted a Bluetooth keyboard to use in conjunction with my Lenovo Thinkpad X60S laptop."
electronics,,4.0,Another wise purchase on my part..,"I've had these all Summer and they are everything I need to enjoy Sims, music and DVDs.. hard to believe the sound and even the quality of the units for this price ($40-50)  "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Get what u paid for,"For under $10 and free shipping you have had more than what you paid. For a budget-concern gamer, this is a must buy. I have had this thing over a month and I like it. It dosn't have any fancy stuff, but as a controller, it has advantage over your keyboard and also prevent several special keys of your keyboard being damaged. That is all what you would expect from an Entry level controller"
electronics,47 of 47,5.0,Best way to listen to music frm headphones,"I have just received my new headphones and man o man what have I been missing out on!! I wanted to get a cheap pair since my iPod ones broke, and then as I was browsing I saw these and the noise reduction really caught my eye. Im glad that I decided to spend a few extra bucks, and even though this isn't expensive, but  headphones are thought to be a simple cheap purchase, its worth to spend money this type of a product."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Phone,I love this phone..I like the fact it as 3 different ring tones...I give it 100%..And you can hear clearly on it..I have it in my bedroom..
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Worth the money,"At first, I have read a lot of different reviews regarding the FM Transmitter until I came upon this iTrip transmitter... I have trusted the reviews and bought it. This product is excellent and worth every penny. "
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,Battery life Sucks big time,"I got this device last week from amazon. I fully charged it for 24hrs and left it on the table, in the evening when I picked it up to record I found that batter is more then 85% drained. I was only able to record 20 minute of recording."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Best Clean power/Surge protector for under $100,"This is a great value for a power cleaner/surge protector under $100. This will clean dirty electricity better than pieces in the hundreds of dollars in other brands, for a better picture and better sound. It also protects against cable spikes with it's coax protection. Not only are the color coded outlets nice to look at, they also help to correctly unplug the home theatre component you were looking for. Try and find something like this with an 1850 Joule rating, that has a lifetime replacement warranty. When your tv blows up from a lightning hit, don't say I didn't warn you. I bought 4 of these for all my tv's!! I recommend these to all"
electronics,,5.0,A real bargain! Very Reliable,"I've had this product for over a year and use it with my Nikon D50. It has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments, example: blowing beach sand, salt water mists, and in high heat and humidity.I bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her Canon SD600. Would buy this brand again"
electronics,,5.0,canon ink,"These name brand tanks are more color accurate than SOME refill inks.  Furthermore, I've had one refill ink permanently clog the tank, and the printer as well, until I performed deep cleanings on the printer with a squirt or two of alcohol.  I've found one aftermarket brand ink refill that seems to flow freely.  To the consumer who doesn't want to experiment in order to save money, I recommend the Canon tanks, as expensive as they are."
electronics,10 of 10,2.0,Finally got rebate,"I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T.  I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email.  I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through!  The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.  However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around.  A very dishonest company if you ask me.  Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,a must have...,if you plan to use the ipod in your car with the belkin tunecast II.  It cut the static down and interference considerably as opposed to using the tunecast II with the batteries only
electronics,8 of 11,2.0,Un-Creative Speakers,"After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy these speakers to go with my Creative MP3 player (Which I LOVE by the way)  I have been VERY disappointed with this product.  The first thing I noticed after opening the box was that this product did not include an AC adapter.  How hard would that have been?  C'Mon, Creative!  So I was forced to use batteries.  I will say that the batteries last for several hours, but when the batteries get to be about half juiced the speakers automatically turn off if the volume is too loud.  VERY frustrating.  I will say that when the batteries are fresh, the speakers sound very good.  This product is a big tease.  Lots of potential, but doesn't quite fit the bill"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Great Sound for Money,"I bought these to replace my Bose TriPorts, which I enjoyed greatly, but which I had virtually destroyed through rough handling. I wanted good-sounding headphones that was not so expensive as to make me upset when, not if, I broke them or wore them out."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,Does not work with multiple laptops,Go check out Creative's discussion forums in their support area and do a search on Toshiba. Myself and many others have Toshiba laptops that these do not work with. I have contacted support with no assistanced given whatsoever. In fact they have told multiple people to go get a powered USB adapter.. this totally defeats the purpose of a laptop camera. I have other Creative webcams that work fine without that hassle on this laptop. It is this model thats sucks. (...
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,Excellent TV at a very reasonable price?,"This TV is a great alternative for the pricy flat screen types. It has a great picture a good size for average room and so far it has worked very well.  Sound quality is great.  It has some menu programming options that needed a little time to configure.  Overall, it is an excellent machine and sufficient for home use unless you are someone who likes to bragg about your toys!"
electronics,12 of 18,5.0,Great picture/sound,"Bought a second one of these cables on Amazon after buying an HD DVR. I had previously purchased one for my DVD player at the local Best Buy, paid quite a bit more for it there."
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Great speed and quality,"The pros - relatively fast, high quality photo printing.  Separate trays for 4x6 and standard paper.  Separate tanks for each ink color.  Nice features available for printing without a computer.  Memory card slots and LCD viewer on the printer."
electronics,,5.0,Camcorder tapes,Only used it for a few days after receiving the camera. Seems to work just fine
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,It;s my baby!,"I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple's part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it."
electronics,,5.0,I5871 Handset Base  w/I5808 Handset-Best Yet,"I have enjoyed the reliability and durability of Vtech phones for years. This model is no exception. Among the nicest addition in their feature set is the ability to review and listen to your messages through the handset, will redial and easily save 7,10, or 11 digit numbers, and page an individual misplaced handset. A rechargeable battery pack(not included)in the base station provides up to 4 hrs of service during power failures. 8 handset max means you'll always have a phone where you need one."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent Headphones,"On a whim I purchased these headphones, looking for something cheap to watch movies with on my computer. I was remarkably impressed. The sound is exceptional, and the bass is beautiful. I am in love with the extra long cable, which i have yet to find in any other headphones. Most extraordinary, however, is the durability. I have had these headphones for two years now, using them on average five hours a week, and have yet to have a problem. Last christmas, i wanted a pair to keep in my suitcase, and i bought some other pair and the ear piece coverings fell off within the first week. These headphones are a class act through and through"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,A simple but effective solution,I tied recording directly from my turntable with no satisfactory result. My turntable has no preamplification. Swithced to recording out of the earphone jack of my main stereo preamp with absolutely wonderful results. Final Vinyl program is simplicity itself. EQ options permit you to overcome a lot of sortcomings of the original vinyl recording. Was able to reproduce such diverse things as Mazel's CSO record of Prokoviev's Romeo and Juliet and my old treasured Stan Kenton recordings with near CD quality. Well worth the cost and simple to use. Highly recommeded
electronics,,4.0,Pleased with my purchase,"We ordered this item and a sony TV with a mounting bracket.  We received all of them on separate days, but all were ahead of schedule and I was able to track them right down to the delivery.  The cable works well and from my understanding is as good as the $80.00 monster cable"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Vibration doesn't works in Mac!,"well, as another reviews, im feeling cool with my new gamepad, but is a shame that after read the instrucctions on the package, i found a note that said: "" vibration feature doesn't works in Mac OSX"""
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,"Impressive, but...","Our office has just purchased the GN 9120, and I find it to be perfect, except for one thing.  However, first the good points:  The sound and tone are wonderful.  I walked a half-block away from our office and still had terrific sound and quality.  The convenience of the hands-free headset is unbeatable.  And the set-up was very, very easy and uncomplicated -- even for me!"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Good choice,I am using these batteries (now they come at 900mAh) for my baby monitor - it takes 3 AAAs.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect Fix,"Our GPS quit working on our long road trip with about 2,000 miles left to navigate.  My husband knows a lot about these systems and figured out pretty quickly that it just needed an external antenna.  I guess it is not unusual for these GPS's to have antenna problems after a while.  We went from store to store looking for an antenna but just did not have any luck and had to use the old fashioned paper map to get ourselves from K.C. to southern Alabama.  Funny how you almost forget how to use those when you have had a GPS.  As soon as we got the antenna from Amazon we were back to finding our way around town.  We call our GPS ""Smarty Pants"".  Had I not had my husband to diagnose the problem I would have assumed the GPS was totalled and had been forced to purchase another one.  This was a quick/inexpensive fix for something that orignally was quite expensive.  I have NO complaints about it whatsoever but it would be nice to have something that mounts flush with the GPS instead of having the long cord.  We just tied the extra cord up so that it doesn't get tangled"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,not bad for the money,serves it purpose and holds ipod securely while in car.  the tricky part is making sure you have a cup holder close to your antenna (not easy with antenna in back of the car
electronics,,5.0,Most Reviews Here  Are Not for This Card,"This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Burlington is the Best!,"I have been using Burlington for my greeting cards for years and with my HP All-In-One have never experienced a jam (knock on wood!).  It reproduces my graphics very well - and though photos are better with photo paper, this card stock does quite well in my opinion! I bought Avery because I was running low on card stock and had some cards to make. I was disappointed in the quality compared to that of Burlington.  Avery is flimsy.  Burlington is still the best"
electronics,,1.0,They pretty much suck.,"I bought these specifically for using on a 7-day cruise.  Had I paid any more than $45, AND if there was anything better out there, I'd be sending them back."

electronics,,4.0,Great DIY shirts!,"These are wonderful! You just print anything you want to transfer and then iron them on. You have your custom shirt under 10 minutes!! The only drawback is that they transfer together with the white background unlike the ones for white fabric (So, remember *not* to flip your image when you print!). So you need to trim the print out carefully not leaving a border. Similarly, if you want to print text, you may want to print them in a backgrund box. Using it is super-easy. Just make sure you are using a 100% cotton fabric, that's all"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Logitech Makes Great Products - V200 Great Mouse,"I have bought many Logitech products for my laptop.  This is a great mouse.  Not much to say about it to, but I have had no problems over the past three months.  It works when I need it and how I want it, so what else can I say.  Trouble free is a good thing, plus the USB port mounts right to the bak of the mouse for easy storage.  Thanks to Logitech for another great product!!"
electronics,5 of 21,5.0,"Sure, why not","While this Apple power adapter way not be anything fancy or elegant by Apple's standards, it is very useful. Aside from its job of powering up your laptop, it has built-in extending arms to wrap your power cord around. This helpful feature reduces clutter"
electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Crappy Sony Sound,"Bought these to replace earlier cheap open air Sennheisers. Earlier phones were much better. Less bass but much better overall. Sold out to false Sony ""perceived"" excellence"
electronics,,5.0,Another winner by Logitech,"Being a multiple buyer of Logitech products, including other cordless keyboards/mice/steering wheels, purchasing the MX 3000 was an easy choice. I chose the 3000 because I am not a massive gamer but it gives me a good balance of features that covers both work and play. Good battery life for both keyboard and mouse, good array of enhanced keys and usuable buttons on the mouse. Highly recommend the system to anyone that is looking for a great cordless keyboard/mouse system!:"
electronics,29 of 30,4.0,Good little clock,I purchased this CD clock radio because I found it difficult to sort through all the mixed reviews on everything else.
electronics,,4.0,Great buy!,"I bought this mini modulator to use with my dvd player that didn't connect to my old TV.  I've watched two dvds on it, and I can tell you it worked perfectly with me.  Easy to set up and at an affordable price, this was a great purchase for me"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Unlike other USB Hubs,"This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,good purchase,"couldn't find a boombox that was lightweight but sounded good and had mp3playback. It is fine, does everything I expected. It gets more useage than my hi priced Bose"
electronics,,5.0,watch out where you plug in your laptop,"The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling.  I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice.  Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger.  If your having problems, I would start with unplugging other things first."
electronics,,4.0,"Not perfect, but I got my money's worth","I got this for $9.99 pre-tax and post rebates at CompUSA. Been using it for about a week and I find that it's a solid product. Your mileage will vary depending on how your laptop is designed and positioned on the cooler. Also, ensure that there is a small gap between the laptop and the cooler for proper air flow. If your laptop doesn't have rubber feet, try using a few coins to raise the laptop up. I haven't tried using this on my lap, but I don't think that's how it's designed for and maybe that's why there are some reviews here that complain about the USB cable failing. For those that have USB ports only on the back of the computer, try rotating your cooler 90 degrees and see how that effective that is. You're still able to position your laptop over the two fans, though depending on your laptop design, your laptop might not be able to cool as well. Btw, I'm using a Compaq Presario V2000 series laptop. Yeah, Compaq sucks, but that's not the point of this review."
electronics,,1.0,bad design,Beware the product warranty only covers 90 DAYS. My one is broken after 5 monthes. Some keys did work first and then LCD could not light up. They set very short warranty in purpose and it is because of bad quality.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A power user,"I have used the H51-M12 Plantronics headset for several years. I am in sales and often wear the headset up to 8 hours a day without any fatigue. It is extremely comfortable, has excellent sound quality and works with 95% of phones.  However, you may want to contact Plantronics to make sure it works with the particular brand and model of phone you will be using"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Panasonic KX-TG5672B 5.8 GHz Cordless/Answering Phone.,"Awesome Phone system With many features. It has everything and does everything and is super easy to set up and use. Great sound/voice quality. The only flaw would be the keypads are not lit for night dialing, That may be a problem for some. Previously had (Panasonic KX-TG5622M) a piece of junk, But this model is a winner."
electronics,,4.0,Good but not Great,"This is a good overall product. There is actually only one flaw, which was that the iPod cannot be charged when in the cradle. Other than that it is fine."

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Travels with my Pocketec. ,"I have been using these drives, the 40GB for data and the 80GB for photos, as a backup for the last two years. I am on an airplane every 2-6 weeks and, as an anthropologist, go to remote villages up bad roads. These two drives never let me down. I am waiting for the next drive (120? 250?) so that I can continue to keep my laptop drive sleek and fast"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A lot of space at a great price,This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Logitech Cordless,"This cordless mouse and keyboard is excellent.  I have owned it for about a month now.  At first I was skeptical of its size as a previous review said people with large hands have troubles.  I am tall with large hands, and I have zero problems with the size.  At first I was a little clumsy with the keys, but I am very comfortable with it now.  Going coedless is the way to go, why did I not do this sooner.  Plus I love the sleek look and size"
electronics,9 of 23,1.0,Grainy images and paper jam nightmare,"If you're looking for grainy images and more paper jams than proper feeds, then this is the printer for you. For every correct paper feed you have, you'll get 2 paper jams. This is especially helpful when you're printing in a hurry or when you're wanting to impress other family members with your new printer. Without fail, you'll have paper jam after paper jam after paper jam. Hope you have lots of hair coz you'll be pulling it all out when you try to print with this color printer"

electronics,7 of 8,1.0,extremely poor quality,This is one of those times when a review can really save the people that come after.  One person can save the rest a great deal of annoyance and hassle.

electronics,3 of 6,4.0,"If it works, it's great","This product is great.  We only had a snag when it was first shipped to us--it couldn't complete the setup.  But after it was replaced, it was great.  The hassle of shipping it back and forth was disappointing and cost more in terms of shipping.  I'd be interested in how many people have to go through this process to receive the product they want"
electronics,,4.0,Excellent purchase ...,"The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. "
electronics,,1.0,LCD breaks if you drop it,"I have 3 handsets.  Two LCD displays are now broken within 4 months since purchase.  Uniden will not cover the screens under warranty.  They were dropped, but not violently.  One fell only from my hand to the table and it still broke."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,The Best Banana Connectors By Far *****,"I've tried a lot of speaker wire connectors over the years, but these are the best by far.  Easy to attach to your speaker wire with no screwdrivers or other tools needed.  I now have them for all of my speaker connections"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Serious noise blocking,These headphones are basically a pair of noise blocking earmuffs with speakers inside.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Truly Plug And Play,"Straight out of the box, this card worked seemlessly with my Inspiron 8100 (four year old laptop) with WinXP without the SP2 package.  I don't know why others had a problem with their installation process, perhaps the SP2 package for WinXP caused the incompatability.  As for me, I've had this card for more than a month now and it has never caused me any problems.  I bought this card specifically for my iPod and it works perfectly.  "
electronics,,5.0,Great value for dual sided disks.,I did a search all over the internet to find good quality dual layer disks and this is the best price I found. They work just as expected. A great deal
electronics,,5.0,"I had good results, at least","I guess I've been luckier than the other reviewers because I've had great luck with this microphone. I have it on my desk and I sit in my chair, sometimes reclining back, mouth a good 2 feet from the microphone. Using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 I get near-perfect accuracy with it - as good or better than any headset-mounted one I've ever used."
electronics,0 of 7,5.0,Excellent Online purchase,I bought a lot of merchandises from Amazon and I give 5 stars to Amazon online service and products
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Just what you need!,"Compact, portable and works with all the popular media cards: cf I/II, sm/mmc, sd/xd and mms/mmsp. I have one at home and one at the office, both you can take anywhere and doesn't take up alot of space. Easy to use, plug & play. Nice cover opens up and keeps the slots clean from dust when closed. The lid opens and acts as a stand for the reader, a nice angle for putting in the cards."
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Very Buggy!,"I just bought one of these and when it works it works well.  However, it keeps crashing the skype application after picking up the phone and hanging up while in VOIP mode.  It seems that the USB driver is unstable and forcing the skype client to crash.  I am currently using D-link driver version 1.16 and skype client version 2.5.0.146"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Best so far,Excellent case. Provides good protection without being bulky. Easy to dock with skin on. Only problem was the little flap at the bottom that's supposed to protect the docking part - I had to cut that off so it didn't get in the way while docking
electronics,,5.0,a great dvd machine,"i bought this and am very satisfied, and the quality of movies come out great on this machine. this is almost as good as the new hd dvd players, without the fancy high price, highly recomended"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,It is what it is,Low end biometrics....   works when it wants to.   I never got it to work as a login device for Windows and my many attempts to use it as a way to save myself from logging into websites didn't prove to be any better than just loggin in using the keyboard.  Save your money and buy another toy to play with..
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,More than I expected,"We were having horrible signal problems in our house with signal quality. After having installed this channels that we were unable to watch before became practically crystal clear.   Worked much better than I ever expected, and would highly recommend it for people that are having signal issues"
electronics,5 of 15,2.0,Do not Need,It may be good item but the C340 I bought works without it.  So it was a waste of money. 
electronics,21 of 21,5.0,Great product delivering good value for people with simple needs,"As the previous reviews had said:  no frills, basic functions, good sound, compact size, clean look, and a reasonable price.  Exactly what I have been looking for for a long time and could not find! "
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Are They Really Worth It?,"The Apple iPod In-Ear Headphones is a little bit more expenisve than the regular iPod headphones, so you may think that the sound quality is better...but that's not the truth.  I was excited to try out these new gadgets after I bought them...but they are not user-friendly... "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Cheap and Functional.,"just as the title describes! I purchased this for a road trip that has yet to take place, but I test drove it the second I got it out of the package. It does what it is supposed to, doesn't do what it isn't supposed to, and cost under ten dollars. I am satisifed with my purchase"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Can't go wrong with it,"My ipod is by far the most favorite gadget/accessory I have ever owned. With the Ipod, I can: Listen to music, read notes/books, listen to books, listen to podcasts, view photos, watch TV shows, Movies, commercials, and with the right accesory listen to the radio. I always am impressed with the sound quality and versatility of the ipod wherever I go and whatever I do. The thing syncs so well with I-tunes on your PC or Mac and is so easy to operate and use for anyone who is willing to take a few minutes to learn. I strongly recommend the ipod or a nano to anyone interested in getting an MP3 player because of its ease of use, sound quality, and features that it provides to you. I give it 5 stars because I do not think an mp3 player should be difficult to operate or use these days and the Ipod works so smoothly with Itunes and is easy to use and listen to. However, I will say that a general distaste still stays with me about all the DRM usage rights battle that still exists between Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the music world in an effort to protect copyrights. I really hope someday in the next few years they can all agree on a file format that will actually allow owners of music to listen to it as many times as they like, on whatever device they may own. But for now, the Ipod works so very well with the i-tunes store and you can convert your WMA non-proected files into MP3 to work in Itunes."
electronics,,4.0,Mini Memory Card,"I bought it to use in a Sony H-2 Digital camera.  It works great, but you do need the adapter to put the memory card in the slot of your computer to edit/send/transfer pictures.  That is not a problem with the card, as it is the size that the camera calls for"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,The right choice,"My product research criteria included flash memory, small size, low price, good battery life and compatibility with multiple recorded book formats (I watned a player for unabridged recorded books). 1G memory is large enough for books. The criticism of the battery cover on other reviews has merit, but if you leave the player in the clip case, the entire housing is protected.  I had no trouble with the software.  "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works great,"I haven't tried any other products to clean my screens, but I know that this product works great."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Remote! Convenient and Easy to Use.,"I received the URC-200 earlier this week and its one of my best purchases ever. I had 6 remotes cluttering my night stand and finally got frustrated enough to try and consolidate everything. This remote has preprogrammed codes as well as a learning function and editing features. This morning I taught it every feature of my Sony CD carousel and Harman Kardon audio/video receiver. I had already programmed the Phillips satellite receiver, Samsung DVD player and Sony TV. It even worked for my minidisc player!"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Great Product , fast delivery - instant solution","I was looking for an innovative product that could quickly and affordably destroy a large number of cd/dvds.  I work for a small business and we have lots of disks to be destroyed on a regular basis.  This was an instant solution and very affordable.  We are so pleased that we plan on making it mandatory to have on everyone's desktop! DON'T HESITATE, BUY IT NOW!!!"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Would not recommend.,"These are ok headphones, however I would recommend headphones without noise canceling.  You pay more for the noise canceling feature and in reality its not very good. Just sounds like static to me. Overall I think the quality of these headphones is less than satisfactory"
electronics,59 of 61,4.0,You do have to buy this with Apple products!!,"Ok, even though i am telling you have to buy this, i gave it 4 stars, and the reason is that with Apple you will need more than 1 year warranty!! Google and you will see how many problems people have with the iPods. I bought my iPod 40gb 4g on July 2004($399,00 + tax), and after 7 or 8 months it began skipping. I thought at first it was a software glitch and overlooked it. Shortly after my warranty expired (1 year) it totally stopped working, i went to the Apple store i had bought it and they told me it is a hardware problem (and they had seen a 'few' with the same problem) and it will cost me $280,00 to fix it. :("

electronics,,5.0,"Great, handy mouse for your portable","USB connected Mouse is my favorite item purchased in last few months.  It is smaller than you'd expect, and the wire is unusually thin!  There is a groove around/above the baseplate so you can wrap the cord around it!  All the wire fits neatly in the groove and the USB plug has a snap on its side, so you can snap the plug to the bottom and toss it in your bag!  Its really neat, and so much better to have a mouse with your portable"

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,This is the best phone that we tested.,"I have simple requirements for a cordless phone, good sound quality and a reasonable user interface.  I had a Sony that was O.K., and recently tried a new Motorola model when that was ready to be replaced.  It had a lot of static in various parts of the house, so returned it and tried the Panasonic.  Only had it a couple weeks, but this phone is fantastic, has better sound than most corded phones and not a hint of static anywhere in the house or even the back yard.  The phone book and caller ID functions are fairly standard, no complaints here.  The rock-solid wireless performance is where this phone really shines"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Worth it,"The adapter works very well.  I spent a long time trying to find a compatible  adapter for my Tivo but none of the available adapters worked.  This one is worth the money and it hasn't caused me a single problem yet.  It gets excellent range, requires no set up, and has a great connection.  Well worth it"
electronics,,4.0,haven't had to use it yet (6 mo after purchase),For the electronics I purchased (a TI calculator) I should not have gotten the replacement plan. TI products have a reliable history of being... reliable. This plan would have been a very good buy if I was buying something that does have a history of producing lemons. it seems a good plan - but not for my purchase
electronics,28 of 28,5.0,"little size, great performance","I use the WS-300M for research interviews. Participants in my research barely notice it is sitting between us, which allows them to feel less constrained as they talk, which used to happen in the old tape-recorder days. The microphone is very sensitive, picking up trailing-off sentences easily, yet background noises are not a problem with this little recorder. Transferring files to my laptop couldn't be easier with the built-in USB feature. My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that there is no ""pause"" feature so stopping the recording results in a new file once the recorder is restarted. I carry the WS-300M with me all the time in my purse as the opportunity for interviewing study participants comes up unexpectedly. Importantly, my transcriptionist has no problems hearing the files made with this recorder, so my data is staying very much intact. This is a great buy."
electronics,,5.0,"You have to pay this much just to get a reliable alarm clock, which this one is.","How good an alarm clock is basically comes down to this: When you set the alarm with the three or four settings you need to do--alarm on/off, radio/CD/annoying noise,volume, and in this case the track you want it to play or if you want it on shuffle or not--does it actually do what you specified the settings to do.  The Sony Dream Machine does, and it features two equally accessible alarms as well so that husband and wife (or husband and husband or wife and wife as the case may be) don't need to argue over how to set the alarm for two morning schedules, along with convenient and easy to understand buttons for the radio presets and cd player controls. "
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Best headphone money can buy,"I got this about a few years ago. I heard this was one of the best headphones. This was true. Very comfortable wearing that I sometimes forgot that I was putting this on my head. The sound is precise, crispy, no coloration to the original sound. Especially recommended for classic and jazz music which has acoustic sound. And if you love movies, this works good for you."
electronics,21 of 28,1.0,Another example of marketing hype...,"...designed to lift money from the wallets of the American public.  If one is to transmit digital signals like those that come from the back of DVD and CD players reliably, 100% shielding is a basic requirement. This cable is not 100% shielded; look for foil in addition to the copper braid. Further, digital signals don't care about super low resitance or impedance.  If the bits get there, the amplitude is incidental once a sufficient level is achieved.  Over a distance of &gt;10feet, big and fat are just to make you feel good about spending $40 on a $5 piece of hardware. *see below for a possible exception to this.  Thirdly, if you don't have balanced electronics, what difference could an unbalanced cable with RCA interconnects make? RCA connectors will never be 75ohm connectors; they will never be balanced.  The arrows are mostly to make you feel good about your purchase.  Usually it simply indicates the company specs that any drains are attatched at the end to which the arrows point.  If you have such a grounding problem as to cause interference in your playback, an RCA will never cure anything. As a feel good genuflection to the audiphile gods, attach all your arrowed interconnects with the arrow pointing the same way.    And lastly, look into VSWR and how the design of this RCA affects it.  The large diameter of this cable and therefore the diameter of it's dielectric might help here, but if you can see the solder job, the chance of unhealthy levels of VSWR is greater in that once the signal reaches this RCA, the differences between the RCA's shielding, and other properties, and the properties of the coaxial cable are sudden and definite.      If you have the money to spend and like to massage your cables as you install them, this company makes some nice looking/feeling stuff. Not surprising in the world of audio--big marketing hype over substance"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,bargain,"Fantastic sound for the price. Have seen them on sale for $40 at CompUsa. Of course, they didn't have any in stock:)  But really a bargain and the sound is not really a compromise, and they have separate bass and treble controls- use them thru a TV headphone jack, or any cheap digital cd player to improve your sound at a cheap price"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,This is all I needed,"I was having problems hooking up my laptop soundcard to my home stereo. There was an annoying hum if the video and computer equipment were hooked up together even on separate rca inputs. I was thinking of getting a new sound card. For a few bucks more, this was a wiser choice. No more wires hanging from my laptop, no more hum when everything is connected."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,I enjoyed our son's ipod collection during our weekend trip,"Recently we drove seven hours each way to a wedding. Our son brought along his ipod with his Monster transmitter. I did not know this product was available. What a great way to play the ipod! We all enjoyed listening to his collection of music. The sound was clear and very good. I don't remember any problems with the sound transmition except brief periods when we went across certain bridges, tunnels and mountain areas; times when one's radio would have difficulty transmitting also. I am definitely buying one of these for my husband for Christmas and for my daughter for her birthday"
electronics,15 of 19,4.0,love these triple As,"u get 4 in this pack than the slightly cheaper 2 pack. and theyre the 900 mah than the standard 800. be aware how many AAA batteries your charger will charge at once. my charger can charge 4 AAs, but only 2 AAAs at the same time. no matter. these batteries work great and are a great price"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,AFFORDABLE HI-END HEADPHONES,"I purchased my first-ever pair of Sennheiser headphones back in March of 1996. They were ""Ovation 560 Mk.II"" headphones which lasted me for a whopping 10 years time! They were the finest, cleanest, most accurate sounding cans I owned up to that time. They gave up the ghost just this past June; the right side went silent. Having seen a glowing review in Stereophile magazine for the HD-580 phones, I decided to order a dream pair of headphones through Amazon for a great price! You must experience these headphones if you truly appreciate hi-end quality! They are super clean, very detailed sounding, and they are very comfortable to wear during extended periods of time. The treble response is oh so clean, the midrange is just right (some may say slightly recessed, I say it's a characteristic of the Sennheiser Sound) and bass response goes down into the teens! You may even find these headphones frustrating because you will hear what you have and what you don't in terms of recording quality. Reference-quality sound, comfortable to wear, great price, and legendary Sennheiser quality! Very highly recommended"
electronics,0 of 5,5.0,Simplify simplify simplify!,Great basic cable. No complaints. AND it doesn't have those annoying rubber covers! (does anyone find those useful? What are they really for?!?
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,good product,"I have been using it for the past 4 month almost every day, and it is really worth every cent. If you are the type of person who use the phone in front of the pc then this is what you exactly need. the good thing that you can use it with any phone regardless of the brand. it turned my cheap phone into a great phone"
electronics,,4.0,Decent unit,Pretty decent unit.  My wifes JBL iPod player sounds better but is an iPod player only.  I bought this for my desk at work and like having the flexibility of the iPod player and AM/FM radio.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great performance for the price!!!,I have two of these cards. No problems and installation went smoothly under Windows XP home.
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Unlike other USB Hubs,"This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,"Padding, padding, padding","The reason I pick this bag was the padding. It was the best kind I saw. My laptop is a 15.4 inch widescreen and it just barely squeezes in, it's a tight fit but worth it for the PADDING (lol). It looks nice, though the little plastic 'no fall' deals look kind of goofy. You can't get much more than laptop (plus accessories-mouse, charger, etc) one school book and folder in there, but that's to be expected. It's got lots of little compartments for pens, pencils and what not, and a cool feature is cup holder that can be folded and zipped up"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The Best Way To Improve Productivity,"I am a photographer as well as a graphic designer and I have no idea how I managed without my tablet. I find myself using it not only when working on assignments but also when I am just checking my email. There is almost no learning curve with the pen, just pick it up and use it. Overall it is definetly worth the money"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,"Incredible, Beautiful....mmmmmm",   Really guys...i'm going to concur with most on here.  Those who complain about there not being enough bass are the same people who listen to music with the base pumped up so much it drowns all other sounds out.
electronics,3 of 11,4.0,Ipod Mini,I was very  pleased with my ipod mini and the only comment I would make is that it is hard to set up at first
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,it just works,"Nice thing about this cordless phone is that you plug it in and it just immediately works perfectly, no hassle, no incomprehensible instructions, no complicated set up.  I didn't even read the manual. ""Plug and play"".  The range is great too, so far as I can tell in this one BR apartment.  The old phone, not a Panasonic, would punk out a little past the bedroom -this phone makes it anywhere with NO degradation in signal.  Order the one with two handsets - you will appreciate the second set.    "
electronics,29 of 32,4.0,Bigger but cheaper,"Recording wise, it is comparable with Griffin or Belkin voice recorders. Its size is a little bit bigger than other brands, but it has a headphone jack, which could be very convenient."

electronics,7 of 9,5.0,Lush ,"My review should end there.  But for those who need to know more, here's my take.  My head-amp is a Musical Fidelity XCan-V3 and I use the Cardas replacement cable.  I also own Sennheiser HD600s, AKG K701s and Beyerdynamic DT880s.  Each has its special qualities, and all are superb.  I listen mainly to classical music, so let's talk concert halls.  The Sennheisers are like a ""warm"" 19th century hall: think Symphony Hall in Boston or the ""old"" (before the 90s refurbishment) Carnegie Hall.  (The AKGs and Beyerdynamic phones are like a 20th century hall and are ""airy"" and exciting.  In fact, the Beyerdynamic phones, to my ears, emphasize sibilants but are otherwise superb. The AKGs ""throw the best soundstage"" and their presentation almost seems as if it is coming from somewhere outside of my head, which is very unusual for a headphone and quite beguiling. If forced to choose, I'd probably narrow it down to the HD650s and the K701s.) As for any differences between the two Sennheisers, I prefer the HD650s.  My HD600s are about 5 years old (I don't think I've put in more than 500 hours with them, though) and they sound slightly ""grainy"" compared to the HD650s.  The HD650s respond to transients faster and are thereofore somewhat clearer and more involving, to my ears.  Again, all of this is very subjective, but I was just listening (through the HD650s) to the new Abbado recording of Mozart's ""Zauberflote"" and I have never heard a celesta sound so beautiful and ethereal.  But be forewarned: No matter what anyone says (and several professional reviewers claim that they are quite comfortable), the HD650s are a far tighter fit than the HD600s. They grasp the sides of my head with some force, but this becomes less acute after a few moments. I can also somewhat alleviate the pressure by pushing outward on the earcups from time to time and by adjusting the rake angle of the earcups so they they are angled more to the back of my head than to the front.  I strongly recommend that you try them on for comfort before buying.  (In contrast, the Beyerdynamic phones are extremely comfortable on my head, even more comfortable than the HD600s, and are just about the most comfortable ""high-end"" phones out there that I have tried, but the sibilant emphasis issue is important to me.)  Remember these are headphones.  First, if you're uncomfortable wearing them, they're likely to stay unused; and second, they may likely sound different to you than they do to me because our ears are shaped differently.  It is very important to listen to headphones before you buy"

electronics,0 of 15,1.0,It's a No Show for 30 days,"Well, I can't give an honest review of this product because I haven't yet received it.

Recieved second one and have been unable to download maps by syncing with computer.  Loaded maps via sd card slot on computer instead.  Recently lost voice prompts and pda will no longer sync with calendar - lost connection.  Garmin tech support has been unresponsive - cricket, cricket.  I am seeking to return for refund and will purchase different brand than Garmin"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome Sound = Bose,"This are excellent speakers, the quality is remarkable.  The only downside is that you do need a computer or MP3 player to listen to them, but they easily beat MANY mini or micro stereos systems, including Sony or even the Apple HiFi!"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Sandblasted and still worked. ,I agree with the previous review. I had these speakers for a year in Kuwait. They worked great.  Sand gets everywhere out there and it still did not bother these speakers.  I  had many people asking where I got them while I was out there. Small enough to take with me almost everywhere.  Loud enough for everyone in the tent to listen. 
electronics,6 of 7,1.0,Piece of Crap,"Lasted me for two months, and then fell apart. The wire came lose very easily after only moderate use. There was so much clatter and noise when i hooked it  up. Use to own a Sony one, which was cheaper and lasted me two years. This is a piece of crap, don't but it"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,What a SURPRISE,I have a 60 GB Ipod and I have tried 4 other products in my car but this one is by far my favorite. None of the accessories that are offered for the Ipod sound 100% and never have static or interference but this one gives you the most options for changing radio stations. Increasing the volume is somewhat confusing but not impossible. Overall this product is the best on the market for those with cigarette lighter adapters in awkward places. You must be careful with adjusting the neck.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Unbeliveable Deal,I found this bag at another store and am almost embarassed by what I paid for it ($36) fantastic product. I am a Road Warrior/Technician and this bag does it all. As long as you do not over stuff it it will perform great. Even at this price I would recommend it
electronics,6 of 6,1.0,THIS PRODUCT SUCKS,"I've had this darn thing for less than three months, and the latch broke yesterday. I'm not hard on it at all (in fact, it was simply sitting on a shelf for one whole month due to a break in classes!). "
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,The best Surge Protector I've Ever bought,"It is worth the $$$$. I hooked up all my electronics to it. The plugs are held extremely tight, and they will not fall out. The picture on my Monitor is less shaky. Also, the cord on it is extremely long, and the plug is almost flat to the wall. It is also a great deal because it comes with labels for the wires, and locking cable ties. I have bought one for my PC, and TV"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Epson papers are the best. Sorry that the shipping is not.,I receive a lot of things that I purchase on line and I have never seen anything packed so poorly.One of the packages had been tossed around so much in this huge box that it was open
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Has a phone surge protector on board,"The advantage of this surge protector-power strip is that there is a 2 outlet phone jack surge protector on board. I actually had a modem blow out due to a surge, and it came through the telephone line. Now I use a tel-surge protector so I don't have to unplug my phone when a storm is brewing. Note that most surge protectors (baring the kind with huge capacitors) cannot protect against lightning hits, but surges from power problems coming over the lines are common, especially in summer, and these devices can help"
electronics,8 of 8,2.0,Hollow-sounding bass; other problems,"The bass sounds very hollow and boomy. The woofer is also too loud compared to the left and right speakers. Since there's no way to adjust the volume of the woofer separately, I ended up not being able to turn the speakers up as much as I wanted to -- the bass would overpower the rest of the sound when I did."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,SENNHEISER RS 130 WIRELESS HEADPHONES,THERE GREAT I LOVE NOT TRIPPING OVER A WIRE. THEY SOUND GREAT TOO. GOOD INVESTMENT IF YOU LIKE PRIVACY AND LIVE IN A APARTMENT. I USE THEM ALOT FOR WATCHING TV AND MUSIC. I AM DISABLED AND OWN SOME 800 MOVIES SO IT MAKES SINCE I WOULD USE THEM TO WATCH TV SOMETIMES I GET A LITTLE INTEFERENCE BUT WITH ANYTHING WIRELESS THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED. OVERALL I WOULD RECCOMMEND THEM.I MIGHT ADD THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD DISTANCE RANGE ON THEM TO ROAM THE HOUSE AND THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. THE RECHARGING IS AS SIMPLE AS JUST HANGING THEM ON THE RECEIVER IT'S GREAT. FRED BILLING
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Thin is IN,"This keyboard/mouse combo is very, very nice. I really like how thin the keyboard is. The tactile response of the keys is very good. It's not too hard and not too soft. And it doesn't have that odd clicky feel either. Also, it seems that all of the newer keyboards have the Home, End, PgUp, PgDown, Del, Ins keys re-arranged vertically now instead of horizontally. It takes a little bit of getting used to. Logitech, Microsoft, and all of the big name keyboard manufacturers are doing this. "
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Burns perfectly; no coasters!,"I am burning these discs on a Sony DRU-810A, and they work flawlessly. Maybe it's the fact that they are on Sony's compatible list for the drive or that they are quality discs, I don't know. But what I do know is that the picture quality that I got from my copy was PERFECT. NO PIXELATION, NO DROPPED FRAMES, and NO PAUSES. A perfect burn."
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,Interference on every frequency,"I bought this based on the 2 reviews already published here. I live in a relatively rural area, but even so I couldn't get a decent signal with this product. It covers a wide range of frequencies and is very easy and convenient to use, but my music came through full of static even on frequenies that are nowhere near those of broadcast radio stations. I ended up returning this piece of junk and buying and installing a car stereo with an aux input--the only reliable way to get MP3 player tunes to play through your car receiver"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Room-filling sound at a hefty price,"I'm not going to lie: these speakers are among the most expensive computer speakers on the market. If money isn't an issue, however, I would highly recommend them. "
electronics,,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I bought this to pair with my Nokia N80. Since this phone plays MP3 and 3GP/MP4 video, I figured it would be nice to go wireless overall(voice, music, video). I finally got it and paired easily enough. This is where it goes bad. The sound quality is crap. Plays only mids and highs no matter how I adjust the equalizer on the N80. Plays in mono, no matter what setting I use. At first I thought maybe the phone is the problem with it only playing mono. So I paired it with my other phone, Nokia 6270. Same result. I also found out that a co worker had a bluetooth headphone for his S.E. W810i. I asked to pair my phone with his Moto 820 headphones. It plays it in stereo. So its not the phone. Its the Jensen headphone. I am now buying the Motorola 820. This was a waste of money. Luckily I did not pay too much. What ticks me off more is that I was stupid enough to buy this piece of crap. Guess the saying is true, that you get what you paid for. I shoulda shelled out the extra $40 to get the Motorola to begin with. "
electronics,11 of 11,4.0,The Closest Thing You Can Get to a Mobile Movie Theater,"After shopping around for a portable DVD player, I bought the Philips PET1002.  Its screen size and quality are unmatched and the features included in such a small package are incredible."
electronics,8 of 9,4.0,Great Tool,I have used my Travel Drive on several occasions and think its the most convient tool for the PC.  I have taken large color presentations to Kinkos to print and they plug it right in and print my files right out.  It couldn't be easier.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good product,"I purchased this to see if I could split my cable 8 ways in my new house without an amplifier.  To my surprise, my cable internet is just as fast, my plasma TV looks as good as ever, I will say that my older TV (27"" Sony) is a little grainy, but all in all it was better than spending the money and time on an amp"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Nice kit.,"For the price, you actually get a good value.  The small leather case is very nice and does a good job of protecting the e200 series.  The only ""bad"" thing that can be said about this kit is that the small case is a little on the thick side, and it makes the already tiny buttons even harder to push.  The screen protector is hard to attach, especially bubble free, but once it's done it completes the protection for the player very well.  The large case is nice if you take it somewhere without using it, otherwise it's too bulky to carry around.  The cloth is also very soft and cleans the player well.  The lanyard, well, it's a lanyard"

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great product for the money,"Sometines I like to listen to music loud (old drummer). These are the first headphones I found that I didn't kill when I listening to my music loud. My original headphones (same set) were physically wearing out (ear and head pads). I found replacement pads, but they cost almost as much as the new headphones. This purchase was a good deal for the money"

electronics,,5.0,Does what it says,IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Value!,"I love this DVD player.  A huge step up from my old one, which was not a progressive scan.  I didn't have too difficult of a time getting used to the controller, which is always a pain when you get a new system.  And the on-screen features are fun.  I like the ability to adjust the position of the subtitles.  I watch movies a lot with them on and it's just nice to have some more freedom with that. "
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Great TV,"Got for $2500 from Electronic express...Great picture..You can switch from from satellite to antenna with one button...Very happy with purchase...After looking at all that was out there, Panasonic plasma had a better picture and was the same price, but heavier, uses more electricity and no tuner...says hdtv now last 14 years..but gas has to escape like my windows which lasted about 5 years...would recommend lcd tv"
electronics,,4.0,Easy set-up on a Mac,"It seems most people having problems setting this up are on Windows machines or Windows/Mac or Windows/Linux networks. I just now set it up for my home Mac network, and it was pretty much a snap. I used the ethernet cable to connect it to my Netgear wifi router, and now all the Macs in the house can talk to it. The most time-consuming part was loading the software/drivers on the machines"
electronics,,5.0,Fantastic,"We purchased this antenna for our new HD set and could not be happier. It was easy to set up and within minutes it pulled in nearly all the available digital stations - in a basement 35 miles outside of Chicago. No need to purchase anything more expensive, this does a great job"
electronics,3 of 7,1.0,No Password to change settings,Purchased the unit and went to play a childrens DVD and it will not play because the ratings setting will not alow it to play.  Attempted to change the ratings setting and was prompted for a password.  Have never setup a password and the manual does not list a factory preset password.  Turns out the ratings setting will not alow ANY DVDs to play.  This is junk!  Do not buy.  How can I unlock this stupid machine

electronics,12 of 12,1.0,"Buyers, beware","Skype 1.2* for Linux is somewhat temperamental, to say the least.

electronics,,1.0,Very stylish but weaker were it matters,"The first iTrip Nano was defective (continually flipped the iPod Nano between play and pause and could only be halted by unplugging the iTrip). Griffin's email tech support was easy to reach and responeded within 24 hrs. After several go-arounds about requiring an original purchase receipt (it was a present!) and describing the symptoms just one more time, they agreed it was defective and should be returned for replacement.  "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Logitec MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse,The mouse is great but has two things that I am not satisfied with.  One is that the scoll button has no resistence to rotation so the screen will bounce back and forth when the button is released.  There should be a bit of ristence to rotation.  The charge maintained on the battery is short.  It needs to have about 3 more hours of time when fully charged.  It runs down after about 4 hours of use
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Caveat Emptor,"I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case.  I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270.  This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it.  I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA.  Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.  My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA"

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Just as it should be...,"Working ok since first connected, not a single issue due to straight or crossover cables, just what I was looking for, have a couple of servers hooked on it and the speed is great. I DO recommend it"
electronics,,4.0,Great product for the price,"Absolutely great sounding speakers for their size and cost.  Great for a room and computer setup.  They get loud but not loud enough for a party or a full movie experience but perfect for a bedroom, apartment or dorm room."
electronics,,1.0,DON'T,"just don't buy this router, i bought it to work with my Xbox 360 because it is dual-band (A and G). Three months after buying it it stopped working for no reason, i trouble-shot the problem and nothing, i called the customer service line and they told me it was a problem with the modem, i had the modem reset and still nothing... linksys makes some good products but their customer support is terrible, just go with a NETGEAR product and save yourself the trouble"
electronics,,5.0,Excellent heaphones at a great price!,"Ive read alot of reviews on the PortaPro line.  I chose the SportaPros because of the portable design, and I like the behind the head feature.  The sound on these are amazing.  Im no audiophile, but the reviews I read online said these are comparable to $150-300 headphones.  KOSS also has a lifetime warranty on them, which is great"
electronics,2 of 7,5.0,Replacement Lamps are available Just GOOOGLE,The LCD based Front Projector are competing well against DLP FP for consumers.
electronics,,4.0,weak hinges,"Probably the best inexpensive case for the z22 but the hinges are weak.  One drop and one side broke.  Too brittle of plastic for its function/use.  Still, I am going to buy another"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Best media player I've ever used,"This is quite simply the best media player I have used. It's extremely user-friendly, has a long battery life, is extremely durable and plays many different file-types (unlike the apple i-pod). And it's cheaper than an ipod people! Get this product, it's amazing and you'll love it just as much as I do"
electronics,,4.0,Quality system,"I don't know much about audio, nor do I have a good basis for comparison. But FWIW, the system works fine and sounds good"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Great HDD-Great Price,"I've been using the Iomega HDD for a couple of months and it works great!, I also own a 180Gb model which I use at the office. Great products at a great price"
electronics,26 of 28,5.0,High Quality,"I've only used these Panasonic DVD-RAM discs for about 2 weeks but the quality is unsurpased. They are flawless and crystal clear for recording TV, erasing, and re-recording. I will purchase nothing but this brand from now on"
electronics,,5.0,Best Bottom!,"This woofer was immediately apparent in my set-up. The powerful bass bottom it produces - the very lowest of lows, showed me very clearly what I have been missing, even with other good surrounding speakers. A little initial adjustment on the woofer itself was of course important to the test- but it's a beauty now, and it pumps deep!! -Futhermore it is positioned corner of room - adding more strength"
electronics,26 of 27,2.0,Too Much for Too Little,"I've had my Bose for about two years. I'm very glad to have received it as a present because, despite some of its fine features, it certainly does not merit the hefty, comparable-to-a-small-home-stereo price tag."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Superb product for wireless networking at home,Got my new dlink gaming router today from amazon.com. I decided to go with this one after reading the reviews on both amazon and cnet.com.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Fits any cup holder,"I had to use one of the adapters included but it works just great, ipod stays in place and it's easy to remove from it"
electronics,,5.0,Satisfied,Excellent customer service. Had a problem with one of the creative web cams.Returning the item was very easy especially printing the return instructions and the return label from the account
electronics,,5.0,great quality for the price,"Of all the DVD disks I've used this summer, Memorex came second to Sony, but at half the price. I use Memorex now because the quality of the recording is very good and the disks are very reliable"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Felt like I was in the spaceship with Luke Skywalker!,"I just bought this for my husband for a holiday gift.  Personally I thought it was ridiculous and couldn't even believe I would buy something called a ""buttkicker"".  Husband was thrilled to get it and installed it very quickly--said it was easy--that very night we watched Star Wars.  WOW--it really works and it felt like I was in the spaceship!!!!  The next day we watched Lilo and Stitch with our 2 small kids--they loved it! It really does give you the being at the movies effect.  My ony regret??? I'm not sure that I will be able to get my husband out of the home theater room!!!!!!! Arrggghhh!!! Serioulsy--I highly recommend"
electronics,,5.0,very usefull gadget!!,"its very helpfull when you manage several SD cards, its faster and very reliable!"
electronics,,4.0,Panasonic KX-TG5200M GigaRange Supreme 5.8 GHz DSS,"Great phone - Great Price. Does not interfere at all with my wireless setup. Only one problem (this is the reason I gave only 4 stars instead of 5), the keyboard and screen light goes off to fast. Also Amazon had a great price.."
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,stay away... recent quality is TERRIBLE,"I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and ""hope"" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters"
electronics,,5.0,100 Pack Memorex DVD+R,Not a coaster in the bunch.  I started using these a year back and have stuck with a winner.  I won't buy anything else.  And a bargain at that too
electronics,2 of 5,5.0,Its an Antec fan,What more can I say.  I bought 4 of these for my case and they are rock solid
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Another Magellan Goes Wrong...,"I bought this just under two years ago for $1,000 and was quite happy with it until a couple of months ago.  It now regularly ""freezes up"" and often can't get a GPS signal for 2 or 3 miles when I start out on a journey.   Yesterday, the sound stopped functioning.  6 months after I purchased it, a screen appearted which stated that the maps in its system were ""more than 12 months old"" and invited me to purchase new ones."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Great DVD player...at least mine is...,"Even with all the nagative feedback about this product, I decided to take chances and bought it. Well, it worked fine for me. It played regular DVD, DVD+R, CD-R, and CD-RW with very good sound and video quality. I do agree on the fact that the remote needs to be aimed properly, but as I am using separate programable remote, that is not an issue for me. Enabling region free feature was a walk in the park. I am more than happy with this player. I would buy some more if I need extra DVD players."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Look Elsewhere,"I think an extended service plan is a good idea for small digital cameras, but get it from the manufacturer. NEW plans are practically useless, and I learned it is going to take eight weeks for a refund"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,As good as any I've used,"I've used these, Energizers, Duracells, etc.  These have worked as well as any, and are often sold by Amazon at a very good price.  Sony also makes a nice charger, the BCG-34HRMF4.  When on sale, with 4 batteries, it's a great deal."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Shipping is how much?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I have had Canon printers for 10 years now, and have always been impressed. Currently I have the i9900. When paired with this ink, it gives fantastic results!"
electronics,16 of 25,4.0,Maybe a little smaller...,This tablet is just great. The only problem is that it's a little to big. When i want the cursor to cross the screen i have to move my entire arm (not only my hand). Maybe 6x8 inches would be the best size
electronics,41 of 41,5.0,Well worth the wait,"Alright, I've been a loyal Amazon customer for 6 years and this the first time I actually felt positive enough about an item to bother reviewing it.  Hopefully, I can save a few people from overanalyzing a $4k+ TV purchase as much as I have.  I spent several months investigating flat screen HDTV's.  Once I finally made the decision to drop $4k+, I was going to go with an earlier Sharp Aquos model that was on sale at a local electronics chain, but was told there would be a newer model out in about a month.  Impatient as I am, I looked into other brands IN MUCH DETAIL, notably Sony,Phillips and Toshiba, but I'm definitely glad I held out.  This TV is phenomenal.  I play a lot of video games and was worried about the burn-in, plasma wasn't even an option."
electronics,,5.0,Review of Panasonic KX-TG520M Handset,This product is excellent. I am able to receive communications from the base unit anywhere in my home from the basement to the second floor. The reception is crisp and unbroken
electronics,0 of 19,1.0,Sony  Headphones for MP3 use,It's a user friendly product with a great sound
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great headset and great price,"I'm glad I found this headset. The reviews were absolutely right! I've talked to several people, and they couldn't tell I was using it"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Awesome Product,"This Mp3 Player is great. I did a lot of research before I bought it, and read a lot of reviews. It basically came down to the Zen Sleek or the IPOD 20gb. I looked at both of them hard and decided to go for the Zen Sleek and it was a great decision. I have owned it for 3 months already and have had no problems. "
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Weak and outdated,"This is Creative's attempt to capitalize on the success of Apple's Ipod Shuffle by producing a flash mp3 player with no display. This is basically the original Nomad MuVo, and two years ago when I reviewed that same product I gave it a great review.  But that was two years ago, and an mp3 player without a display just doesn't cut it today.  If you want a no thrills mp3 player for exercise, buy the original Nomad Muvo, which you can find brand new for about $15. If you're thinking of getting this, go ahead and spend the nominal extra cost to get the Nomad Muvo TX FM, which includes a display for just a few dollars more."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,One task item that does exactly as described.,"Had it working within minutes of opening the box. Scanned and created PDFs of hundreds of pages as fast as expected. This is the perfect item to take your ""important"" papers and archive them digitally"
electronics,,5.0,Great product,I bought this for my laptop and have been very happy with it. I love the compact size. It's so easy to store in my laptop bag. The performance is great
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,Very sad about this...,"The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great value for money,For the cost this is great value for money. Amazon shipping was also very good . all in all Recommended!!
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Does what it is suppose to do.,"Works just fine, stays where I put it"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Good Product,We bought this powered hub for a desktop because some of our devices were not being recognized as USB 2.0 and we finally tracked the problem down to a power issue.
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Worth the money...,"Remembering the saga, 'buying cheap and paying twice', too well, I chanced on the largest Memory Stick Pro Duo available. I have not regretted my decision after using it with my Sony DSC-W100 digital camera."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Second to none,The best USB cable available in the market
electronics,,1.0,Don't Buy This,"After only 3 months the SanDisk Cruzer Micro 2GB died.  Data was lost, could not be read.  Both my desktop and laptop computer wanted to reformat the Cruzer, but when I tried to format, it could not. Flash drive is totally useless. I replaced it with a Kingston Data Traveller and I hope it lasts longer."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Best dvd recorder hands down.,"What more could you ask for? It records on every format out there ie dvd+-r&rw and ram.Record all your favorite shows,turn vhs to dvd,record from any camcorder including dv input.Pause live tv,use progressive scan,easy to use.Great picture quality with auto or manual record speeds.Edit out comercials.One final note,the ram format is so much easier to use.No finalizing,automatically creates chapters/thunbnails,easy to delete any part,create your own chapters,no having to format discs.Anybody that does not like this machine does not know how to use it properly.I work at an audio/video store,and i can tell you that the panasonics never come back and all the others do,and i mean ALL the others.This machine rocks,buy it"
electronics,,1.0,Very Low quality product,"I bought this for 49.99 at an outlet store and feel I got ripped off. The finish is peeling off from day one. At first I thought it was the protective plastic that you are supposed to peel off. The radio reception is much worse than my other Eton. When I press the ""up"" button to change teh station frequency, often the CR player starts."
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"Slim, portable terrific rich sound","I am using this with my non-iPod mp3 player.  I have to say, these are the best portable speakers I have heard.  Don't let the size fool you, they provide a rich full sound with nice bass pick-up.  I recently took these to my parent's house for the holidays and everyone remarked on how great they sounded.  "
electronics,28 of 28,1.0,Fellows is overrated,"It STRUGGLES with ONE SHEET OF PAPER for god sake! Also, buried in the instruction manual is that it can ONLY WORK FOR 5 MINUTES before it needs a rest, POOR BABY!! It's like you are rooting it on, ""Come on 'lil fellow, you can do it!"" But it can't. I don't know if the model I got was defective or if this brand is just junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY"
electronics,13 of 14,2.0,Technically works,"Having received this item as a gift, I decided to do a few tests with it and my ipod video 30gb.  First I ran a movie, medium sound volume, on my ipod alone with it fully charged. It lasted 137 minutes (2 hours, 17 min.). Then I *fully* recharged the ipod and plugged it into the TuneJuice with a brand new 9v. On the same set of movies, it lasted 202 minutes (3 hours, 22 minutes). So you'd get about an hour of extra power. Not bad for the price."
electronics,34 of 34,5.0,Identical to higher priced ripoffs by Monster and the like,"As stated in other reviews, bits are bits. If they get from one system component to another, you're doing just as well with a $9 cable as a $60 one. Monster and other companies are ripping consumers off with gobbledeygook buzzwords designed to obscure the mind and open the pocketbook."
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,"Crappy software, crappy support","I thought I'd take a chance on this cam since- as one other reviewer stated- it SHOULD be compatible with Window XP. I'm running Win XP media center edition on a BRAND NEW Gateway 825 GM. 3400+ cpu, 1GB main memory. Essentially no other software installed and no other peripherals installed. Shouldn't be a problem, right? Wrong!"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Smooth As Glass - But . . .,"The first thing I noticed about this mouse was how smooth it was, and how easily it glided across my desk.  The Teflon pads on this mouse really do take you by surprise with the slickness they provide to even the slightest movement - but there in-lies the first problem for me personally.  So slick is the response, that even the most negligible hand/arm movement results in a positive movement of the mouse.  The slight 'drag' afforded by cheaper devices, actually helps me keep the pointer exactly where I want it, yet with the Diamondback, button clicks on the mouse can force the pointer off target by quite a few pixels.  This may not sound like much, but if you're a serious gamer, or you copy & paste a lot of text, you will soon feel the effect. Copying & Pasting text was particularly difficult, as the release of the left mouse button alone caused a backlash of the mouse position by at least one character, resulting in a re-selection needing to be made."
electronics,,5.0,Very Nice product,"I work with a laptop computer and I have 3 external harddrives to backup my data, other than that I have several USB devices.  I have used all of them at the same time, this hub works perfectly, and it just takes one USB port, I had one before that used two ports but this one uses only one, giving you room for another device."
electronics,2 of 13,2.0,Unnecessarily Complicated,"The Product was in fine working order, but for the purposes of recording speeches, it's too complicated.  It seems like it's trying to be a cheap version of pro-tools, but if you want to do what pro-tools does, rather buy pro-tools.  So, i don't rate the product very high"
electronics,14 of 14,4.0,Excellent mini sytem..,"This is an amazing little system. It's price has dropped considerably. At about 250, it's a good buy. Definitely not a boom box. The speakers are very smooth and mature sounding. Very solid cabinets and subjectively very well made. Comparable to a pair of Paradigm Atoms, a benchmark two way speaker, price considered but with a better fit and finish. The receiver has a nice heft to it which likely reflects quality amplifier components. The tuner is good with a coax output for an antenae. The cd player works as advertised but the lack of mp3 support is a little disappointing. It really should have a dvd drive with either DVD audio, SACD or playback capabilty for both if only to offer a little bit of future proofing. This system could easily replace a lot of larger systems with no reduction in quality of sound. Add a sub (Paradigm PDR-8/PDR-10, HSU STF1...) and you have a world class (cd only!)system that won't disappoint. Yamaha receivers are typically very long lived. This should last for many years."
electronics,7 of 10,1.0,NOT for a work environment,"We need someone to help us on this phone.  Replaced a similar system with the Motorola and i am shocked at the crappy features...looks pretty but I can't find it functional for our office.  Everyone has had problems with the hold feature ...we may just be use to our old system..but this is driving us all crazy.  There is no clear hold button it goes from a conference lcd button to a hold button depending on the 2 line status.  Sounds confusing, but in a busy store it's even worse.     "
electronics,40 of 40,5.0,Indispensable Designer/Artist's Tool,"I have to say that after years and years of greedily drooling at the thought of getting a 9x12 Intuos tablet, I have finally purchased the 9x12 Intuos 3. And it's huge. Not HUGE like thick or heavy, just spacious.  And so far I can't put it down.  Really.  I haven't cleared enough space on the desk.  But then why would I want to?  It doesn't get hot, it's the right size for a lap desk, and I can use it for most of what I do from 9 to 5. Except typing. Anyway here's my take on it:"
electronics,,5.0,***So much capacity for photos AND videos***,"The 1gb holds soooo many pictures and videos!  This is so compact and my pictures are downloaded, quickly!  Buy it, you'll love it"
electronics,,5.0,Excellent,"I've been using a HP inkjet printer for about 7 years now, and I have bought a lot of different cartridges, both new and remanufactured.  There simply is no substitute for a new cartridge, black or color, manufactured by HP.  They work first time every time, give great quality, and hold up longer.  Getting off-market brands and refurbished cartridges simply is not worth the apparent savings, IMO.  I've wasted too much time and money trying to get them to work, having them run dry quickly, mailing defective and even non-fitting cartridges back to sellers, and even having sellers of defective cartridges never make the refund"
electronics,,5.0,Great,"Bought this at Goodguys for about the same price. Whats nice is the sound is so much better and it cuts down on the wire clutter behind my entertainment cabinet. As many are probably wondering, why is it so expensive? For me it was well worth the money. Others might not hear the difference or believe all the Monster cable hype, but for me, there was definately a noticable sound improvement"
electronics,,4.0,Very good product,"This is the first flash drive I have purchased and had to do quite a bit of research before figuring out what I needed -- a way to store and carry files, photos and artwork -- between two houses and two computers.  I wanted to also use it for back-up and security.  The SanDisk flash drive is very easy to use and meets all my needs.  I especially like the facts that the port connection can be withdrawn into the unit to protect it, and the titanium body is very durable.  The only problems I encountered were related to the instructions for use -- they were virtually non-existent and I had to call SanDisk Customer Service which was only moderately helpful. They assume that everyone who buys their product is a techie and knows what he/she is doing so they speak in jargon.  It was quite frustrating.  For example, there are various SanDisk componenents that showed up on ""My Computer"" page and it was unclear to me what each was for.  I would, however, recommend this product without reservation.  I cannot imagine getting anything less than 2GB.  I almost sorry I do not get more"
electronics,,5.0,Great,I am very happy with the bag. It is exactly what I was looking for... and has lots of space.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Handy little tv,"My husband had one of these a while back, but left it in a hotel.  Too much trouble to have it mailed, so I bought another one.  Doesn't get the best reception in every location, but is good for travel or if he feels like relaxing in the yard"
electronics,2 of 10,1.0,Save Your Money,"The phone has the typical confusing, inadequate 100 page manual. Further, the manual has the usual poor index, so it is frustrating trying to find the items you are looking for. Even if a piece of software or electronic divice is full of great functions, it is useless if it takes a long time, or impossible to figure out. I spent a long time trying to figure out some of the functions, and some I was never able to get. My secretary is very frustrated with this phone."
electronics,,5.0,tenny,"this is the best headphone I ever had. very good range, I like that can be worn with the band on top or at the bac"
electronics,1 of 10,1.0,They didn't work.,They will not work in my dvd-r drive. I have a Dell Dimension 8200. I don't know the brand of my DVD-r drive but it wouldn't even read the discs.
electronics,43 of 51,1.0,There has got to be something better.,Don't waste your money on this. It seems the only reason this DVD was made was to feature someone's girlfriend's video. It's nothing more than...if you see an X on the screen your brightness is set too high and the girl in the middle should look good while the one one the right looks pasty. Now your done let's watch a terrible music video.
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,Works great with a Sony burner,I have a Sony DRU-810A Dual Layer burner and I have purchased 4 of these Memorex Disk packages and i have not had a single failure.  It may have something to do with the type of burner you have.  
electronics,,4.0,"Easy Set-up, Works as Advertised","This headset and amplifier unit works very well overall, and set-up was a breeze. Sound quality is good, although I had trouble with echos on an international conference call one time. My only gripe would be that the indicator LEDs are a bit difficult to see under bright office lighting. Sometimes I'm not sure if the headset is engaged when answering a call"
electronics,,4.0,CA-4400 5-Piece 4.1; fact,The reason I order Cyber Acoustic merchandise is not because of the the typical reasons for buying speakers. I do it mainly because the products they have are manufactured better than most others and becouse of the low price. BUT the cyber acoustic company does not use high quality parts; they just make the best deal in the long run.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,I am so pleased!,"The remote that came with the TV had died, so I ordered this replacement.  After putting in the batteries, it worked immediadely with my TV, VCR and DVD.  It even works with Gold Guide!  I will say, though, that all my components are RCA."
electronics,,5.0,"Rock solid ... after you manage to install it, that is","This card brought the end of connection dropouts for me. I regularly have 10-14 wireless networks in range and when my old DLink card started dropping connections every couple of minutes, I had to upgrade. It's been a week since I installed the WMP54G (v 4.1) and it has yet to drop the connection. I can see how in the evenings the speed varies between 36-54Mbps but the connection never gets dropped. "
electronics,17 of 17,5.0,A nice little printer that does all it is advertised,The CP-10 is a great little printer that prints a outstanding quality wallet photo without a hitch.  The difference between bordered and borderless prints is that borderless prints a somewhat zoomed version of what your image display window shows so you may experience &quot;head chopping&quot; unless you learn to frame your shots with a little more border around objects.  You must be very careful when loading paper so as not to touch the printing surface or a finger print will show up in the finished product.  I was surprised at how much detail can be had on a credit card sized photo and find this to be a nice alternative to printing larger more costly images when this size will produce a compact result that serves many purposes.  Portability is the key here and I use this with a powershot S110 so in two pockets you have a complete photo system on the go.  With optional 12 volt auto adapter you can have instant mobile prints.  It does not interface with a PC so you must print direct from digicam making a larger capacity media card a good addition if shooting away from the printer
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,It does what it's supposed to do,I wanted something that was relatively portable with very good sound that I could move around the house with me. This box fits the bill. It's that simple
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent quality cable built to last,I would have to disagree with all those dissing Monster cables for digital use.  There are many aspects to these cables that make them worth the money other than whether they improve your signal or not. 
electronics,,4.0,Excellent product,"I got the Soundsticks to use as a home stereo in a small room. I wasn't expecting superb sound quality and the Soundsticks really suprised me with the full and detailed sound they produce. Overall, the product is great value for money and the space it takes up. My only gripe is that there is no off button on them, so the only way to power off is to unplug them. I'm not sure how much power they use when idle, but not being able to power off is definitely a down side if you're energy conscious. "

electronics,11 of 11,4.0,This case works just fine for the Palm T/X...,"...even if it does have 'Tungsten' embossed on the front.  The leather on the outside is fine cowhide, the seude on the inside helps to keep the T/X from slipping, and the fit to the machine is virtually perfect.  The padding is soft and should aid considerably in protecting the T/X.  I had considered not purchasing this case based on a couple of reviews I'd read, but I went ahaead and purchased it from Amazon.com anyway."

electronics,,5.0,Most comfortable...smoothest gliding mouse I've ever used...,"Bought a 2nd one...This mouse fits my hand perfectly (or vice versa)...it is light enough to be comfortable, but heavy enough not to move by mistake.  It has excellent construction and the first one has lasted more than 3 years...still works great.  I do have a Intellimouse Explorer version 3.0 and bought this B75-00001 Intellimouse because it is the closest looking unit I could find.  I don't think they make it any more...tried the newer units that are for left and right handed people...but they just don't fit the same.

electronics,,5.0,Excellent phones!,"We have four of these units in our house, and they work like a charm.  Never any interference, and the musical ringer is fun.  We love them, but recommend that you keep one corded phone in your home.  These won't work in a power failure"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,A High Quality Surge Protector At a Great Price,"I'm a big fan of Monster Cable products.  Their stereo/home theater cables are the best you can buy.  So buying a Monster Cable surge protector is a smart choice.  It's also reasonably priced (unlike most Monster Cable products) and comes with a great warranty, as described in the product description.  The unit has a quality feel to it, and each outlet is labeled (TV, DVD, etc.).  It also comes with additional labels to wrap around each power cord (if you choose to do so).  I would definitely recommend this product"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Not just for games,"In my line of work I do an awful lot of data entry and when I worked from home, my laptop just wasnt up to the job (lacking a designated numberpad). So I bought the nostromo."

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Piece of junk,"Product was $2.50, shipping was $7.50.  I have a 2004 4Runner w/ CD/tape.  This product works well for about 1 song and then quickly gets grainy, full of static and poor sound quality.  For $10 I thought that I would gamble and hopefully come up a winner.  Keep your $.  The thing is junk.  I don't know why it works for a moment and then doesn't but it's frustrating and fiddling with it while driving is just plain dangerous"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Works great,"Clogged heads are caused by mixing TDK or Sony tapes with any other brand. Their formulation is different. Don't do it.  Use only TDKs or Sonys in your machine or you can mix Panasonic, Maxell, JVC, Fuji, or Canon brands together.  Those brands are all the same formulation."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Works great for middle of the road installations,"My setup: plasma TV, Tivo, VCR, carousel DVD, HD digital cable box, passable all-in-one home theater receiver. This may not be the ""power remote"" for AV snobs needing RF support and other sophisticated stuff, but it works great for me, and it passes the all-important ""babysitter test"" (as long as you show them where the help key is.) I actually created a separate softbutton on the display just for our nanny, who always watches the same show. Programming online via USB is pretty easy, but definitely requires some clicking around to get everything working just right. I had an older Harmony remote and was able to reuse the profile for the most part. Yes, you have to do the driver/software download shuffle, a painfully familiar task for Windows users. I have both Macs and PCs, and can sympathize with the other reviewers crying ""Anti-Mac!"" requiring to use cr-ppy Windows, but fortunately I have an out. The other reviews dinging charge time and other one time setup issues are a little whiny if you ask me, I had this thing humming pretty quickly (yes you have to charge it first, but what doesn't require that these days?)"
electronics,,4.0,"Great sound, but......","This bad boy can really pump out the volume, does not distort and the bass comes through really loud and clean.  However, when I had it playing at my block party (connected to the wall outlet), the ipod froze up on me after about 5 hours.  And I also noticed that I dont get as much battery life on the ipod when I play it independent of the boombox.  So, be cautious with this product"
electronics,1 of 3,2.0,"compare to my sound blaster live, I give 2 star for it",the Digital out can only support 2 speakers. 
electronics,,4.0,Works extremely well,"I brought the headset to narrate an on screen Camtasia video and was pleased with the results. A minor quibble was when I was setting the levels before recording, the volume wouldn't go higher than midway, which could of been a problem with the Camtasia software or my cheapie open source soundcard. But in playback it sounded fine on my machine and on the web when I posted it. In short, I'd recommend a buy"

electronics,5 of 14,1.0,Doesn't work; No support,"I hooked the player to my Infocus X3 DLP projector via the component video cable I already use for an HD tuner and regular DVD player. When I tried playing an ""upconverted"" DVD, it refused to play above low resolution.  Digging into the manual, websites, etc., I found that ONLY the HDMI (digital) interface is guaranteed acceptable for high def play (it involves ""copy protection""). Whether or not you can play any DVD --including HD DVDs-- in HD depends on the settings programmed onto the disk (it appears that most non-HD disks prohibit upconverting)."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Excellent quality,"Easy to use. Registration to base is not the easy place in the cradle, but easy to understand in the directions. Just wish it was more like the handset that came with the base. 2 different ways of using the functions must be learned. But a minor complaint. Will probably get another"

electronics,1 of 1,1.0,DO NOT BUY !!!,"I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works"

electronics,6 of 8,1.0,"Travis, do you own stock? These speakers are really bad.","I bought these on special, and they are just TERRIBLE. Murky sound, things I am so used to hearing in my music are just GONE. Bass is nothing to write home about. The whole sound platform is just muddy. No clarity or precision at all. Especially at low volumes, you'd think you were holding a pillow over the speakers. Unfortunately I can't return these because they were sitting in the box for a month while I was OS"
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,"Low Price, fast write speed",Lots of storage.  One card for a week of fishing photos!  So much storage that I shoot at max res (5 megapixels) with no backup disk or hard drive data dump. I loved the price
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Waste of money,"I bought these headphones in the hopes they'd be similar to the RCA headphones that came with my mp3 player.  They didn't come close.  They have no flexibility, and I was unable to fit them comfortably around my ears.  I ended up buying another set from another brand. "
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Polycom SE-225 ... Simply the best.... worth every penny,"In short, this is the best phone I've used in over 20 years of telecom experience and selling over the phone. The sound quality is the best I have ever had... by far... and I have used everything from Nortel, Lucent, AT&T, Panasonic, Motorola, etc... The speakerphone is flawless in both directions (the receive side is particularly good with richer bass and smooth treble frequencies). "
electronics,,5.0,Very nice Data Switch,"The 5 port switch works great. Unfortunately I needed five ports that I could use. This unit only has 4 ports availible. The fifth port is tied to the dsl modem. If you only need 4 ports, this unit is great"
electronics,,4.0,It does the job,"This stand raises my monitor to the prefect height. I have my 15"" MacBook Pro on a laptop cooler inside the stand. If you use your laptop primarily as a desktop then this set up works well. But if you remove the laptop often, it's kind of a pain plugging in (and unplugging) all the cables (monitor, usb, headphone etc...) when the laptop is inside the stand. If you have the desks pace, it's easier to keep the laptop outside the stand."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Try different outlets if the first doesn't work.,"If you live in a larger home, your home may have been wired in two or more sections.  Half the outlets in the house may be on one circuit (not an electrician, so I don't know the technical term), while the rest of the outlets are on a completely different circuit. As long as both the outlets you are using are on the came circuit, your Slinglink should work well.  This is the same issue with the wireless home intercoms. If you try it in one outlet and it doesn't work, try another outlet, maybe another room"

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Review of Netgear Switch,This switch works very well. There is very little needed to setup.  I just plugged in the wires and power.  There is no software setup needed
electronics,,1.0,"Entertainment Dock great, remote control not so great","Physically, the remote control is not of the same quality as the dock.  It has three buttons at the top and a simulated iPod selection wheel below them that is actually 5 discreet membrane type buttons under a disc.  The range is about 20ft and even close to the dock the buttons ""miss"".  I'm not sure if the problems are purely related to the transmitter/receiver pair or poor quality buttons or both.  It is unfortunate as the base and cabling that came with it are of the same solid durable feel as an iPod.  The remote alone is what dragged my rating down to a 1"
electronics,,5.0,Great performance !,"I bought this PCMCIA network adapter for my two year old Dell Inspiron 600m, which was giving me nightmares for the past three months in trying to connect it to any LAN via ethernet. I tried all kinds of solutions to fix it, ranging from driver updates, card reinstallation and hard disk formatting, but to no avail!"

electronics,5 of 5,1.0,Bought based on great review - very disappointed,"I purchased both the DVD+R and the DVD-R types of the Ridata DVDs.  In both cases, I have experienced about a 33%+ defective rate.  My prior batch of Ritek and Memorex was closed to 3% to 5%."
electronics,,5.0,Great product,"As an architecht I have to do a lot of printigs with hight resolution for presentations purpouses. This paper is excellent for presentations due to his very low price, mat finish, heavy weight and good quality prints. Highly recomemnded"
electronics,,5.0,Just as described!!!,This product has worked very well in my Sony 8.1MP Digital camera.  Nothing has gone wrong after having it used for 3 months now.  Good alternate to Sony's ProDuo memory stick which works with the PSP as well
electronics,,4.0,Great value for money!,The sound from these KLH speakers are very good. The delivery from Amazon.com to the US address was very prompt and on schedule. I have been an Amazon.com customer for the last 7 years and I am more than satisfied with the service received

electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent item.......I highly recommend it!!!,"Hi,"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Great alternative to a laptop replacement battery,"I asked for this for Christmas knowing that I was going on a cross country flight in early January.  Even new, my laptop was never much for battery perfomance.  I could squeeze 3 hours out of the battery provided I ran on low power setting and limited myself to office applications.  Now, I'm down to about an hour of total battery life."
electronics,8 of 12,5.0,Great purchase,"I bought the boom box and the car kit. The FM Modulator has a much better reception than when I have it in the boom box at home.  Unlike others, I have perfect reception with the wrieless modulator..at least for now.  I'm going ahead and buying the home aentenna to get a better reception for when I use the boombox at home."
electronics,2 of 5,4.0,"Great mouse, but right mouse button too easy to click","Overall, I agree with other's reviewer's comment, but so far I have not seen anyone having problem with the right mouse button. I constantly run into situation where the right mouse button is accidentally clicked, which brings up the property menu. In comparing with my Logitech mouse, I can rest both of my fingers on the mouse buttons without ever accidentally click on the button. The traditional mouse has more resistance than the Razer."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great printer,I have a Kodak dock with printer but this Epson is great and so easy to set up and use. My daughter brought hers when she came to visit and after using it I had to buy one. I would buy this one instead of the Kodak (I use both).The quality is much better.You can take it with you and print because you don't need to hook up with a pc. Good job on this one
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Dish Network Deceptive Business Practices,"I have been reading the reviews and have EXACTLY the same problems with my service with DishNetwork.  We won't even get into the customer service b/c that is just plain unconscionable, but my actual service is almost non-existent, I have to ""restart"" my receiver every time I turn on the TV if I want to watch anything other than local channels, sports, movie and HD channels NEVER work!  I have a 942 receiver.  Anyone else have this receiver?  I have reason to believe the company knows it is a defective receiver yet has not recalled it or informed its customers.  If you are having the same problems, email in to let me know. "
electronics,3 of 8,1.0,Does not recognize my sony camcorder,"I purchased this card based on the positive reviews here.  However, my sony camcoder (TRV20) was not detected.  I'm seeking technical support now.  After I get their reply I will update this review.  I use Windows XP pro."
electronics,9 of 10,4.0,"Good hardware, not so good software setup","All right folks, let's not get all gushy and carried away with sentimental joy just yet. The adapter hardware is good and runs as advertised. But the driver needs work. I found the autorun installation program clunky. The developers put a visually classy but functionally clunky proprietary user interface on the autorun install program, and for some reason the ""choice"" buttons are DOA on my XP Professional machine. Cannot even close the autorun install program."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,Works but won't stay connected to network,"Bottom line, don't buy it unless you want to reboot the thing several times a day.  It just will not stay connected to the network more than a few hours at a time.  My other camera (a Panasonic BL-C30A) stays connected non-stop without a problem (but it has no audio).  I'm retuning the Dlink tomorrow. "
electronics,,5.0,Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook Backpack,I love this backpack and it holds so much stuff that I was able to carry my large laptop and all the accessories plus a bunch of books.  I love all the little pockets for organizing things too
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Great sound, but  small Headphones","These are some nice, quality headphones that really do block out background noise. I had my doubts, but they surprised me.  The only drawback I found is that the frame is pretty small. I have a big head, and they have to stretch to fit over it. Large-headed buyers beware"
electronics,22 of 22,5.0,"Excellent Product, Despite the Negative Reviews","To keep things short, and to the point, I'll go ahead and just say what's important about the TransPod.  It's the exact same product as the white TransPod (I'm assuming), under a different color.  The unit itself has a relatively frail-looking build, as if you can crunch it in one hand.  Fortunately, however, this is only skin-deep, and it's a pretty sturdy item.  Granted, I haven't tried to stomp on it to test this durability, but... I'm assuming I'll never have to stomp on it, so we can go ahead and overlook this."
electronics,,5.0,Finally. A great headset without sacrifice,"All I can say is... I bought this headset based on reading positive reviews of it. It did not disappoint me at all. The one thing I have had a lot of trouble finding in a sub $100 headset is good bass. This set has it. And I'm told that my voice is clear on the Mic as well, although I have never listened to myself through it. If anything ever happens to these, I would order another set without even thinking about it. I use these for gaming mostly, but music sounds great through them as well."
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Beautiful prints and easy to use,"This printer was very easy to use.  Just pop in the cartridge, paper, and plug in the camera.  The camera has to be a certain type of Canon, but there is an available computer cable (I have not gotten it yet), to hook up other cameras.  The benefit of using a Canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer, and still print out pictures.  These pictures look beautiful, and the colors are true and bright.  Printing couldn't be easier and fast.  I was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs, press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling.  It's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture.  Instant gratification"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Another GREAT Logitech product,"I upgraded from a Logitech Marble (which still works perfectly after a year, I just wanted to go wireless). This is slightly bigger and has a larger ball. Your hand position is also a little different, which, to me, seemed very akward and uncomfortable at first. However, after about a day, this one became second nature and I couldn't imagine it being any different. I LOVE IT!"
electronics,0 of 2,4.0,Zen Sleek Photo,"Seting up this device took a second try but since then it has worked well and adding songs, outlook and pictures are easy. The battery life isnt what it claims to be and lasts only 8 to 10 hours. Priced lower than an I-Pod, it was worth it"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Sense of security,The building I work in is in kind of a bad area and I step away from my laptop pretty often so feeling secure with it just sitting out was important to me. This lock is easy to use and very sturdy. I don't think it could be easily broken. I recommend this product
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Good Speaker - Great for the Price,"These are great speakers for the price you get them on amazon.com.  I have these paired with an E C35 center, E 250P sub, E N24WII for surround and a Yamaha RX-V767 AV receiver/amp."

electronics,9 of 16,5.0,What a charge!,I purchased these batteries for one of my wife's devices.  She's never been happier!  Maxell might as well just bash that bunny between it's pink ears because they've pulled off the Coup d' etat with the 723448 battery
electronics,1 of 4,5.0, The Flying Sounddock!,"As Air Force One is known as the Flying White House, i've gotta say, the QC2 is the flying sounddock!  I have both the sounddock and the QC2's, and i keep my ipod going continuously, when i'm home, it's playing off the sounddock, when i'm on the go, it's playing through the QC2.  $600 well spent"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Canon Ink Tanks,These tanks work well of course and the Canon printer prints near photo quality images. No complains about the system except for the cost of the 6 tanks needed to run the process; that is why 4/5 stars.  Right now another difficulty lies in finding 1 vendor who carries all 6 colors;  Amazon does not directly so I had to use 3 different vendors to get all 6 tanks.  I'm sure that will change in time.  
electronics,10 of 11,4.0,Works fine with my Legend,"Echoing a previous reviewer: it IS compatible with Garmin's eTrex Legend!!! My only complaint is that the GPS unit seems to sit higher on the dash than necessary when using this mounting device, potentially affecting driver visibility"
electronics,3 of 4,2.0,Just go get the Shure E3,"I had owned Shure E3s, but lost them.  This time I decided to try Etymotic's competing earphones, the ER-4P.  Bad Idea.  Sure, the sound is good, but it's good on the E3s as well.  However, Shure has a number of great ideas that Etymotic missed out on.  Their earphones conform around the ear, not stick out making you look like an idiot.  When wearing the Etymotics I scream ""I'm a fool with wierd headphones, someone mug me for my ipod"".  With the Shure's no one even noticed I had headphones on.  The big difference is excess noise.  The Shure's fit snugly around the back of your head.  When the cable is bumped, the sound travels to the snug point and dies, never reaching your ears.  The Etymotic cables just dangle.  Everytime you turn your head the cables bump your shirt collar, and loud vibrations offend your ear drums."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent value,"You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to show pictures and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. The new 30 and 80 GB models have improved battery life, but I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Wonderful Memory Stick Reader,This is a wonderful multi brand memory stick reader.
electronics,2 of 7,5.0,Incredible accuracy! No external noises at all.,"I am completely blown away. I was afraid to spend this much money on a headphone, but was told that they would improve the sound 100% for my Ipod. The only thing I'm sorry about is I waited this long"
electronics,,5.0,Reliable!,"I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home. "
electronics,23 of 23,5.0,Amazing low power consumption and high speed SD card,"After I used the 1GB PNY SD card to replace the SanDisk 256MB one for my Minolta Dimage Xt camera, I noticed the battery life dropped so much.  At first, I thought it might take more power to write files to a 1GB card so that all SD cards would be the same to my small camera.  Therefore, I gave up the 1GB PNY card.  After my friend told me the low power consumption cards would make the different.  I tried this Transcend 1GB SD card.  It turns out, not only it takes so much less power than the PNY one, but also is the speed so much faster.  It's amazing"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good but screen needs a cover.,"They're good covers, they protected my nano when I dropped it a few times, but the screen gets dirty and dusty easily and it seemed like the cover itself attracted dust. However, the dust is easy to brush off so it is a great product"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Everything I could have asked for,"I had been a fan of Epson printers.  Although they do have a better print head, they are a nightmare with clogging heads and ink consumption.  This Canon prints pictures with the same quality with 10 times less ink.  I love it"
electronics,,5.0,Quality at a budget price.,"I had compared the Kingston with other similiar CompactFlash Cards prior to buying and was impressed by the reviews both on Amazon and offsite.  I recently went to China and took hundreds of pictures with this CompactFlash card.  The storage compacity is fantastic.  I was wondering the quality would be, given I have only used Cannon brands before.  I thought it would take awhile to download the over 400 pics I took, but it transferred under a minute.  The quality was truly impressive, making me reconsider by mind about always buying Cannon brand, as they are so expensive.  Kingston is not only at a budget price, but the quality you demand"
electronics,3 of 7,1.0,Not great build quality,"Had it a couple weeks. Worked fine except that slider didn't lock well. Two weeks in it quit working, would not mount on any one of a half dozen computers. Was very happy to have backed up my data or it would have been gone. Returned for a refund"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good mouse,"Good mouse, battery life is the best part as I've been using it for an entire school semester and haven't changed it once.  Mouse is not very compact, almost the same size as a standard desktop mouse but I like that because it fits my hand.  Mouse is very responsive as I've been able to play games and use day to day applications without any precision problems.  The one con is that the usb attachment which snaps into the bottom of the mouse protrudes slightly from the bottom, there are some other notebook mice where the usb attachment sits flush"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Who really knows until it's too late...,"This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200."
electronics,,5.0,Great buy,I bought this to boost the signal from my 3yr+ old D-link DI-6.14 wireless router from upstairs to downstairs in my home. Very easy to set up and increased my range by more than 100%. Can now recieve strong 
electronics,8 of 8,1.0,This is a piece of junk.,"I've been a skilled tech typist for 50 years, and this typewriter is not only a piece of junk, terrible design, helps you to make more mistakes than you ever could on any other type writer but after 2 months of trying to deal with this ONLY by typing addresses and invoices on it, it stopped working entirely.  But I was warned by a typewriter repair expert who I took my IBM to that they had a ""lot of problems"" with Brother typewriters, and now I thoroughly believe them.  The ribbon setup cartridges, both the multi-strike ribbon and the correction tape is of such rotten design, they don't work well 1/2 the time.  and the keyboard?  It's such a terrible setup no typist, whether they're amateur slow typists, or someone like mke a 120 wpm skilled touch-typist, you cannot type on this, the response is simply not built in for any kind of typist, it's a crazy machine."

electronics,9 of 9,5.0,I'm happy with it,"I bought this TV in December 2005 and it has been working great since. I haven't experienced any problems that were mentioned previously in the reviews and I'm very satisfied.  I use it in my room for DVDs, cable TV, and for my iPod's home dock (where I watch the iPod downloads on the TV) and I can't say I've had a better TV for my needs. I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony). I can't speak directly to the HD issue, but you should do your research if that's a deciding factor for you. HD wasn't really a priority for me, but low cost and quality performance were. I feel that my needs are met with this TV"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Sansa m240 ,"I bought the Sansa M240 two months ago and am quite happy with it. It's light-weight, holds plenty of media (I have yet to fill it up) and the sound is suprisingly good. No complaints"
electronics,5 of 20,1.0,It gets ugly fast,"i don't like how easy it get scratch, and if u get the black one even worst, i went shopping for cases but they get scratch inside the cases too, just by been in the case, i return the case, then i when for those clear stickers and i recomend to put those on on a really clean table and very dry and clean hands may be use glove cause a little touch and there goes your finger print in the sticker, and with a black ipod you can't miss it. and if u don't take your time u will have a lot of air bubbles showing in your ipod, so after a week looks like something that i have for a year, it sucks."
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,great flat panel lcd-tv,"I am a dentist who uses these monitors as tv's for my patients to view while having dental procedure done.  I have been very happy with them.  There is a headphone jack, which I use for patients who don't want to hear the drilling.  I've only had them for about a month, but so far they have been great. "
electronics,7 of 7,1.0,"Cheesy Device, Horrible Support","The device doesn't get recognized under Windows XP SP2 -- like many other reviewers I've seen, I have the same issue -- picked this puppy up at Fry's like many of you too."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,��� Excellent Choice !!!,"The sound is strong & clear. The bass are absolutely fantastic, and if you want to improve them just place the subwoofer 5"" far in front of wall, it's when you say Wow!. Satellites are very small, nicely designed and you won't ever understand how something so SMALL sounds that BIG. Volume level was lower than I expected, but the guilty guy was my Toshiba laptop's sound card, so I had to upgrade it with a cool pcmcia Creative Audigy 2 ZS. Now, that's sound !"
electronics,,4.0,Why I still like this PDA,"I bought this model in 2001 and still use it every day. It is reliable and has lots of software built in. I've added List Pro and Pocket Quicken. The only problems I've had are that the screen has gotten badly scratched, and I can't get the Compact Flash Jacket to read my digital photos"
electronics,,5.0,Financial Calculators,This calculator will do most financial calculations at half the price of the HP-12C.  It is also faster and it corrects a software flaw contained in the HP-12C when calculating for the number of compounding periods
electronics,5 of 7,5.0,It IS better!,"I didn't want to spend the money on this either, but it IS better.  I really don't know why, but it IS. No question about it.  PERFECT picture and sound!  I have a Yamaha RX-V2700 receiver which has HDMI hookups.  I tried a HDMI cable that came with my DirecTV box (from my Toshiba HD DVD player) and it was seriously lacking. This hookup is MUCH better!  I have a Monster Cable HDMI hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my Sony 46"" flat panel as well (more $ but....).  I'm finally satisfied.  I'm watching (and listening to) ""Batman Begins"" (In True HD sound) on HD DVD and it is superb!!!!  This is just awesome!  The stuff of fantasy.  You only have to buy this/these cables once, so why not buy the BEST?!  I highly recommend this move. "

electronics,,5.0,Perfect casual mouse,"Being a touchpad user for so long I decided to give the mouse another try. Using so many different mice in labs around school I knew I wanted something with good tracking. The laser tracking lives up to it's name. I haven't found a surface it won't track on. On top of that, this mouse comes with a list of features. With the software you can program the buttons to perform a wide range of tasks. From internet browsing to window management. Pretty much every feature is customizable. I haven't found a better buy yet. This is a great product"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works Great,"After reading other user reviews, I decided to buy this BT mouse over the other brands. I am very happy that I purchased this one! It lasted 4 days of constant use before needing to be recharged. I am going to get better quality rechargable batteries to put into it, which should increase the time between charges. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Batteries,"I have used Rayovac for around three years, i have never had a problem with leaks.  Energy is very good, I did not notice the difference between Duracell and Rayovac.  I have a shower radio with Rayovac's and I have not changed the batteries since I purchased the radio, which was 6 months ago.  Excellent batteries"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Best financial calculator,"Without a doubt, you cannot get a better calculator. It's very intuitive and easy to use. You just have to remember to hit the clear all button a lot. Other than that, I find it much easier to use, with the menus, than finding buttons on the 12c's. Well worth the extra price"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,This is my second pair.  They are great.,"Like I said above, I am on my second pair of these.  The first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer.  Believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life.  These phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market.  When this pair wears out, I will get some more.  They are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort.  You don't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Exactly same as the description,"This is the best lock you can find for laptops, but I am still not very confident with it. It looks flimpsy but better than others"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Product works great,"Easy to install, works as advertised. I hear a bit of static from time to time and it seems that the dialer function is louder than the voice. Can hear great and no one has complained that they can not hear me. There are cheaper sources for the same device from others. Unfortunately, I did not find those until after the purchase"
electronics,5 of 7,5.0,JVC Headphones,"Comfortable, sound-reducing, easy clean headphone. Dual adapter a nice touch"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Love this keyboard!,"I ordered this keyboard back in 2005 and it's still going strong.  Keys are somewhat firm, properly spaced, and relatively quiet, especially compared to the HP keyboard that originally came with my computer.  I make much less typos with this keyboard than I did with all the others I've had.  All the 'extras' buttons are easy to configure the way you wish, although I admittedly do not use them. LOL  I agree with the other person who stated the zoom slider doesn't really work as well as you might think it should, but like the programmable buttons, I don't really use it anyways.  One of the main features I like is the spacebar- shorter than on most other keyboards, but a little wider.  You'll get used to that very quickly, no worries. :) The spacebar is usually the first thing to mess up on my keyboards, but this one is still just fine.  The wrist support is a bit flimsy and 'wiggly' but definitely functional, properly angled.  The main body of my keyboard is a bit scratched from where it 'wiggles', but that's only a cosmetic thing, doesn't affect the performance of the keyboard itself.  "
electronics,8 of 10,5.0,Amazing Sound Quality,"The technical specifications really don't do these headphones justice. They really sound incredible. The headphones sounded so good that I forgot they even had a microphone, and I admit I didn't use the microphone as much as I thought I would, but the quality was surprisingly adequate for professional voice work. I would strongly recommend these headphones to anyone who wants good quality and occasionally needs a microphone. The long 10 foot cord is a bit long for my needs, but many need the walking space. If you work in a call center...get these. They rock. If you work out of your home...get these. If you do a lot of gaming...get these."
electronics,,5.0,Sennheiser is the best! ,"I bought these about two months ago and they're great! These fit perfectly and I highly recommend these. You will not be hesitant about buying earphones from Sennheiser. U can trust me on this, Sennheiser have the best earbuds in the world."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,excellent,We check most of the CD's after we make a copy and the maxell cds haven't had a problem at all.
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,I love this thing.,I recently bought a new computer and to my dismay the new speakers and subwoofer did not come with a headphone jack. As a result I found myself having to crawl under my desk in order to switch to my headphones. When I came across Koss Y-88 Y Cord splitter I thought... I would give them a try. I am glad to say that they work great. They connect directly to my sound card and the speakers and sub are connected to one of the connector and the headphones to the other. When I want to listen to music or a DVD and not disturb anyone else I just turn off the speakers and put on the headphones. No more crawling to switch them over. It also works great with a stereo or directly connected to your DVD player
electronics,,4.0,Gets the job done,Decent backpack for under $25. Carries my laptop and all my books and notebooks
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,More Rio support for XP users,"This is a durable little MP3 player.  I have had mine for about 4 years and it's still going strong.  I also had the issue of the software not working with XP.  Rio audio products are now owned by Digital Networks, but there is little to no help at all on their website for the Rio 500.  Anyway, that is my only complaint.  There is a great website called Rioworld.org that has several different freeware programs available that will let your Rio 500 work with XP. There is also a couple of recovery files in case you get a gray checkerboard screen (problem that can occur if there is a power failure during upload of a song)"
electronics,26 of 30,4.0,"Good, not great.","Much has been written about what makes the new iPod Nano great, so I won't repeat all of those reviews here. Instead, I'll focus on the flaws that have  slightly marred my experience, though not enough for me to regret my purchase. I'm still glad that I bought it."
electronics,,2.0,URC Review,"The remote works great sometimes.  If I try to surf, often the remote won't go to the next channel after surfing 5-6 channels.  I must wait 4-5 seconds before continuing."
electronics,23 of 24,1.0,Your money is better spent elsewhere,"Like most have pointed out, it's a digital signal and there's no need for all the gas-injected, gold plated, shielded stuff monster cables hype.  For analog signals this stuff absolutely makes a difference because analog cables are highly affected by outside EM interference."
electronics,,4.0,Decent headset,"I will keep this review brief as there are many others.  If you are looking for a headset for the purpose of on-line communication, I think you will be pleased with the value and functionality.  The microphone is very good, and the headset is rather comfortable and light.  However, if you plan on using this headset for gaming or listening to music, I would not recommend it.  This headset is geared toward voice communication.  I would recommend more expensive models/brands if you are looking for an all-in-one solution to communication, gaming, and music listening"
electronics,6 of 27,1.0,Run Away!,"Stay far away from the HP photosmart all-in-ones.  I bought two different models, tried to set them up, scanners wouldn't work, software took 45+ minutes to install, they give you four programs to do the same thing and was on the phone with tech support for hours with no solution.  ""Reboot and re-install"" is all they can do for you.  Got one printing and it literally shot the paper right out onto the floor, no printed paper tray included!  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,GOOD VALUE,"This unit gives clear sound even when very loud. It is neat and sleek. The batteries have a good life and it is very portable. The remote is adequate but it would be nice if it had a nitch for it to reside in; I always lose the things. I put the unit in our car and run audio books off the batteries on trips as my car speakers leave much to be desired. The road vibrations will loosen the iPod but in the house, the iPod seats nicely on its nitch"
electronics,,5.0,Great travel headphones,"I am not an expert on audio equipment.  I do love these headphones.  I have not had any problems with them hurting my head like other people mentioned with Sennheiser headphones.  The audio clarity to me seems excellent.  Even though they don't cover the entire ear I can still listen to my music in noisy areas and not have to crank up the volume.  It takes a few seconds to get it back in the travel case, but it is easy after the first time.  The travel case is very convienient it fits great in my laptop case or pocket for when I am on the go."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,The BEST MP3 player deal out there,"NOTE TO EVERYONE WHOSE SCREEN HAS GONE ""DEAD""!!!!!"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Microphone did not work,The microphone did not work in the unit I was sent.  I guess you get what you pay for...it is not worth the 12 dollars I spent to try and find a way to return these.  Very frustrating
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Holds Tons of Pics,Purchased this when I bought the camera. In a year's time I haven't used all the memory. Have over 400 pictures on it at present. Great purchase for the money. Is easy to install and remove from camera
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,great keyboard,nice keyboard. very silent except oddly for the right shift key and spacebar which makes as much noise as any other keyboard. I'm guessing probably because they are long keys
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Cruzer Titanium is a no brainer,"It is so Convenient and Sturdy: I wear my drive around my neck at work, and it certainly gets its knocks. The expense is nominal considering the quality of the product. I bought the 2G so I have music, photos, documents, schedules, to name a few, on this light weight, thin drive, and I  know that my important documents are near and secure!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Memorex DVD-R 16x 4.7GB 100 Pack Spindle Printable,I really enjoy the prinatable labels on the DVDs.  I find this product is very easy to use and works perfectly.
electronics,,4.0,Great little item for your flash,"If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more."
electronics,,5.0,GOOD PHONE,NO STATIC W/DSL LIKE I HAD W/2.4GHZ UNIDEN. LIKE THE PHONEBOOK FEATURE. VOICE CRYSTAL CLEAR
electronics,,5.0,Everything I expected,"Set this up quickly and easily, and it worked fine right out of the box. Comfy on my ears and head. I can watch a 2 hour movie with no discomfort at all"
electronics,2 of 15,5.0,You really thought you could get a 4GB for $133???,"I saw this item when it was on Amazon for $133 and knew there was an error. Especially with free shipping. You can barely get a 2GB for that price. Like the last person said, ""read the fine print"". I'm sure this product is excellent and deserves 5 stars. If you have issues with Amazon tell them, but don't fault the product"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Glows Brightly,Includes everything that you would expect to have in a great mouse. The bottom edge of the mouse is made with a semi-clear plastic which allows the red colored optical light to shine through and light up the mousepad. The mouse body appears to be made very durable and the buttons press smoothly with an excellent amount of sensitivity.
electronics,6 of 8,4.0,The Jam Studio is underrated,"I'm a computer artist and use the jam studio a bunch. Yes there are driver issues. If you tinker with it some you're fine. The software bundle is useless, but it works with any application. I've tried most tablets, a lot of them make me feel like I'm etching glass. The jam studio has a more natural (not to mention perfect size!) drawing surface than the rest. I even like the corded pen. I don't have to go far when it gets dropped. More pressure levels would be nice but not a must. Hey at this price I would buy two. It's a shame the company went under, this product got written off rather quickly...it's too bad"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Love it...,"I love this one...  Started with a Samsung 32"".  Moved to a Vizio 37"" Now, have this set.  It is like night and day, the higher contrast and brightness.  Dual HDMI inputs, built in tuners. Great football machine, with no ghosting."
electronics,,5.0,SanDisk,"Amazon made it really easy to order , the delivery was on time and there was no problems..."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Inexpensive and works great,"I was able to get this card with a [...] rebate (received the check in just a couple of weeks!) so it was quite cheap for me.  I installed the firewire card & my OS (Windows XP x64) detected it.  The default 64 bit drivers that Windows installed work fine.  I'm using it to capture from my camcorder using WinDV.  Great product, Great price, what more can you ask for"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Best I could find for the price,[...]
electronics,,5.0,"Great sound, and indestructible!","I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass."
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Fastest delivery...one day...I can't believe it!!,I ordered these DVD discs and expected them to be delivered in a couple of days at best...they literally were on my doorstep the following day!  Do they have Santa's elfs working over night?  I can't describe how surprised I was...thanks
electronics,2 of 6,5.0,makes a great difference,bass is much deeper compared to coaxial cable.overall sound quality improved in the HK/Bose hometheater system
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Trouble shooting Aid,Worked as described and expected. A good aid for computer trouble shooting
electronics,,2.0,Good only for the short run,"I received this as a gift, so have no idea where it's from.When it worked, for about the first nine months, it did a good job.  Unfortunately either the battery or charger failed about then.  Coby support VERY slowly said:"
electronics,,2.0,problems connecting with computer,"I too saw that my kingston had problems connecting to my pc and mac. It's pretty much 50/50, on whether the computer will detect it or not. I have to then take it out and plug it back in and then usually it will work. Recently, it died on me, and because It was only about a year old, I figured I probably had a bad item. Whether or not it was shotty workmanship or I just got unlucky, I don't know"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Excellent,I find this product excellent and durable. This product fits my lifestyle very wel
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Pod Tape iPod,"It was a great buy on Amazon. Although the product has been 'pre-owned', it serves the purpose, the quality is great and price is right. The delivery was prompt!-M.J"
electronics,,5.0,Canon Inks very reliable,"I have used Canon genuine inks for my Canon i9900 printer with great results. I have never experienced streaks or clogging of my printer head. I cannot say the same thing for many compatibles. If you have an expensive Canon printer that you want to last, I recommend this ink"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,exceeded my expectations,"After reading some reviews I purchased this case half expecting that I would be returning it.  Not only do I love it, I would have been just as satisfied if I had paid twice as much for it!"
electronics,,5.0,An absolutely marvelous product.,"I've used my 128 MB Cruzer for several months now, with absolutely no problems. It looks great and works great.  Well worth the purchase price. Once you start using a flash drive to backup your important files or photos, you then wonder how you ever survived without one"
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Newcastle WA customer,"I found this to be a sturdy and convenient recharger for those times I don't have access to a USB connection (like in a hotel room). It also charges the unit much faster than the USB does. It is a little bulky, thus the 4 stars. It would be nice if it were smaller"
electronics,,5.0,These DVD's are really good...,These DVD's are really good... I have yet to have any problems..
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great implementation and easy to use,"I have this phone paired with a Plantronics M2500 headset.  The talk quality is great and while the distance is limited to about 10 feet, it is ok for me as long as you can use the belt clip to take the handset along for the ride."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,excellent monitor,"I received this monitor for Christmas and could not have asked for more. I went from a wimpy 14&quot; CRT to this baby, and the differences are unbelievable. The screen is huge, and the colors and brightness are dazzling. The only tip I have is that you MUST use the recommended resolution, otherwise you will run into some problems, like blurry text. Because the screen and resolution are so large, text and things look real small. You might want to tone down the brightness and contrast, and increase text magnification if you're on the Internet or working with documents. It will take some time to get used to, especially if you have been using CRT or a smaller monitor. But by the time you get used to it, it is smooth sailing. Pictures are bright and crisp, and the text is perfect. I had no dead pixels at all. The design of the monitor itself is clean and modern-looking. I am a happy customer"
electronics,3 of 7,4.0,So far so expensive...refill inks????,I love this printer but am a heavy color user and the inks cartridge replacements are killing my pocketbook.
electronics,11 of 11,4.0,Note the native resolution,"I have other Acer monitors and love them all.  This one is bright and clear just like the others.  I did overlook the native resolution of 1400x900.  100% my fault.  Be careful if you want to use its full capabilities.  Many laptops don't go this high.  I bought this to go with a laptop.  My new Toshiba laptop only goes up to 1280x800. I had to back my laptop video down to 1024x768 to show the task bar.  And, of course, everything is larger and there is less on the screen than if it was running at 1400x900.  It appears many higher end desktop pc video cards have 1400x900 as a resolution selection.  I'm mildly disappointed but I probably would have bought it anyway.  An excellent value for the money.  But if you want to use this for tasks where you can fit a maximum amount onto the screen, be sure your pc's video card has 1400x900 resolution as a selection. "
electronics,,4.0,Reasonably priced good product,This is a great PDA and GPS receiver in one. I have been using this for 3 weeks and I love it. The only problem is that it requires a soft reset atleast twice a week (pda crashes). It provides routing and voice prompts. It does provide optimal routing 75% of the time. Overall good product
electronics,,5.0,Wacom Graphire 4 review,"I love this tablet!  I get the functionality of a tablet computer on my little thin Sony.  I almost bought a tablet notebook, but it was so heavy.  I have the best of both worlds now! "
electronics,1 of 19,1.0,Very Unhappy With Your Product,I order two ink cartridges from your company recently for my Epson Sytlus Photo 820 (Black and Color).  Neither one of them have been worth the money spent.  They do not provide ink.  I purchase alot of ink for my printer and was hoping to find a suppler to fulfill my needs but your product flunked big time
electronics,15 of 16,5.0,Performs Perfectly,When I first got it I played it for about one hour a day to see how long the original charge would last. It finally went dead five days later. A short crank of maybe 20 seconds gave it about an hours worth of charge and playing time. A three minute crank and it was back up to playing for four to five hours. I couldn't be happier with it. I get every station that any other radio in my area gets and the built in flashlight is very intense. It's worth every dime I paid.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Works great, even XP x64 support","I have had great experience with this printer.  I even bought a jet direct card for it, and and it works great.  I recently installed XP 64-bit only to find there were no drivers for this printer supported.  However, I used the HP4L driver and it works good enough for my purposes"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Nice printer,"This printer replaced a Canon PIXMA 780 that failed to print black after 13 months.  Although it doesn't print color it works as advertised, all functions have been used, and it's much easier to install then the Canon.  Also nice not to have to replace ink tanks every week.  We'll see if it holds up, it's been installed for almost 3 months"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,great for measuring power usage ON and OFF,"This is a very handy gadget for seeing how much power various appliances are burning.  But don't make one reviewer's mistake, and assume you can calculate yearly power usage by measuring power use only when a device is on, and then multiplying by number of hours a year you have it on.  (His example: TV use 3 hrs a day, so 3 x 365 x watts/hr)"
electronics,,5.0,I've used many headsets - this is the best,"I'm purchased many items on Amazon over the years and have never taken the time to write a review. I feel the pain of all of you who can't believe, like I did, that there aren't good headsets available - but less bad ones. I love this headset.  I've used and tested a number of different headsets and none of them compare for either my hearing clarity or the clarity of the person i'm speaking to.  Nobody can tell I'm on a headset.  I use a headset about 4 hours a day - both in the office and for my cell phone. At first I really didn't care that this one folds up but I find it very useful.  I can put it in my jacket pocket or cargo pants pocket without a problem.  "
electronics,9 of 10,4.0,Definitely where home card makers should start,"While this product comes in more interesting paper types--and heavier card stock--this is clearly the preferred card style for home card makers.  Vastly superior to their quarter-fold counterparts, half-fold cards are  what you'll usually find commercially in card shops.  Though they do fold  to a somewhat larger-than Hallmark (tm) size, the after-folding allignment  is dead-on, and you have more room to express yourself.   If approximating  the look and feel of a 'real' store-bought card is important to you,  therefore, go with this format.  However, I'm partial to more textured  card-stocks--Hewlett Packard makes an excellent 'felt' ivory--so I have to  drop the rating for this one down a star for its white blandness"
electronics,,5.0,perfect for the money.,     A well spending money.
electronics,,2.0,"Uniden TRU9485-3 Expandable Cordless System with Digital Answering System, Dual Keypad, and Call Waiting/Caller ID","I find the design of this product somewhat deficient.  If you hold it too close to your head, you can accidently press the disconnect button with your ear.  This has happened on several occasions.  The message announcement does not say when the call(s) were received.  It announces the number of messages received and the current time.  Shipping was prompt and packaging was very good."
electronics,,1.0,Worst phone ever,"Bad reception, won't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes.  Enough said"
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,a good product,"I have several CH product pieces and love them all.  The only down side I have found is the software that comes with them for calibration isn't very user friendly.  I fly MSFS2004 and had to use a 3rd party software to be able to do what I wanted with the throttles (set beta and reverse ranges, feather detents and fuel c/o) but other than that it's very easy to set up, just plug it in and my computer did the rest.  Couldn't imagine flying my Aeroworx King Air with out it"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,This backpack is great.,"It has room for my 17"" powerbook and actually can fit a second laptop in addition to much other stuff. It's very comfortable to carry - easy on the back compared to others, and relatively well made. Heavy duty zippers give the impression of being able to last a while. Padding is adequate and access is excellent. Cell phone pocket turns out to be a boon too - didn't think I would use it, but it fits my small motorola perfectly. Special prot for audio headphones (you can string them through this) is neat although, my iPod needs to be out to be controlled, so I find the feature of limited use. For the money, and even for double, it's the best laptop backpack I've seen - and I looked at a large number before purchasing"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Good product; ship carefully,"Installed without problem, works perfect so far. I downloaded the latest drivers from the website, instead of using the included CD."
electronics,6 of 13,5.0,Beautiful! A Vision!... an APPLE!,"I have to say, this is a beautiful monitor. I already own a 23"" Apple Flat Panel as well--and have never had any issues with it--I use it on my Dual 2.5 G5 PowerMac."
electronics,9 of 9,1.0,Don't Buy This if You Work Out,"Nice little holder for the Nano, but if you use it while you work out or sweat, forget this one. Mine smells like a high school locker room after a couple of months of use while running. I have tried gently hand washing it to get the odor out, and the clear screen cover came loose when it got wet, plus the material still stinks. This is a waste of money and Apple should be ashamed selling this."

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 - Multi Media Speakers,"Overall, I am satisfied with the sound of the system for the size and price.  The bass reproduction is very good, but I was hoping for a little better performance on the high frequency response.  Rate it 4 out of 5"

electronics,5 of 5,4.0,A Solid Burner,"     I bought this burner for around 40$. I needed to add this for my system, which didnot have the dvd burner part and also needed to backup my information."
electronics,3 of 5,2.0,"Good for photos, bad for general printing needs.","If you're looking exclusively for a photo printer, this is a good choice. It's easy to set up and easy to use. You can print direct from the camera, or from the computer. The printer can tell what kind of paper you're using & adjusts print quality accordingly. On glossy photo paper, the photo prints are excellent."
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Great system,Works well and has many features.  The ease of use makes it great for seniors and non-technical folks.  Pretty intuitive operating system
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Product,"This is a great product.  I had previously purchased a RoadTrip, and had very poor results with it.  The ipod would pop off every time you went over a bump, it made a buzzing feedback noise (conflict with other electronic devices?) and it was a very large bulky device, difficult to hide in the car or carry in your bag.  The Kensington 33159 Auto Charger and FM Transmitter is sooooo much better, much more compact, no feedback noise, and transmits even to channels that do have a signal, though the manual says to use one that has only static.  I've been very pleased with it.  If you're considering the RoadTrip, reconsider and get this one instead"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Great card reader for the price,"This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably."
electronics,,5.0,A great phone!,Even thought the phone does not have an answering attachment I did not need one.  What I wanted was a speaker phone.  This one has a lot of features which I really appreciated.  The speaker phone is on the handset and is a little weak in volume but it is portable so one can take it with you.  I enjoy the music on the multi-tone ring.  At times I have let it ring a little extra long just to hear it.  I did read other reviews and tended to ignore the negative ones and am glad I did.  This has to be be best phone I have ever purchased.  Panasonic is a very good name.

electronics,,4.0,Great Ink Cartridge,"I am very pleased with Epson ink cartridges for my 1280 printer.  Have purshed over a dozen at amazon without any problems so far.  The only thing I dont like is that the Black cartridge is too small, I use a lot of black ink, would like a bigger cartrdige"
electronics,11 of 14,5.0,The Ultimate DJ Earphones,"I am a DJ from Louisville, KY and I recently purchased these when my old headphones gave out, and this is the best investment I have ever made. These have wonderful sound quality and block out ALL ambient noise. I had a monitor blasting nothing but High noise against my head, and I never once noticed it. When I would take off the one earphone it would hurt to hear the monitor, but when I put it back in, nothing but the track I was cueing up."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Indispensible for handling of poor recordings of great performances, among other things","These cans are comfortable, smooth, silky, laid-back, dark, easy on the ears, and easy both on older analog and early digital-glare ridden recordings.  Sure, they kind of fill in some slight gaps and muddy details and are not very neutral for this price range, but it is nice to have one pair of headphones that puts all of the details, good or bad, right in your face and another pair that will make even lesser recordings sound good.  Such a thing is the HD650.  I also have the AKG k701 which is big on detail, to the point that, especially with poor recordings, my ears get fatigued quickly.  Also, some music that's recorded well enough just sounds more flat and lifeless on the k701s, because the HD650s add that extra little bit of lusciousness, without excessive distortion.  With other audiophile headphones, many recordings will sound bad.  With the HD650s, almost all of them will still at least be listenable, even though the better recordings may sound better on other headphones like the k701.  Because of this, they are indispensable.  For those looking for detail, weather or not it will make some recordings nearly unbearable, try k701"

electronics,,5.0,Excellent Quality,"The Sandisk 2GB SD is a high-quality name-brand product. It holds up very well to everyday use. The plastic casing and write-protection button is very solid - not flimsy or cheaply made like some other brands in this price category. In August 2006, I bought two SanDisk 2GB cards (new $30 each) as extra memory for my Palm TX PDA, and they work great for storing pictures, video files, backup data and programs. I also use them every day with a USB adapter for backing up PC files and transferring data to and from home and work. They work flawlessly."
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,The best on the market,"I purchased this a few days ago. I had it in my car the past few days...It has already paid for it self. I am a college student that commutes from New London CT to Warwick RI on I-95 North and South Bound. I can def. say there is a lot of speed traps on that stretch of road. The nice feature of this radar is how it goes off a good two to four miles away. If theres more than one cop in the area shooting his radar it will display his type as well. So you can have two or even three radar readings on the display with strengths of how strong they are (meaning how close you are to them) I think this will be the best $290 I ever spent. It has already paid for it self three times. I love to curise at 75-80 on open stretch of I-95. I mean who doesnt? With this you should not have any fear of them clocking you it does go off well before you will see them in your sight. It almost NEVER goes off for a false readings. The only places where I have noticed in my town is at a Stop and Shop grocery store, it beeps once and goes off, and at our Giant Crystal Mall. Other than that, it only goes off when the cops running it. If you have a lead foot, and have your last warning...Get this radar it will save you. This is the best one on the market, it beats the Escort X50, and any cheap ones by a long shot. (Cobras, etc) "
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,Too dangerous with kids around,"Nice item, but due to the way it hangs on the wall (I am lead to believe this is to help cool it) the weight pulls the top of the plug out the socket enough to expose the top of the electrical pins. I've uploaded a photo. This is not acceptable in a household with children"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,sucks!,Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good Phone,"This phone is an excellant value, and the small size is great to tuck into your pocket.  Reception is clear. The big drawback is the belt-clip....it is so poorly designed as to be useless.  The clip simply does NOT hold the phone in place if you doing anything more than sitting"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Save the Space,"If you have a lot of DVDs or CDs these wallets are the way to go. I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet.  For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em. For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair. Even better here on Amazon.com Enjo"
electronics,,5.0,Good feel and fast navigation,"This optical mouse is the perfect weight in my opinion. The reason I did not select a cordless version was because of the weight issue. The cord if properly placed should be no problem. The side buttons cut back on time in my profession. I do not ask much from a mouse, but I can easily say this is the best mouse I have used"
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Very Convenient Product & Smartly Designed,"This little gem is very compact and has a bigger sound than I was expecting. It is convenient and simple to use. My 9 year old uses it and it is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about it getting broken. The hard case has a flip over cover and it also comes with a soft carrying case. It is great on trips, especially when you don't have a computer with you to charge your Zen. If you are an audiophile, the sound will not be good enough for you, but for the average person, it will exceed expectations"
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE EVER OWNED,"We bought this printer to go with the canon G2 we bought.Excellent choice.First I must say if you are considering buying it from anyone other than Amazon[.com],DON'T.I have dealt with Amazon[.com] for years and they are the best at what they do,no one comes close.The printer is so easy to setup,not like some of are other printers.We are using Window XP,it went like a breeze.in lees than 30 minutes I was printing pictures.... I am still learning all the features,but the quality of the pictuers is as good if not better than any other.. And it is fast fast,printed 2 4x6 pictures in less than 4 minutes,I have found that you do need to buy quality paper.I used the Canon 4x6 bordless paper first until I ran out, then I switched to another brand,big mistake.Use the right paper and you to will be amazed"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Very good quality for the price,"I purchased this printer with the intent to use it for both photo printing and regular text printing. Photos look great and print relatively quickly, but I had a problem with white streaks when printing text. I ended up calling Canon support and they sent me a new printer head for free since the printer is still under warranty. I've had no problems since. I give the printer a high rating mainly because I was very satisified with their tech support"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Definitly worth it if you want the best,"This cable isn't cheap. So why pay so much for it? Why not just buy a cheap s-video cable? Because the quality suffers. They don't just jack up the price for no reason. Gold tipped connecters, more shielding from interference, thicker wire, and better quality materials used provides a better picture. Colors are more vibrant, the whole picture more defined. You get what you pay for, and this Monster Cable is definitly proof of that. I have this cable and it is worth it. Monster all the way"

electronics,0 of 4,5.0,THE BEST EVER!!!,I already bought 3 of these for my friends and they are the BEST in terms of audio/video quality!
electronics,20 of 22,1.0,Useless after 7 months,"This is a great idea, with pretty good software, delivered by a truly awful company."
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Poor design,"Very difficult to lock and unlock--I have to hold my MacBook Pro on edge to get a grip on the lock while I spin the wheels.  Also the mechanism used to set new combinations is a lever that flips very easily.  In locking or unlocking the lock, it is all too easy to inadvertently set a new combination."
electronics,,5.0,great service,"I found the service fast and the product great.  It was a very good price.  Thanks, I will use your service again"
electronics,20 of 20,5.0,Great Pictures,"It took a lot of searching before I decided to purchase a good printer and this one is a great one. The pictures are clear and they print fast. I showed them to friends and didn't tell them that I printed them at home and they were very surprised when I told them. Spend the extra money and get a good printer. This printer also include photo ink, which is really needed for a clean print. Make sure you also get the right paper"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Here's what I think and what you should do...,Straight forward: you should buy this. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works great!,This monitor works great.  The display quality is excellent.  I particularly noticed it being crisper and much brigher than my previous LCD.  Auto-adjust of monitor settings also worked perfectly.  I didn't try the speakers
electronics,,4.0,Targus,I have been pretty happy with my case.  The rolling feature has been a life saver and it is nice to be able to carry some documents in the same case as opposed to both a computer case and a briefcase.  No problems however I have only had it for about 3 months
electronics,,5.0,Kingston SD Card,"This is a high quality product, and can be used in several digital cameras with great results"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Reader compared to Other,This reader (and writer) is absolutely fantastic! I bought this after returning the Biostar 6 in 1 reader from Newe*g. That unit would not read two SmartMedia units I had but the Dazzle knocked it out like a champ. I use it for Compact Flash and SM (4 different brands) and everything works great on the Dazzle. After the rebate the price is hard to beat!
electronics,18 of 18,5.0,Great Deal for a bedroom tv.,"This is not a time-tested review, but my initial tests proved that this a nice TV for the price. The DVD could read a dirty, scratched disc beyond the menu and minutes into the show. There is a VHS ""Rental"" feature to improve the quality of rented videos. The One-touch VCR recording is only controlled from the TV set itself (not the remote). There is no ""Previous Channel"" button on the remote, but you'll be using your cable/satellite remote anyway. Only 50 lbs., less than similar TVs from Insignia, Sylvania, Panasonic and Toshiba. Right out of the box, the black levels looked like they needed a boost, but overall the picture quality is great"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Alternative,"This is a great alternative to the $30 apple ipod charger. I bought an ipod video and was uspet to see that it did not come with a wall charger. I have had no problems with this charger yet, and it works just the same as the other apple chargers. This is a great buy if you do not have a wall charger for your ipod. Great, cheap and reliable"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"As sturdy as it looks, and with very good sound for the price","I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it ""should,"" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort."
electronics,,5.0,A must have for video iPod users,"Brought this on an 11 hour Transatlantic flight and was able to watch 8 hours of movies on the iPod with one set of batteries.  The pack won't fit on your iPod if you have it in a case, but it can function as a kind of ""stand"".  I'm beyond excited about this product.  A must have"
electronics,,4.0,Works for us,I've used this to burn about 3 CDs and my husband has done a couple as well.  We haven't had any problem so far
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,badly remanufactured,"This seemed like a great bargain. It worked adequately for two days, then began various problems. Downloads didn't work, it skipped, etc. "
electronics,7 of 7,1.0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","I adore my nano, but this armband is one of the worst products I have ever bought.  I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout.  The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body.    It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is.  I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,"Mobility and quality, all in one!","Great mobility, sound is very good even though bass sometimes is way too heavy, but overall is an excelent value."
electronics,20 of 29,2.0,BEWARE of Kingston REBATES!,Beware of KINGSTON rebates!
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Everything I Expected Plus,"I recently started getting into listening to mp3 players at work (about 4-6 hours a day) and was looking for a great sounding and very comfortable set of headphones.  After a week or so of reading every review I could find I decided on the Sennheiser HD-595s.  I am by no means an audiophile, I just wanted something that was going to sound great, feel great, and still let me hear the phone if it rings.  These do all that."
electronics,3 of 17,5.0,Made working on the road easy,"although it was alittle to long for me it shouldn't stop other people! worked great, no downfalls"
electronics,,4.0,stylish and compact,"Having owned this carry case for 4 months now, I feel confident to offer this review. The samsonite notebook L35 is stylish and compact. You can pack the notebook, power adapter, a mouse (I like using a separate mouse instead of the mousepad), a couple of 3-subject notebooks for writing, pens, and other small accessories. But that's about it. There's not much wiggle room in this carry case. If you need a more space, don't get this. But if you're looking for a compact carry case that's stylish and clean looking, this is the ticket. My notebook is a Toshiba Tecra A5 and this carry case seems tailor built for it."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Brother Toner Cartridge,"The toner does not last long enough, considering the cost of the cartridge. "
electronics,3 of 6,1.0,terrible. just terrible. ,"I didn't want to buy an ipod because they are so popular, so ubiquitous and seemed overpriced."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works well and fixes itself,"This device is a vast improvement over the cacophony of remotes that I used to use.  The set up of the remote was very simple, the whole process of installing software and programming eight devices took about a half hour.  The device also has a very nice feature where if something is not working correctly, it will self correct via the menu screen.  Some people have complained about software lag with compounding processing threads, but that has been fixed with the most current software.  I have this device set-up to control two TVs, two audio systems, two DVD players, a CD changer and a DVR/Cable box.  It is really a nice feeling to be able to control all of my electronics, anywhere in the house, as long as I have line of sight to the device.  Do not buy the two more expensive models unless you want pretty little icons on your screen.  Save the money and buy some decent speaker wire, you will thank me for that.  Anyway, this device can control everything from a DLP TV to your outdoor stereo system.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed. "
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,It won't inflate my tires??,"When I bought this compresor I thought I would get high quality.  Sharper Image comes very recomended.  In fact I passed over another compressor because of the name.  I've followed the intructions in the manual.  The valve stem won't go far enough into the adapter. And it won't inflate my cars tires.  I've tried it on both mine and my mothers cars.  They both have standard valve stems, so why won't it work?  Well I won't know if mine is defective or not but I'm avoiding Sharper Image products from now on"
electronics,,4.0,Good Sound.  Great Price,"I love these headphones!  They cancel a ton of noise, fit easily in my ear(  I normally hate earbuds!!) and are inexpensive. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,It's a cable,"Yup, it's a cable.  The 400 Mbps is a bit tough for me to verify although it's certainly about six feet, give or take.  The best thing?  Miles cheaper than the rip-off prices of such items in  bricks and mortar stores - which generally make outrageous margins on accessories.  Take that, Circuit City"
electronics,,1.0,For $30 it was over priced,I agree with the comment below.  I was under the assumption as the previous reviewer.  I would pay about $5 with no shipping but no more.  It basically is more cosmetic than productive
electronics,,5.0,Ink Toner 2,The ink toner I received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent value for money!,"I basically bought these because they were cheap. Cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example. The UR-20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies. It has excellent bass and sound isolation. I am by no means an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it and these headphones produce great sound, especially for its price."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Very pleased!,"I have had this hub for 2 months and it's performed like a champ since day one.  It is compact and perfect for my needs - at a good price too.  In my opinion, it's hard to go wrong with a Linksys product.  I would highly recommend this item to anyone"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Griffin Airbase,"I would have given 5 stars but was very annoyed when the cable kept falling out of its attachment. I found a way to twist it around the chrome bit that sticks out the back.However, the signal seems to be so much better as the room my Power Mac G5 is in sits down the hall and around a corner. The airport extreme sits high on a cabinet in the room of the Mac and really didn't work well with itunes giving a signal to my home stereos system, now it is a joy to hear all my itunes so far away uninterrupted. I'm always impressed with Griffin, but disappointed the cable was loose."
electronics,,1.0,Bad QA,"Bought the DWL-G730AP from CompUSA and tried with 3 laptops. None could comunicate with the unit. Exchanged for another, this time I can access the menu after disabled all the firewall (bad practice) but that was how far it could go. It would be great if it works but I am unwilling to try for the 3rd unit. I just stay away from D-Link from now on"
electronics,29 of 32,1.0,Poor reproduction of flesh tones with this cartridge,"I was unhappy with the results with the 'six color' printing that occurs when you swap this cartridge for the no. 94 (black) cartridge. I put this in my machine (HP6210) and printed a test on HP paper. I printed a second picture when a put the no. 94 cartridge back (in effect making it a 'four color' device, which is what you would normally have in the printer). The same picture looked better when printed with the four colors. Most notable were the flesh tones-MUCH more lifelike. I would hold off on spending $24 for one of these, primarily because the result is not worth it, but also because the manner which HP designs the ink set-up. It's kind of a nuisance to have to swap out the black cartridge, because if you forget to put it back, you'll end up with a very high cost-per-page for regular printing of documents"
electronics,,5.0,Sound Blaster X-Fi,"Did an upgrade from my turtle beach card. I'm very impressed with the sound quality, the FPS increase in my games, and the ability to do the EAX models without impacting my FPS. Would highly recommend"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,GREAT Speakers! Good Bass,PROS:
electronics,,5.0,Plenty O' Power,"20 batteries for this price? Who can ask for more...well, maybe free shipping...great and immediate deal"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great- Does its job well!,"I have had this drive for about a week. I wanted it for backup in case Windows crashes and I have to reformat my hard drive. I used the included ""storagesynch"" software once to back up my whole hard drive, which it seemed to do just fine. I also use it to back up my Quicken files each and every time I make a transaction. I keep the drive turned off when not in use, just in case there are overheating issues as mentioned in other reviews. "
electronics,12 of 15,1.0,"Horrible Support, Tricky Set-Up",Linksys products do not seem to work with other Linksys products.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,The perfect mouse,"It's the perfect size-not to big,not to small.I never have a problem with the signal,it's quite responsive.Tracks very well.Works great for my left handed self.I love my shiny red one,it helps me to not misplace it and it's just darn cute.I sent my expensive laser rechargeable cordless back.2 thumbs up"
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,A WORD TO THE WISE....,"Don't be fooled, as I was, into buying this phone set.  I have the Vtech ip5825, which is identical to the ip5850 minus the answering system.  When you initially receive these phones the features will impress you, and it will work too.  Then, after a short period of time (depending on your luck), things begin to run downhill fast.  In my case (see my review on the 5825) the phone would not hang up the line after only 3 months of use.  I had to contact customer service and only because I'm obsessive did I see the thing through in dealing with Vtech support or lack there of.  I'm sure others would have given up early on.  They (Vtech) sure don't make it easy to get them to honor their guarantee.  After all is said and done, my refurbished Vtech phones are going south again.  Now the batteries, as many other Vtech owners have attested to, are failing."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,Not enough battery to be useful,"I am supremely dissapointed in this product. The battery life estimate was changed from 50 hours down to 20 hours between when I ordered it and when it finally shipped. I can't even get near that. I had intended to take the phone with me on the road, but it won't last an eight hour day unless I don't use it at all, and even then ten hours is as much as I can get out of it. I can get barely an hour of talk time, then it's dead. I feel like I have a phone that has to be constantly plugged in, and if that's the case I could tether a usb phone to my laptop for $hundreds less than I spent on this. If I had the opportunity, I would return it."
electronics,,4.0,inexpensive but does the job well,"My wife tried to talk me into getting a more expensive MP3 case, but there was no need to top my $6 purchase of the Rhinoskin. It does the job perfectly; no fancy case with a hinge--and three times the price--needed"

electronics,,4.0,A Good Product Worth Considering if in the MP3 Player Market,"Its true, the 4th generation 30 gig Apple Ipod is a very good product.  Is it great?  Well, maybe not.  But its not that this 4G model does not have every thing that some body wants out of an MP3 player, including video, the ability to hold and show pictures (about 25,000 of them), music (7,500 songs) and a pretty good battery life when listening to music of at least 10-15 hours per charge.  When writing a review of any Ipod I believe that you must mention Apple's Itunes software, which make is very easy to buy and download music to your Ipod, that is why it is the industry leader this in regard.  Also, the body of the Ipod is very slim, the menu of the device is very easy to figure out even if you have never used one before.  Within minutes of turning it on you will be able to understand how to download music, create play lists and arrange your music just the way that you want it.  Whether you like the Apple Ipod or not as an electronic device you have to give Apple credit for the fact that it is very easy to use, all the way around.  "
electronics,22 of 22,5.0,Excellent Hard Drive: Never had any problems.,"I have purchased 6 Lacie D2 Hard Drives over the last 4 years, (3x 160 GB, 1x 200 GB, and 2x 300 GB) and all 6 drives are still working perfectly. The drives are well designed, and dependable. Many of the product reviews I have read on Amazon contradict my experience. "
electronics,14 of 19,1.0,"STAY AWAY -- Disappointing product, worse service","I bought this with the expectation I could carry one power supply for my laptop, phone and PDA. Well, ""fuggedahbatit"" as they say in NY. I've never been able to buy the tips for the phone or PDA even though they are very common models. And when my company upgraded my laptop to a very common (and current) model of Dell, Targus told me that they had discontinued the tip for that Dell! Targus' proposed solution? Buy a brand new power supply. To add insult to injury, the tip compatible with the new power supplies won't charge the laptop, only power it when plugged in."

Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant ""let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel"" navigation ""aid"" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion"
electronics,20 of 20,5.0,Excellent phone with unique features,"I was willing to pay more for the right phone, because I make a lot of telephone calls as a part of my work. I bought the ELBT585 because it was a cordless phone with Bluetooth capability. That's a feature I have been waiting anxiously for!"
electronics,,5.0,UPS works great,This unit set up great. I am using it to backup my DVR and HDTV box. These components wipe out various settings whenever there is the slightest power interruption. This unit has served me well
electronics,0 of 4,2.0,ok,these headphones are ok.  slightly too tight (i do have a big head).  and the sound quality is average.  i do not reccomend them
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,money well spent,I was burned by another company with I bought their product and they didn't offer a replacement plan.  The item died and no one can repair it
electronics,,5.0,What a Surprise!!!,I purchased these speakers based on their looks - really simple and clean with perforated metal covering the speakers instead of the cheap looking cloth that many manufacturers had used on speakers in this price range. I had never heard of this brand but figured all of the computer speakers in this price range probably performed the same. Shortly before I purchased these speakers my Sony boombox had stopped playing CD's so I have been using my computer until I replace it with something new. 
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Sure they're expensive but .......,"Sure, the price is high - there's no doubt about that.  Anyways, being in the electronics industry, I had two thoughts before I wanted to plunk down this much money for cables:"
electronics,,5.0,Good deal for the price,A good card for the price.
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,"Great player for the money, but room for improvement",I have a subscription service (Ruckus) so I didn't want to deal with iPod. I did a lot of research on non-iPod players before buying the sansa. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. 
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Nice case,"I like the case.  Good quality, nice leather outside, nice suede inside.  Looks like I paid more that I did for it.  The additional pockets on the inside are nice.  I put am 8x11 folded piece of paper in the large pocket and have put receipts in the other pockets and it does not compromise the shape or closing of the case.  Fits well in my purse.  Looks nice when taking and using it in meetings.  Slightly cushioned also makes it nice.  Has a small pocket in the center crease for stylus (or additional one if you use the slot on the palm.  I use my for my Palm T/X"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Lexar Good but not Perfect,"Although this is the 3rd Lexar JumpDrive Secure I purchase, I find it still too ""FAT"" for some of the tight spaces given when using hubs.  Also, often there are problems ""hot removing"" the drive when the Secure part of the drive has been mounted.  There are too many ""cannont unmount try later"" errors when trying to remove the drive.  But, I like the ability to Secure as much or as little of the drive as the user needs"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Good Price...very compact,"If you're looking for an inexpensive compact dvd, this one is very good. The only negative is that it gets overheated very quickly so you might have to give it a break between dvd's. Other than that it works very well and was a very good buy"
electronics,3 of 12,5.0,Uhh...,"Why is everyone rating this product a ""1"" just because Amazon screwed up your order??  Your rating has nothing to do with the product itself and makes the product look bad."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Very good, but not fast enough for windows vista readyboost","Im a beta tester for windows vista and bought this to use as a readyboost device. But it does not work for readyboost as it is not fast enough. I bought then an XPORTER Patriot XT 200x which works fine. But, I gave this pendrive to my wife as it is really tine, fast enough for regular use and the cheapest price you can pay. My wife loved it. I think my use is too specific to give this a bad rate"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Fun factor?,"This thing is not a whole lot of fun.  The software is remarkably slow since it is web-based and every click needs to be registered with Logitech.  And there is no way to revert to a previous configuration if you make any changes.  Which is where things get really frustrating.  The remote is capable of controlling pretty much everything IR-based.  But the software really requires a good deal of set up if you are as anal-retentive as I am.  There are a lot of commands that the remote thinks it can do but that it can't actually do.  For a simple example, take another Logitech product, the Z680 speakers.  The software thinks that it can choose a specific input, like ""S/PDIF"" or ""Digital Coaxial"", so it creates buttons for those inputs.  However, the Z-680 control pod only lets you cycle through the possible inputs.  So the buttons that the software creates are meaningless and non-functional.  And that is with another Logitech product.  My Sony TV had 52 buttons created for it.  About 8 actually worked.  So I went through and deleted each button from the configuration.  Each deletion takes several mouse clicks.  Each mouse click takes several seconds.  And then repeat that process for the other 9 devices I wanted to set up.  In the end, I'm very frustrated, but the remote does almost everything I want it to. "
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Easy to use,"I bought this for a school project.  The annual was producing it's own CD, and I needed packaging for it.  These lables worked well, and were reasonably priced.  Be careful when printing, as the side flaps are difficult to align"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,A must have if you own a power strip,"If you use a power strip, you probably have something plugged into it that is so big that it covers more than one outlet.  Buy a few of these and you can free up that space and use all of the outlets on your power strip.  A no brainer, really."
electronics,,5.0,Great Paper,"Works great in my Epson Stylus Photo R340 Printer, looks like pictures you pick up from a film development shop"
electronics,7 of 13,5.0,Home Theatre Enthusiast,"You shouldn't have any doubt in your mind about buying these superb video cables.  They provide the highest quality picture on your tv.  Since there are three cables instead of one, more information, can be sent to the tv with better detail.  These cables have served me very well, and they have really improved the picture quality of my DVD player"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,"Works with Macs, but I'd choose another","I bought this Linksys adapter for an Apple eMac whose ethernet port had been zapped by a lightning strike. The salesperson where I purchased it told me that Linksys offered Macintosh drivers on their web site; this was incorrect. However, because the technology used in all USB-to-Ethernet adapters is based on an industry standard, there are free third-party drivers available for download on the web that will allow your OSX Mac to use just about ANY of the USB-to-ethernet adapters on the market. I downloaded and installed a driver for OSX 10.3.9 from www.sustworks.com/site/news_usb_ethernet.html, and the Linksys USB200M works flawlessly on my eMac."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Excellent WLAN Card,"I purchased this card for my iPaq 3955 running Pocket PC 2003.  The 3955 does not have built-in support for CF cards, but the Socket WLAN card works just fine in my CF expansion pack.  Although the included CD-ROM did not have the updated drivers, they are easily downloaded from Socket's web site.  As soon as I downloaded and installed the software, I was up and running.  I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the connection and how quickly it detected and connected to my WLAN (running off of a Linksys wireless router).  This card truly makes your Pocket PC an Internet-ready mobile handheld device, and best of all it sips power rather than draining the battery like many add-on devices.  Well worth the price and a definite must-have for wireless aficionados"
electronics,8 of 14,5.0,ipod Car 3-in-1,"This is an ideal addition if you have an iPod.  Not onlt does it allow you to broadcast your playlists over your radio, but it also charges your iPod, making it convenient to travel and not need to remember an adapter every time.  If you despise public radio as much as I do, this is a must for listening pleasure"
electronics,,5.0,Extremely happy!!!,"This product was a corporate gift and the recepient loves the gift. I selected this product based on the recommendation of from other reviews. The product is easy to use, holds nearly 200 songs and great for exercising or use in the car."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,nice rack,It was easy to assemble and matches another one that I bought from the same company a few years ago
electronics,2 of 15,1.0,Pesima calidad,"Recibi el estuche apenas hace 15 dias y esta descocido por los costados de la tapa. Para ser un producto de HP, deja mucho que desear."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,This is a great set,	We've been quite happy with this set.  People who come in to watch sports in High-Definition comment that it's like looking through a window at a stadium luxury seat.
electronics,,5.0,Good Wheel,This wheel does the job.  It's not super fancy but you still get the driving experience. Enjoy
electronics,,5.0,Marble mouse,I have used several of these and find them excellent. I have used them with a laptop (winxp) desktop (win xp) and I-Mac OS 10 they work perfectly on all of the machines
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,good product; keeps wires out of the way; compact for storage. ,good product; keeps wires out of the way; compact for easy storage.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,What more could you possibly want?," I was searching for headphones with ""in-line volume control"" and wound up here at Amazon.  After seeing the reviews on these, I knew I wanted to give them a try."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Little Radio,"Hard to believe how good this little beauty is!  Never tried the supplied ear buds, but sound is super though Sony MDR-V150 earmuff-style headphones.  The automatic shutoff is a nice battery saving feature, although I have two complete college football games and two trips to the gym on the first battery (probably about 11 hours), and it's still going stong.  If you are looking for a vary small, but highly functional radio, this is it"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Best Splitter on the Market,"I am using three of the Monster 2GHz splitters where the first (1:3) splitter input is connected to a Motorola Signal Booster (15 dB low noise amp) output.  Two of the three splitter outputs are connected into Monster 2GHz 1:4 splitters, for a total of 8 outputs for cable runs to various locations throughout the house.  The 3rd output (of the first 1:3 splitter) is reserved for the new Verizon FiOS TV data interface, i.e., a Motorola Network Interface Module 100 (aka NIM 100) providing data communications via the MoCA (Multimedia Over Coax Alliance) standard interface which communicates with the Motorola Set Top Boxes.  Since the MoCA standard uses the higher frequencies, from 900MHz-1.5GHz, it is ideal to use the 2GHz bandwidth splitters, to ensure low loss for data transmission across all splitters and cable runs.  Also, the Monster splitters pass the signals in the reverse direction, so these work well with Cable Modems, which operate at the lower end of the bandwidth.  Bottom line, the Monster 2GHz splitters are the best on the market."
electronics,5 of 7,5.0,Excelent !  buy it only if you have XP Professional,The only issue is that it doesn't work with Windows XP home edition.  Otherwise   Is an excelent storage device. Or if you are a Master computer freak yull have to configure your machine to recognized the external hard drive. Buy it it worth it 
electronics,18 of 18,1.0,"Good product, forget about service","Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Outstandingly dependable,"I have used two spindles of these CDrs, and the quality is astonishing. WELL worth the price. I've only lost a few CDrs, and that was because my burner & software is so old. You can burn these at any speed, and a portable player will stay locked onto any track. Highly recommended"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent well worth the money (as are the Etymotic E4p),"I have been using audiophile In Ear Monitors such as these for 5 years (or whenever Apple started making the IPod). I started with the Etymotic E6s, E6Ss then 2 years ago the E4Ps, recently I purchased these Shures and have been extremely pleased with them. Sound wise they are slightly (not much) better that the E4Ps, the bass is more extended and the mids more fluid. Both capture detail you most certainly won't hear with the standard 'phones given with MP3 players, and that's not just Apple!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,No problem.,I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption. 
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Excellent Value and Performance,Netgear has the market cornered for cheap and reliable performance.  I've been using this hub in my apartment for 4 years now without a single hitch
electronics,3 of 7,5.0,"If you have Windows Media Center,  just buy this remote!","Since there are hundreds of other Universal remotes out there that are not designed for Windows MCE, the real question is ""How well does this one control the Windows Media Center experience?"" "
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,I LOVE IT,"I disagree with the other review. And I know for a fact that it does not scratch up the sides. IT IS A GOOD IDEA, AND A GOOD EXECUTION"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Garmin GPS 60csx ,"This is my third Garmin GPS, they always get it right. Being able to down load LARGE areas of both Topo and Street maps is a great utility. I recently used the street map to find my way through SJ Ca. It was extremely helpful. I use the Topo section All the time for keeping track of my position in the woods either GEO caching or hunting. Worth every $$"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Looks Cool, has some WinXP Driver Problems","Although the PowerMate looks cool, it was designed for equally-cool  Apple computers. There are some driver problems in WinXP where the PowerMate works only intermittently--it will randomly stop responding, and will only resume operation if the USB cable is unplugged/replugged. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great upscaling player for the price,Pros:
electronics,30 of 34,1.0,100% waste of money,"I couldn't get them to fix a cracked screen just 2 months after purchase.  No pressure was put on it, it wasn't dropped, and was in a leather case the entire time.  It was a small crack in the corner (no exterior damage, of course).  I'd prefer to simply set three $20 bills on fire than purchase this useless ""protection"""
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Speakers,The speakers are great. I just don;t like the fact that the volume control is on the back of the subwoofer. The sound is great though
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Great alternative to Agent 18 ,"When I first started shopping around for a case, it seemed that Agent 18 had the monopoly on simple, minimalistic, hard cases. Then Rhino Skin finally released this aluminum case, and users finally have a viable alternative."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Phone,"This phone met all of my requirements and I'm very pleased with the purchase.  I wanted a cordless speaker phone without an answering machine, and the Panasonic fit the bill.  The user interface is very simple to use, you do have to go through several steps to add a new entry to phonebook but other than that it's great.  I use the speaker phone 75% of the time and the sound quality is very good without even using the voice enhancer technology.  Phone keeps a charge very well and has great range and reception.  I'm very pleased with the purchase"
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Great stand!,This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs.  It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders.  The page holders are easy to put back in.  It saves space on your desk.  I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks.  It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Nice Look, Nice Sound... Nice Everything!","I have been very impressed with these JBL Creature 2 speakers. I am upgrading from some low-end Labtec speakers, so I might be a little biased, but the sound quality of these speakers is fantastic! When doing my research online, I came across many reviews that mentioned poor mid-range quality. I'll be completely honest, it's there, but really not noticable. Also, there are plenty of pictures to look at, but once you get these on your desk, nothing does justice! It's like I have a work of art on my desk! And finally, you can't beat the price of this system. At ~$70, these speakers have great value! With all this in mind, do yourself a favor and order some for yourself! You won't be sorry"
electronics,4 of 17,1.0,real or fake,"I received two Sandisk ultra II SD 2GB cards from two different ebayers. When I compared to the one I got from Amazon, I found out both cards from ebay are fake.  Fake Sandisk SD card does not have a notch at the bottom edge of the card and do not have serial number printed on the back of the card although the packagings are very real.  These fake cards worked on and off with my Panasonic FZ50. The camera displayed reading errors many times with these fake cards.  Although errors often could be corrected by re-insert the card. But, I do not know if I would trust the fake cards because errors have occurred every time I used them. Finally, I have to use my card reader to review the photos that I took. So be sure your card is real before submit your review.  I was forced to give a rating. So, I gave one star for my fake cards and Sandisk web site which fails to help identify marks of genuine and authentic card"
electronics,3 of 6,4.0,Good quality DV tapes,"I bought them for use with my Panasonic GS-65 camera. No issues so far, quality seems to be fine"
electronics,0 of 6,5.0,Exactly as advertsied,"Excelent Service, Fast Delivery, good price, the only way it could have been better is if it was free, I will do business here again"
electronics,8 of 9,1.0,SHEESH!!!,"While this pouch does everything it claimed it would, it amazes me that I got sucked into buying this thing. It cost $17 of hard earned money and I honestly think a Crown Royal bag would do a better job. At least the Crown Royal Bag has a draw string that could be used as handles for carrying. You know what they say... a fool and his money are soon parted"
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,A must for home theater systems.,"I purchased these cables in connection with a new Toshiba DVD player, and it sure makes a difference in the audio quality over my old audio cables.  If you enjoy high quality audio with virtually no distortion or  interference, monster audio cables are a must"
electronics,24 of 26,5.0,Great companion for your iPod Shuffle,"This battery pack from Apple is just the right companion for you shuffle on trips with no access to USB ports. Plug in the shuffle into this pack and you are ready to go. And as with any Apple product it just works, you don't have to worry about buying an unknown brand accessory."
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,"Easy to leave ""off hook""","I bought one of these phones for my 94 y.o. mother who has nearly lost her eyesight due to macular degeneration. The phone works well enough, but the single Talk button toggles the hang-up function on and off. She can't tell very easiy whether she hit the Talk button and actually hung up. Consequently she has left the phone off-hook for many hours on several occasions. It would be better to have separate Talk and Hang-up buttons like cell phones have and also a bright red light on the phone to indicate the line is in use. The Talk button should also have a raised nipple or ring around it so that the person can easily feel when the button is under the finger"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Excellent pen-sized recorder,I got the Sony ICDSX46 -128 MD digital voice recorder to help me stay organized at work. I am constantly shifting between different clients/projects during the day and needed an easy way to accurately record the time I was spending on each. The Sony is small enough that I can keep it in my shirt or pants pocket without really noticing it. This means I actually bring it with me everywhere (one of the problems I had with other time-tacking methods). 
electronics,,5.0,"Small, precise and reliable mouse",This mouse is great to carry with your notebook computer. I have a G4 Titanium running Tiger and this mouse works well in OSX.
electronics,,5.0,Buffalo AirStation works perfectly,"I bought the AirStation to bridge my Slingbox to my router.  I works great, is relatively easy to set up adds all the ports I need for future media applications."
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,Buy the Canon ink and paper,"I have found that its worth the extra money to buy the Canon ink and paper. The quality of my prints is so much better using the Canon products. Also, its much more convenient to buy the multi-pack than to purchase each ink color separately, unless you're running low on a particular color(s). I've seen some posts that say it costs less to purchase the cartridges individually, but this isn't so when you consider price varies according to ink color. And--as always--Amazon offers the best price and shipping"
electronics,,4.0,Dependable Resource who sold it to me is great,"I thought I ordered this from Amazon but in fact it was sent out to Dependable Resource, These guys are top notch. I needed to return it for a different item they did not sell and gladly took it back even though it was over the 30 day time limit. The guys are great."

electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Great for the money,First the good.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great sound,"I almost never write reviews for products, but this time I really had to.  These earbuds are great.  They are way more comfortable than the standard ones that come with the ipod. I also think the sound quality is much better with these.  It's much clearer and fuller sounding than the Apple buds. I can't believe Apple is charging 40$ for an inferior product.  These really are worth the 5 bucks spent. :"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Fast Memory,"With the large file size of pro DSLR's shot in RAW, every little bit of speed counts, whether at capture or download.  There are faster Compact Flash cards out there, and there are definately slower ones, but for the price, this is a great card"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Center Speaker Value,If you're like me and have a modest 5.1 system in need of a center speaker- look no further. This piece exceeded all my expectations for a minus 100 dollar center speaker. The sound is crisp and clear. Highly recommended
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,thank you monster cable,I'll never forget the day I gave the order to throw away every single radio shack cable in the house
electronics,,4.0,Great little radio,"This radio has very good reception, picking up FM stations 40 to 50 miles away. The sound quality is good and clear for speech. Music is a little ""tinny"" as you have to expect from a small speaker. The dial is easy to read and the controls simple to use"
electronics,2 of 7,5.0,"Cheap, quiet, reliable","Cheap, quiet, reliable... Need I say more"
electronics,,4.0,Great sound; horrible cord,"I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great.  The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles.  However, it is just right for me.  I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate."
electronics,3 of 7,2.0,"Worked initially, Terrible support experience",I ordered the AmbiCom WL1100C-CF Compactflash 11MBPS WiFi Adapter after dropping a similar NetGear device in the trash.  The AmbiCom device worked immediately and well...for 3 months.  Then it stopped working.  That's when the real trouble began...
electronics,34 of 34,4.0,"Very nicely built and easy to use, but screen could be better","The Panasonic DVD-LS90 portable DVD player is a very nicely made portable DVD player, unlike the other brands out there which you find at Best Buy, Circuit City, Walmart, etc: Initial, Mintek, Audiovox, Samsung, Shinco, ... which often look like they'll fall apart after you pick them up.  The LS90 has a solid and confident build and nice styling, and is surprisingly lightweight for such a big-screen portable DVD player, even with the battery attached."

electronics,,5.0,Great keyboard,"I really can't complain at all about it.  The keys are easy to press, the media functionality works nicely.  The only thing that's a pain is logitech's drivers aren't that great, but the default windows one work fine.  I'd recommend it to anyone"
electronics,,5.0,Great product.,"Product works exactly as described, good quality. Definitely helped get the furniture closer to the wall and increased the safety of our electrical equipment"
electronics,,5.0,Tips for users,"If you find that they UPS is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up, there's something wrong with your configuration. The UPS is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer BIOS to restart the computer. This happens only after the UPS has sent a shutdown signal to the computer. You should not power on the computer until the UPS is done with its power up procedure. If you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after AC power is back, you should set your computer BIOS to Power On when AC power is restored. Since, while the computer is off, it doesn't know when the power comes back on, when the UPS cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on"
electronics,,5.0,Great Speed Stick,I was having trouble with my PC. The thing was running s-l-o-w.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Reliable, fast, well priced","The Brother printer works as advertised. What else can you ask for. Very reasonable priced, so far very reliable. First copy prints quickly (not a long lag to warm-up). A sold work horse of a printer"
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Good service.  Bad customer care and undesirable cancellation fee,"I was a happy customer of Vonage for 7 months.  The service was great, their website was excellent and the features they provided to control your account online was excellent.  "
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Amazing change in the picture quality,I bought this cable from Amazon for 23 bugs and I think it is worth every cent. my HD Ready TV is showing crystal clear DVD images in progressive scan mode. Highly recomended.
electronics,,5.0,Incredible and fascinating,"I don't know about you but this combo is stunning. I have never used a better mouse and a keyboard, and these two completely stand out from the crowd. They are a little bit pricy but at least you get impressive quality, design and comfort. Highest recommendation"
electronics,,5.0,Loved it before I even got it,"I had read quite a few of the online reviews for this GPSr and realized there wasn't much negative about it.  I was right, and I think I made a good investment.  Although this model has been updated with an expandable, this one I found new for under $300 and it does the trick for what I need."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Easy and perfect for TiVo'ers who never want to delete those special episodes,"I've had this unit for almost 2 years and it has been fantastic. As a long-time TiVo user, I often filled up my Tivo with shows (save-until-I-delete) that I didn't really want to delete. With this device I simply burn the shows I want to keep to DVD and then delete them off the Tivo. The DVD-burning is INCREDIBLY easy. Tivo and Humax opted for super-simplicity over more complex burning features, and I for one am glad they did. The DVD burning has always performed quickly for me and you can watch/record other shows while you are burning. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,High & Low end sound to spare!,"I searched for a over two years for a reasonably priced, quality center channel, and wow did I find it with this. I am using it as the center channel of my 7.1 surround sound system driven by a Kenwood THX certified amp, and the clarity of this speaker for dialouge is astounding! It has a great high end from the liquid cooled tweeter, and the low end from the 4 aluminum speakers really surprised me. This speaker is the perfect center channel for movies and music. It doesn't sound ""boxy"" at all. The only thing it lacks is a bracket to mount it to the wall, but hey. It also looks very sharp too. Buy it, you won't regret it. Thanks KLH!"

electronics,3 of 4,1.0,not usable due to SonicStage,"Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each ""artist"" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Helps boost volume level for GPS navigation,"I was using my laptop with Microsoft Maps for navigating in my car but I could not always hear the commands from the tiny speakers on the laptop, even when boosted to max.  This small, poratble speaker set allowed me to have a clear and loud voice that I could hear.  The speakers may not be the best for listening to music (although they are much better than the built in speakers in the lap top), but they did great for my use"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,sweet keyboard,"I just bought the ZBoard Merc and it's amazing. Its easy to install, and easy to use. I can use it for whatever, whenever. When I play Counter Strike I have the right keys under my fingers because they're in the perfect spot and the keyboard is in the right spot for typing up essays or documents. Buy this keyboard, it's that simple."
electronics,,4.0,My own little world,I'm on my second pair of these headphones. Just don't get so immersed in the sound that you walk away from your computer forgetting to take the headset off. It's a true testament to the sound quality coming out of this device. The earpieces seal nicely over your ears immersing you in great sound. My wife has to creep up on me now to physically get my attention because I'm in my own little world. 
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,HP Officejet 5610,Before I purchased this printer I had bought one for my daughter. She had used it for about 2 mos and loves it. I thought I would buy the next one up and then read the reviews on this printer as well as the more expensive ones. The 5610 comes with a higher review so I purchased the 5610. I am not sorry and am very pleased. I would recomend this purchas
electronics,7 of 8,4.0,Beats hanging it off a wall socket!,Great inovation!  Simple design does a super job of providing an excellent stand for the Airport Express!  Just set the Airport in the stand and plug the included power cord into the nearest outlet.  The position of the Airport makes checking the indicator light a snap and it is a much better arrangment than having the Airport hanging off a wall outlet or cluttering up a power strip
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A soild travel drive....with great capacity,"I have owned this drive for over a year, and it has worked flawlessly.  I do not need to plug it into ac power-it feeds right off my USB port.  Which makes it perfect for travel even if I am not taking my laptop."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Functional, convenient","My favorite part of this is the retractable cord. Makes cord management pretty easy since you can shrink it down to a compact size without having to wind up and worry about a longer cord than you need. That adds a level of convenience that other similar items may lack. Otherwise, it's functional - does what I expect it to. I've been pleased with it so far"
electronics,,5.0,It saved me once in the first two months,Pros: I installed it on the windshield and there is not cable! Alarm is audible enough even when I am listening to music at high volume. Mute button is very handy specilly when you are talking with the phone. Battery lasted more than a month! and I use my car every day.
electronics,,1.0,I got burned,"As a frequent Amazon Shopper, I tend to trust reviews.  This time, I went against better judgement and took a chance on these Memorex Dual Layer discs.  0 for 15.  Try another brand....I got burned"
electronics,,2.0,Logitech Knowingly Releases Bad Product,"How does a major company release a flagship product that is entirely incompatible with Windows XP.... the operating system on the VAST majority of computers in the world??  good question and one that Logitech can't answer. If you run windows XP be prepared to have major crashes and lockups with this camera. I managed to get it running with thier latest ""10.0"" drivers from thier website but it's only stable as a USB 1 device....if I wanted a slideshow cam I would have paid 20 bucks Logitech. All that said I believe it it a good product if you can get it to run...sooo up to you. I would not reccomend it until Logitech has proven they can support it...lame-os"
electronics,29 of 32,5.0,Great Quality just Way Overpriced!!,"These and all other brand cables from MC are all overpriced including these.  I have a 20"" JVC I'Art television and I have my DVD connected through component.  I have used Monster Cable component cables and they put out pretty much the exact same picture as my newer PHILIPS brand component cables that I only had to pay about [$$$] or so for.  The PHILIPS are also shielded and gold plated and all that good stuff. So buy these MC component cables if you dont care about price, but otherwise buy PHILIPS brand that are way cheaper and put out the same quality picture"
electronics,2 of 18,1.0,Be careful of what you think this is..,"First of all I thought Sat radio advertised "" Commercial Free radio"" was that. IT IS NOT AT ALL!!!! In fact I spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials. (...). They claim they have nothing to do with that. So this is a good buy IF you want another radio player WITH commercials (  A lot of them ) and to pay for it. I got this because I was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much. Well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing. So keep this in mind before you buy."
electronics,,5.0,Monster Cable XPMS-50,Very impressed with the sound.  I have it on my 5.1 system running proficient audio speakers. 
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,Don't use this card with Windows XP,I've had constant problems with this card since I upgraded to XP. I've given up on trying to make this work and I'm going to go buy another card
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent quality cable built to last,I would have to disagree with all those dissing Monster cables for digital use.  There are many aspects to these cables that make them worth the money other than whether they improve your signal or not. 
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Solid Performer,I have had several Toshiba TVs that have lasted a long time and always have a sharp picture. This one is excellent as well. One other ability Toshiba's all seem to have--they tune in stations sharper than most TVs. This was a resonably low-cost TV/DVD player but it performs like more expensive models. I have not ever seen a 'cheap' Toshiba product designed to SELL but not work well. Feel safe buying this TV
electronics,14 of 14,1.0,Awful,"This is very disappointing. It's huge, cumbersome, and uncomfortable. The worst part is that it's not elastic at all - just a hard rubberized canvas strap - so if you actually put it around your arm, it's alternately too loose and too tight as your arm muscle flexes just during a normal range of motion."
electronics,10 of 11,1.0,Portable unless you move it,"I purchased the DVD-L75 from BestBuy to entertain my young children on long automobile and airplane trips.  But from the moment I first powered it up, I noticed a major flaw: the slightest bit of movement would cause the unit to freeze-up, requiring a complete power cycling to restore it.  If the unit is placed on a sturdy surface such as a table or desk it worked fine, but if I so much as placed it on my lap while laying in bed, the motion of my breathing would cause it to crash."
electronics,,5.0,"Excellent, versatile product",everything it says it is and it's not as bulky as the adapters with large wires strung out the back of a oval looking hub.  Slick looking
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Decent! Which was a surprise.,"I decided to give these ear buds a shot.  I normally despise ear buds, but I recently started a corporate job where my over-the-ear set produced too much over-flow noise for a co-worker.  For a while, I tried to cope with the ear pain associated with the iPod ear buds, but it started driving me up the walls."
electronics,,5.0,Simple gadget does the job!,This gadget solved the problem for my old trusty Mac:  I needed to be able to switch quickly from feeding the sound to the speakers to feeding it to the headphones.
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,Not Even Compatible With Its Own Equipment!,"Bought the RangeMax wireless router about a year ago and don't notice that much difference from Netgears old 108 Super G router.  That one was rock solid for me and connected to everything as advertised.  However, after 3 different computers and hours of frustration I've about given up on getting anything above 54g using the WPN111 with the RangeMax router. Technical support was no help after several frustrating email exchanges there. "
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,machine washable; twice!,"First, anyone who would put all of their critical files just on this thing is nutty.  It's a backup device, very handy for moving files (images, .wmas) from computer to computer w/out burning a CD to do it.  If it pooches, you're out $35.  I am happy to report that it works after being washed.  Twice!  Don't use it as your sole source of critical storage and you'll be happy.  I'm on my second year with it now; still kickin'.  Great product"
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,I do see a difference,"Well was kinda of skeptical about ordering component cables, well figured the rca cables i was using was doing a fine job. well thats all they where doing , was a fine job, once i hooked up these cables to my dvd player i saw a big difference, picture was much cleaner looking all the way around. kinda glad i did some research on component to rca video cables now"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,cheap cost and assembly,The cases are are a good price but almost half arrived broken.  Not such a good buy when so many end up in the garbage
electronics,17 of 17,5.0,Excellent; one of a kind,"This mousepad is phenomenal.  It is not only durable, sturdy, resilient, and everlasting, but it looks beatiful and shines with overwhelming fluorescence.  I have encountered literally hundreds of mousepads in my life; this is easily one of the best.  If you relish the intrinsically natural tranquility of early morning life, then this mousepad is definitely for you.  Take my word for it"
electronics,,4.0,"Good Cam for Skyping and IMing, price is right.","This cam is decent for the price. It's a notebook cam and therefore very small. The quality of video is grainy and dark. But that's to be expected from a small, cheap webcam. It's still very usable in good lighting for Skype, Stickam, AIM etc. I keep this clipped on my notebook at all times. The cable is not too long and you can use the supplied velcro tie to keep it at your preferred length. It came with a soft case and a wired headset (one earphone and mic). I wasn't expecting the headset so that was a cool surprise. Overall you can't beat the price if you're not looking for perfect quality."
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Update on previous review,"While I did indeed receive the Monster Cable Banana Connectors in good condition, I have subsequently been contacted by Electro Galaxy regarding the previous review. Shipping fees that I grumbled about should have been taken directly to ElectroGalaxy prior to making a hasty review. Their customer service is excellent, providing personal commuication on products they sell. My complaint was the shipping and handling fees, of which they have provided a partial refund. My complaint should be with UPS, NOT ElectoGalaxy. This review is regarding the product not the vendor, Electro Galaxy. Electro Galaxy is a great company to do business with. However Monster product are a bit pricey and rely on a reputation of 'high-end' audio accessories to market their products. "
electronics,,5.0,"So far, so good.","I've had my D-Link DSL Router for two weeks and so far, it's been working like a charm. It installed instantly and it was up and running with no problems. I'm not very technical so when I buy a PC add-on I expect it to work out of the box -- and this one does. The only minor issue is that the ethernet cord [that come with it] was a too short for my needs, so I had to go out purchase a longer one. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this product and highly recommend it, especially for the price."
electronics,4 of 26,5.0,"Fairly good but,",this headphone is not the best one.
electronics,,4.0,Pleasantly Surprised!,"After reading these reviews, I was a little anxious about purchasing this product.  I found it on sale at Circuit City so I gave it a try and I'm glad I did.  It actually sounds pretty good for being such a small speaker and set-up was a breeze.  I'm going to buy another one"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Well Worth the Money,Expensive paper but if you want the best possible photos this is the way to go.  Can't tell the difference between photos printed on this paper and the ones I get from the photo developers.  Just wish the stuff was not so expensive :
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Nice,"It is kinda heavy but great, its got plenty of adapters to do all sorts of stuff, such as plug in 2 headphones to the same spot and other stuff, kinda expensive but still the best buy for this kind of product"
electronics,14 of 16,1.0,Beware of Inkgrabber.com,"Inkgrabber.com is listing refurbished and they send you compatible. BEWARE they do not sell what they advertise. They had no feedback when I made my purchase, so here is some accurate feedback"
electronics,,5.0,Good kit,"Easy to install, good reception and voice quality, short battery life. Very good idea to make Skype more regular phone like and save a lot of money!!"
electronics,1 of 6,5.0,Best Ipod cover money can buy!,"I just recieved this item today in the mail. This is the greatest cover for the Ipod Video I have ever seen! Very stylish and it offers great protection. I bought other covers before, and they fail to compare with this one! A must buy"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,OK product but the insurance promise is a scam,"I used Tripp Lite surge protectors for years, and when running a computer networking and repair business I recommended them to all my customers.  One attractive feature was the claim of $50,000 insurance to pay for any electronic equipment damaged while connected to one of their surge protectors.  After 15 years of using, selling and recommending their products, my house was hit by lightening and most of my electronics: computers, TVs, stereo, etc were fried."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Top MP3-Player,"I got the Zen V today and am positive surprised! It's small, easy to use, looks awesome, the display is clear and I have no problems with transfering files to the player (what is often a problem with MP3-Players). "
electronics,,1.0,Frustrating to use,"I'm a dedicated Treo user - have a 700P after having one of the first 600's in Texas and a 650 the day it came out.  Have been hoping for a good keyboard solution and have yet to find one.  I love gadgets, am not dumb, and found this product enormously frustrating.  First it wouldn't connect, then it did but it was impossible to navigate using the keyboard.  I don't mind the keys having shortcuts for Pocket PC and Symbian - no worries there.  But I've had Palms for years and often had to try 25-30 different, reasonable, increasingly less intuitive keystrokes before giving up tiredly.  Moving around applications doesn't make sense to me, and enter versus tab versus the green Fn key or the blue one... completely over the top in difficulty unless you want to use your stylus all the time."
electronics,,5.0,Easy navagation,This really is very simple to use..my only complaint is sometimes it takes me routes when I know there are faster/easier routes availabl
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,I give it one too many stars!,"This drive is very fast and convenient.  I liked mine and bought a second.  Unfortunately, they were like mice, they moved quickly and died quickly, one at 2 months, the other at 3 months.  With respect to tech support for the drive, it was easier to find on-line complaints than on-line service.  But the price is cheap.  If all you need to do is transfer documents between computers, I imagine you could buy a dozen and at least 6 would still function after a year.  The company needs to learn some basic lessons about quality control.  But did I say they were cheap"
electronics,18 of 19,1.0,If you have SP2 - be wary,"Plugged in, new HW found, but a problem occurred (code=1) when installing - strike 1."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,As good as it gets!,"This was the second universal remote control that I purchased.  I was a little skeptical, but after reading reviews, I decided to give this remote a try.  The first remote I purchased seemed more ""sophisticated"" because it came with a USB connection to my computer.  After no success with that remote, I decided to try this one instead."
electronics,,1.0,Uniden review,This is not a great phone.  The cordless phone has static and makes some weird clicking sounds.  You can't take the cordless too far from the base.  I wouldn't buy this phone again
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,The ONLY worthwhile USB surround-sound card,PROS
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Decent MP3 player,My wife has a Creative Zen Micro with the black and white LCD screen.  I liked my wife's player enough that I bought the newer Creative Zen Micro Photo for me.
electronics,,5.0,Must have for every active ipod owner,The DLO Action Jacket is a must have for all Ipod owners that workout or are on the go.  The armband is the perfect way to secure your Ipod when you are running or lifting.  I recommend the DLO Action Jacket to everyone
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Works as expected, but not to full potential","This little device is really helpful for switching audio hardware quickly.  I bought it to switch on to voice chat so that others in the house would not have to hear all the chatter that comes with gaming.  I also wanted an easy way to switch back to the computer speakers.  This product accomplishes its purpose pretty effectively.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is a slight drawback that moving to speaker mode switches off the microphone.  If you plan to use your microphone in conjunction with your speakers (that is... you are not using a headset mic and don't have feedback problems) then this product is not that helpful to you.  "
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Couldn't have asked for more.,"The service from Amazon was great, delivery people were most cooperative, made delivery as promised, placed TV in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,High Quality Product.  Best price.,"This 256MB CF Card I purchased for a keyboard-synth I own, and gave no troubles at all.   Great performance, great speed, no glitches and best of all, EXCELLENT PRICE."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Surge Plug,"This is the 3rd surge plug that I have purchased.  The first one met an untimely death do to a major water spill from a fish aquarium, but all the equipment attached to it survived.  All in all, these plugs are the best.  Each plug is labled and you get tags to label your cords (a nice feature if all your plugs are same color and style).  the added area for power packs is a nice touch as those take up so much room"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Well worth the cost!,"This is a top of the line remote, and well worth the cost. It does everything it claims, and does it with ease. It gives you the ability to connect to the internet to set you remote up with just clicking"
electronics,,5.0,Awesome Keyboard,"I love this keyboard that I am currently typing on. I have my laptop on an iLevel from Rain Design and this plugged into my laptop and it works fantastically. The sleep button is convenient, and the audio buttons work with iTunes for playing/pausing and skipping through tracks. The silver outline is a nice touch for this great keyboard"
electronics,,5.0,Great sound!,"Very impressive, especially for the price.  Hard to believe that such clean, crisp sound can come from such small, lightweight speakers"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Logitech MX 610 Left-Hand Laser Cordless Mouse,"There are two kinds of ""lefty"" mousers in this world -- those who are naturally left-handed, and those who prefer to mouse from the ""short"" end of the keyboard.  Lefties usually have to use either an ambidexterous mouse or adapt to a right-hand ergonomic design.  The MX 610 Left-Hand is an excellent ergonomic design that provides a natural fit for ""lefties"" - so score one for Logitech!  It could be improved, however, by adopting more ""tractable"" side panels so that dry hands do not slip during mouse maneuvers.  Logitech already has this feature on its ambitexterous wireless MediaPlay mouse"
electronics,11 of 16,5.0,Buy this today!,"The Creative Zen V is just that, Zen.  First off, it's the most adored electronic device I own; adored by all who see it.  The picture on-line does nothing for how cute it really is, and how compact it is as well.  It really can hold 500 songs and the quality is awesome.  The interface is SO much better than any other mp3 player I own and it is simply zen to use.  All in all, it's very worth the small amount of money it costs!  Buy one today, you won't regret it"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Monster Cable THX V100,"I've been using these cables for a couple of months now.  Picture quality is excellent, although this is my back-up DVD player.  My primary is being utilized with HDMI cables.  HDMI is the way to go!"
electronics,,5.0,BUY THIS!!!!! AWESOME!,"I recently purchased an Alienware computer with a Dell 30"" monitor and wanted speakers to match.  I wanted very loud speakers to shake the walls when I play games or watch DVD's.  These speakers are the loudest I have tried.  The shake the walls and house with great sound.  Some important ""pro"" features I really like:"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,As Expected,I received this as a gift and had wanted it for several weeks.  Looking around at the options this was sounded the best overall and is doing quite well for me daily. 
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,17BII+ problem,My biggest issue with the 17BII+ is the one that apparently plagues other users as well.  My first and sometimes second keystroke doesn't always register.  It happens randomly and is a major problem for me. I've gone through four of these calculators and three of the four had the same problem. I kept returning them until I got one that works.
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Better audio than FM transmitter,This device provides great audio.  It does a much better job than an FM transmitter.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great little printer,This printer is a great inexpensive way to be able to print photos on the go.
electronics,,4.0,Great buy,This DVD has it all - I love using the USB feature for Divx movies. I bought 2 of these unit from 2 different sources. Just make sure you shop around because local store can also price match the online price.
electronics,15 of 16,5.0,Good Bad and Ugly,Guess you can sometimes pick a good one over hundreds of bad ones...   I might say I was lucky.... or for the price this litte LCD is worth the price paid...
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,OMG!!!,"I'm just blown away! Moved up from 32 inch HD-CRT and love it. HDTV broadcast are fantastic as are DVDs. I now detest standard broadcast TV. I hooked up my media computer to this set and was stuned by the quality. Can EASILY read web pages/email from a viewing distance of 9 feet (BTW, Samsung recomends 7 feet min viewing distance). "
electronics,,5.0,Awesome product,easy installation and wireless is great. I had the modem and router in my living room and the signal strength was excellent there and was very good in all other rooms in our 2 bedroom apartment.
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,works great,"It's a great surge protector. Good number of outlets, well-spaced so everything fits"

electronics,,5.0,LaCie 300GB d2 External Hard Drive With Triple Interface,"Great, fast interface with mac os (intel)  however, the reported interface with windows xp is not so clean.  otherwise, excellent product"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,don't pay too much at the retail stores,"Don't be fooled by the claims made on expensive component video cables.  You don't need to pay the marked up price.  These cables work fine and buying the optical cable bundled with the component video saves you money.  I'm using them to connect my DVD player to my stereo receiver and 61"" DLP.  Works great! "
electronics,,4.0,Good wireless router,Stable in use but sometimes signal lost. Signal range is not as far as expected
electronics,,4.0,Great Product,"I'm very pleased with this mp3 player, it may nota have a very big storage but it seems to be enough, of course it depends of every person, I think it's better than any other player of 1 Gb, got FM,record from almost any device, uses AA batteries, it's got a great sound."
electronics,,4.0,Excellent buds,"I bought these ear-buds after first trying the Shure E3Cs. While I thought the Shures had excellent sound, they were totally lacking the low end punch, which left them without depth. I'm a rock & roll listener, not hip hop or club music, so I'm not looking for extreme bass- just what it should be. The Shures did not deliver. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,suits my needs just fine!,"I love my Ipod Shuffle. Sure, it doesn't have a display, and sure it ""only"" fits 100-120 songs, but it gets the job done. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Kingston 1 GB MMC+ memory card,Excellent product from long-time player in memory products. This memory card in my Nokia cell phone gives me nearly limitless storage for all types of media files.  The pricing was very good and I will not hesitate to look to Kingston Technologies for future memory storage needs
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Review from Iceland - Europe,"These are the best. Low pricing, excellent sound with strong bass. Should fit perfectly to every ears. Higly recommended."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Just buy it,You won't be sorry. I'm 60 miles from NYC and can't get WABC--a powerful station--without drift and static on two AM radios which cost three times what this one does. No problem with the Sony. Comes in clear. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,works great,"Worked great for my 15GB ipod. Unpacked, plug in, put my ipod in, press play and I was good to go.  Using it in a 12 x 12 office at low listening volume and find it to be just fine"
electronics,3 of 8,1.0,We Would Not Buy A Sharp Aquos TV Again!,"We purchased a Sharp Aquos 26"" TV (model LC-26GA4U) in the fall of 2004.  Ever since we purchased it, it has had a VERY annoying clicking sound when it is on, and even for a few minutes after it is turned off.  We have taken the TV to two different Sharp approved repair shops and they have not been able to fix the problem.  We have contacted Sharp twice recently, and have not heard back from them.  We are very disappointed in our TV and would not buy another Sharp again!"
electronics,16 of 16,2.0,Humax DVR800 w/ DVD recorder is not ready for Primetime,"I bought my DVR 800 in November.  The Tivo service is awesome but the Humax Box is terrible.  There was a problem with the IR Sensor on the DVR.  I had to push the remote control buttons several (10+) times before it made a connection.  I called Humax, the customer service rep. said they are having problems with the IR sensor. She asked me if I had the latest software version on my machine...I did.  So she sent me a new remote control.  The remote was not the problem.  I called back and they sent me a replacement (new or used) DVR800. "
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,It was the best thing at first......,"When I first bought this PDA for about $200, I was so excited. It was fast, very easy to use, and organized my whole life. After about 2 months, it died and did not recharge anymore. I called to get customer support and was informed that if they continued to help, it would cost me about $40. I was shocked and instead went online for help. Unfornately my battery had just gone dead. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent Digital Phone,"I have used the phone system for about three weeks.  I am very pleased with the quality of the phones.  The audio quality is excellent, even when using two or three phone in a conference mode.  The audio level and quality is unchanged for both the caller as well as the user.  The digital recorder is great.  It is easy to use and the the voice is clear.  I highly recommend the phone system"
electronics,2 of 6,4.0,Docking Station iPod Nano,"THis merchandise is very helpful in a sense, that you can charge the ipod nano on the wall without operating your computer. In that way, your worklow in using the computer is not being interrupted and still having the ipod being charge"
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,This is a Best Buy,"Pros:  Very compact, very comfortable, Great sound, Good envirnmental sound deadening."
electronics,10 of 25,1.0,Obviously not MAC compatible!!!,"Great disappointment. Plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications I own (Excel, Word, FreeHand among others) and displayed typed numbers (when it did) with extra spaces and squared characters. Should specify in the product description that is NOT MAC compatible. I'm not aware if PC users faced this problem as well"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Good price, Good sound","I'm no music engineer, but these speakers rock, especially for the price. All I want is to listen to itunes while I work and they definitley pump my music in just the right way. I would definitley recomend them to anyone looking for a great step up from the nasty sound the computer gives off"
electronics,,5.0,smooth installation and reliable connection,The installation is as smooth as it can be. The quality of the picture is great and the remote viewing is a bargain for the price opf $270

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Water-resistant headphones from Sony,"Through trial and error I have found that the headphones that wrap around each ear instead of the traditional band (over the head) style or earbud only style are best suited for very active work outs.  The problem for me was that a couple of the wrap around models that I tried did not do a good job of channeling my hard earned sweat away from my ear canal.  Sony has done a good job of incorporating their sport (water-resistant) over the head (band) style with the wrap around the ear style.  These headphones do a pretty good job of keeping sweat out of my ear canal, the wrap around allows me to be more active without having to adjust the headphones, allows me to more comfortably wear a hat...if I wish..and the earphones are more comfortable on my ears vs. having an ear bud stuck in the ear canal.  Amazon was about the only place I could find them though.  These are exactly what I was looking for"
electronics,,5.0,Linksys,"I use this for my PS2, my computer is in an upstairs room and my PS2 is in the basement. I am not a computer savy person, however this took a few minutes to hook up and works good. One thing I don't like is that every week or so I have to un plug it and allow it to reset it's self or my PS2 won't log on. Over all a great product and not very expensive either"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,5 years continuous use and still works great,"I've been using my Recoton for over five years to power my Braun electric toothbrush in Europe. Perhaps the only problem with the Recoton is the plug. As the converter is so heavy it does not always stay attached to well to the wall/outlet. I use mine in multi-plug strip that sits on the floor, so I don't have to worry about the converter falling out. If you plan on staying in one place for an extended period of time (i.e. not using the converter while traveling), I would suggest the Franzus 85 Watt available on Amazon. It's heavier and bulkier than the Recoton, but it's grounded and accepts US grounded plugs AND uses the Shhuka-style (grounded and recessed, holding the converter nicely in the wall) plug found in much of Europe."
electronics,,5.0,Heavy-hitting headphones for the rocker on the go,"They weren't kidding when they titled these headphones ""Skullcrushers"" because they clamp onto your head!  I can do any activity with these on without them sliding around and the built in amplified woofer brings new dimension to your listening experiance (like being in a car with sub-woofer suddenly turned on).  One miscommunication was with the volume adjuster supposedly on the headphone wire: the volume control is only for the woofer and it doesn't control the actual music level. Skullcandy offers a lifetime warrenty where they'll replace defects or offer you a new pair for half-price if you break them yourself. rock-on! I'm headed for the mountains"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great speakers!,I just got the speakers yesterday and I'm amazed. That's all I can say about them. A  little too much in   the line of cords but it's a small price to pay
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent,The item was packed nicely. The shipment was prompt. the customer service was helpful. everything went great. I would hop at Amazon.com again. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Must have on Windows, if you are a photographer working with Photoshop",Been waiting for the Windows version since I saw the product at PMA on Mac earlier this year.  Used the Windows version from the very moment it was available.  I touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great.  Tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end.  
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"A bit noisy when not in use, but does the job very well",We got this 200GB drive to help us with the additional task of backing up files between offices when we realized that our Seagate 160GB drive would not be enough to do both things: daily backups and data transfer between locations. Now this 200GB monster is sitting in one of the offices for our daily backups and the 160 GB (also a Seagate) is going back and forth and they are both holding up extremely well.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,just ordered my second pair,"  The first pair broke due to my own carelessness (severed a wire). The sound on these little guys is impressive for the price. Easily beats any earbud (maybe not all IEMs) and most headphones under $50. Audiophile reviewers can describe the sound better than I can, so check out those reviews."

This is highway robbery"
electronics,,5.0,Effortless to use this Computer Mouse,"This handheld mouse is so effortless to use you baarely have to move your fingers or hand. I bought it because I was having trouble with carpal tunnel syndrome in my hands and wrists and wanted to keep using a mouse to game and everything else I do on the computer. I also wanted it to ""read"" on any surface. Well, this Razor Diamondback fullfills all my requirements."
electronics,,1.0,Great... while it lasted.,"I loved the retractable connector, software was great, etc. But it died with no warning after just 28 days"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Good sound quality,"For such a small speaker, it can really belt it out!  I like the fact that I can use my Dell DJ and my husbands iPod with this system.  (Although it's really designed for the iPod.  The dock will charge the iPod, and the remote does not work on any other MP3 players.  You can only adjust the volume with it).  Just plug it in anywhere.  I put it in my kitchen when I'm cooking, or take it to camp and listen to it on the beach. "
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Works with Win98!,"My biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my Win98 (not SE) machine.  Ive only used it with Compact Flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine.  No install problems either, even though the machine/OS is pretty old."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,This is a great phone!,"I love this phone.  It has so many features to it, more than I realized.  I works like a charm, and is very easy to program.  The sound is good, both incoming and outgoing.  It is just the right size, not big and clunky, but just right. You will not get a better choice for the price. I have always had good luck with Panasonic products, and this is a great one too.  I highly recommend this phone unit."

electronics,0 of 2,1.0,Sound pretty bad,"These don't sound very good, I wanted to replace a pair of Grado SR60 open headphones I use at work so I'd make less noise, but I really don't like them.  They sound very cold and small, like listening to a cheap radio in another room.  Even cheap earbuds sound better.  I didn't expect them to sound as good as the Grados, but to  at least be passable.  I'm just going to keep using the Grados, and throw these in a drawer or something"

electronics,15 of 17,4.0,"As with anything, only buy if you NEED them!","These are cables are great if you have a system that might actually take advantage of them.  I have a 50' Sony LCD Projection and the Sony Dav-FR8 Dream System, if I did not own a television that had a native 720p format or equivalant and a decent progressive scan DVD, why would I buy a 50$ cable to connect them.

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Left-handed? This is the must-have mouse,"I've been using right-handed mice for years, most of them 'ergonomic', which is to say 'carpal-tunnel-inducing for anyone left-handed'.  This is the first left-handed mouse I've ever used, and it really is amazing being able to have all the nice ease-of-use functions right-handed users have had for so long, such as thumb buttons, a comfortable grip, and so forth."
electronics,,5.0,"Excellent quality, a worthwhile investment","I bought this backpack to lug my Dell E1705 17"" behemoth laptop around campus. Since I commute, I carry everything I may possibly need along with me. I've read the other reviews and thought that they seem to make one think that it may be too small. So I thought it might be useful to someone out there for me to list what I carry around with me 5 days a week, for several ""on back"" hours each day:"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,"Solid, for better or for worse","The laptop pouch is well padded and a reasonable size (though my 13"" Macbook isn't deep enough to fill it out), and there's a good variety of pockets.  I haven't found a good place for the computer's power cord, but it's easy to stuff a lot of books, notepads, pens, and mints in there.  The zippers and strap clips are solidly made; no problems yet. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Real Nice Product,"The Iriver H10 5GB is a real nice product , the sound is great,"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Not What I Expected,"I purchased the Addonics CardBus USB 2.0 Adapter thinking that it would be a fast and inexpensive solution to my USB port problem on my laptop.  I was aware of the fact that a power adapter would be needed at times.  I thought it would be necessary for powered devices such as a scanner or a printer.  However, I was not expecting to have to use the adapter to read flash drives.  Both of my flash drives are high-speed 2.0 devices.  Maybe that contributed to its inability to read the drives without the adapter.  Nevertheless this product was a major disappointment and inconvenience!  I would not recommend it. "
electronics,18 of 18,5.0,Flawless budget mini-stereo,"I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.  "
electronics,,4.0,"A little pricey, but.....","That's my only complaint about this ink. At Amazon the price is lower than office supply stores, and there's no tax and free shipping!!! I've been using it in my HP 940c printer for 31/2 years and have never had a problem. The color is very good in pictures, greeting cards, or whatever. It will usually last about 6 months under normal conditions.  If I print a lot of pictures as in online scrapbooking with backgrounds, etc., it runs out faster.  The HP website has an activity center with lots of print projects and tips for getting the most out of your ink and printer. One thing I don't do is refill ink cartridges or use any other brand or kind but original HP.  Also, be sure to align your print cartridges every time you change them, and clean them according to instructions with your printer if you do get streaks in your printout. This might help with some of the problems I read about in other reviews"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,easy as can be,The purpose of this purchase was simple. I wanted to use 2 computers over the same high speed cable conection.  Since I had not used either computer in a lan system I needed to install the device drivers on each system to activate my ethernet cards. I plugged the cable modem into the router and the router into both systems and everthing worked fine. One system was running windows xp and the other windows 98. Easy and simple

electronics,,4.0,Quality Phone,"I have been using this phone for a few months now and it is great.  Holds a great charge, clarity is very good.  It is a little simple in terms of functions e.g. not having a recently outgoing call list, but other than that, it is a great phone.  Highly recommended if you have a wireless network in your living area"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,Great DVD player for the price.,I ordered this DVD player and when it came to recharging the battery it wouldn't recharge. I phoned SONYs customer service which seemed good. The woman had me reset the player and the battery was still not able to recharge itself. SONY customer service said they  have been getting calls about the same problem with their battery rechargers. They told me to fax them my receipt with the event number which they gave me and they will send me a new charger. Its been over a month and  still no charger. I contacted Amazon about the problem. Amazons' customer service is very good. They told me they would send me a new DVD player and pay for my shipping back to them. I received my new DVD player in a matter of weeks. This new players battery charger works. Thanks....AMAZON!!!! 
electronics,17 of 19,5.0,Let go of the 80s! Burn TV on DVD!,"END OF SNOW! No, not Christmas! Snow on the screen! It is all over baby! Now is the time to end your VHS era. A SONY GX is a good deal. For SONY equipment I believe this is cheap. Any working Sony RDR-GX series has been a good buy for me. The RDR-GX is the answer to finally packing away that VHS and the VCR into the family time capsule. Using the port inputs I copied over the collection in a month and a bit at my leisure. Now my shelf has 10 times as much space for more DVDs. DVD recorders are bulky. Don't expect to find anything as small as a VCR or a brand new DVD player on the cheap; however there are relatively cheap RDR-GX recorders still in the shops. Go now. Getting anything, especially above the GX3 model or better, is going to last you a long time because the format is here to stay. The RDR-GX is uncomplicated to operate and set-up out of the box. It is simply - television aerial to aerial in, to SCART out, check the `tech specs' to make sure it has the INS and OUTS you want to use, or else you will have to adapt your system to meet the specs. The test of a recorder is in how it handles formatting, recording and more importantly, finalizing DVDs so that they will work on other DVD players, including PCs. The SONY GX can in theory burn a DVD for almost any type of player. If you do not burn your DVDs for all players then what is point if the recorder breaks or a new model comes out that is not backward compatible for some reason? Problem is that none of these manufacturers want you to find a way to get out of their brand (what you learn next here is not in the manual). The truth is that you got to start learning the recording formatting methods from the word go. When a blank DVD media is inserted into the drive it asks you to choose a format sometimes. Don't worry about big print on the screen during formatting, just switch over to your normal channel and not the one the DVD Recorder uses. VR or Video will appear. If you choose Video the recording is locked into the DVD and can not be moved around, like editing. In VR the video is not locked into the DVD and can be edited in the DVD. Problem is that DVD-VR has trouble playing back on some other drives. Using Video format is much more compatible, however you must `finalize' your DVDs. This is done by using in-recorder software tools that finish the DVD so that it can play on other DVD players. Although not all DVDs need to be finalized to do this, you should be able to burn a format that works on a number of other DVD players. The way to do this is with DVD+RW media. If it does not work then switch media brand a few times before resigning to DVD-RW. +RW may not ask you for a formatting mode (VR or Video), in which case the disk just needs to be finalized and it will work on your other players. Another tip is to complete burn DVD media in this system. That means, do not press STOP and let the system stop when the whole DVD is packed. This helps add integrity to the DVD format and information. Stopping a recording can sometimes corrupt a DVD. If you do stop you can sometimes record another piece, and so on, like chapters. However this can cause some DVD media to fail in other systems. There are several recording modes from high definition 60 minute modes to 3 hour extra long playback modes. Test your media compatibility first before you start collecting anything. Get it right from the start. DVD media is prone to failing. Don't sweat. Just test and test and find the solution. It is usually a four step - brand, type, formatting, finalizing. A good brand DVD+RW should help solve most problems. Test your media on your PC every so often to make sure it is good. This is the key to creating very flexible DVD recordings - Global DVDs."
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,good rainy day puzzle but not a print server,"Today has been too wet for yard work, but the TEW-PS1U has provided an entire day of entertainment. The home network runs fine both wireless 802.11b/g and hardline. This print server wouldn't connect to the wireless network, nor would it connect to an old 802.11b router.  Web browsers and the included configuration program could access this server only through hardline ethernet. The router didn't recognize the TEW-PS1U as an attached device and could not assign an IP address. However, if a fixed IP address was assigned to the TEW then it could be accessed by browser. The printer could then be assigned to the fixed address TCP/IP port. Unfortunately, the USB port couldn't access the printer. Yes, the printer works great from a computer USB port."

electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Olympus DS-2 better mic. WS-320M Ok mic and more memory," I own Olympus DS-2 and WS-320M digital voice recorders. I think that DS-2 is much better built, but it only has 64MB of memory which is a pity. Don't get me wrong WS-320M is still an excellent option if you consider it as a whole. The built-in mic is worse but you will still be able to make great recordings. I've done an extensive research before I bough my digital voice recorders and so far (2006) Olympus is the best choice in the $100 ~ $300 price range. Specially because it is light years ahead of Sony who always tries to impose their proprietary codecs down the consumer's throat, avoiding him/her to have access to its own recorded content. Shame on you Sony! These two digital recorders will offer you excellent recording quality, plus the ability to record using wma (windows media audio) which offers better quality than mp3, but still the same possibilities in terms of using what you've recorded on other devices. Not to say that I kissed up for Olympus all the way, WS-320M seems very fragile. Specially the on/off switch. It's almost an year since I bought it, and I pray everyday that its buttons won't die on me (specially the the switches on the left side). Please offer us a DS-2-like construction next time Olympus!

It's a very compact device like those key chain drives, until you attach a Memory Stick.  I wish MS would fit into the device but it didn't.  MS actually attaches to the side of the device and forms a 'L' shape.  Not easy to carry around with MS attached.  It worked on most of the PCs. It didn't work on some XP with USB 1.0.  "

electronics,4 of 6,4.0,Sony Memory Stick,"I have no complaints about Amazon on this item, but I do with Sony, because their Memory Stick is not ""regular"" sized.  It does not fit into my HP memory stick slot, so I have to use a cable connection with my Sony Camera.  My previous digital had a standard size memory stick that slid right into my computer.  I gave that camera to my son, who loves that feature also for his computer.  It's strange to me that Sony would choose not to be a standard size in this memory stick business.  It just does not make sense to me. "

It is very convenient to pop the iPod into the dock whenever it is not in use.  Formerly, my wife had some difficulty getting the iPod Shuffle correctly plugged into her iBook and sometimes it failed to charge the battery.  Now, she always finds her iPod ready to use - fully charged.  When she is finished using the iPod, she easily pops it into the dock.  It is a great convenience"

It took no time at all for me to get utterly spoiled by having a huge space to open multiple documents, multiple programs, everything at my fingertips. Plus, the display quality is drop-dead gorgeous. (And since I spend 8-12 hours a day staring at it, that's a big deal!) I would absolutely recommend this to anyone in the market for a high-end monitor."

Found that I used it for myself as well when flying.  Works great. The tablet style seemed to work out really well since he liked to hold it while watching.  I'm not sure why anyone would spend more money then this for a portable DVD player. The picture and sound are fine.  Good deal
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Space bar way too firm for small hands,"I have very small hands that type hard. The thing about this keyboard is that for some reasons, when you press the center of the space bar, it doesn't require much effort.  However, since I have small hands I can't always extend my thumbs to the middle of the space bar, pressing the sides of the space bar now become painfully tough."
electronics,12 of 12,4.0,Works well enough,This phone does a better job getting thru the interference created in the restaurant's kitchen than the unit it replaced (Uniden 5.8).  The voice alteration feature is fun for jokes but serves no real purpose.  The battery life seems adequate.  Unfortunately it does not hold the selection of ring-tones well for some reason and frequently reverts back to the default.  (as of yet to determine the cause for this - it is definitely not battery exhaustion tho)
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Easy to follow Instructions,I used this product over a year ago to create matching shirts for a business organization.

electronics,,5.0,Excelent DVD Player! =),"This is one of the best DVD Players that i ever seen. So far (4 months of use) i dont have any trouble, plays all (DIVx, MP3, 6MPX Photos..) from a DVD, CD or via USB Card Reader.

I am having major problems with mine. the left button acts like i am constantly double clicking and the scrool wheel wont roll upwards. I do like the look and feel and he buttons are situated in nice places, but for 60 bucks (which was what i paid for it at the time) I wish it would have lasted me longer than a few years.

electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Nice phone,"I bought one of these to replace my trusty, indestructible Uniden of 7 years that did not have caller ID, and my experiences with the new phone don't come close to the negative reviews it has gotten--quite the opposite, actually.  This is a nice, rugged phone with a light-up caller ID display and all the other features you would expect from a typical cordless phone.  I haven't had any range or static issues.  Sound quality is fine and battery life hasn't been a problem. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Awesome Accessory,This is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers.  You don't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming!  Excellent travel accessory
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,Unstable-Internet Connection Drops,"I started to pass up the chance to rate this until I saw how high the overall rating is.  The user group on the NETGEAR www site documents how unstable this card is and the dopped internet connection issue.  I agree with all those who mention ease of installing etc.- then BAMM! After about 2 months, internet connectivity becomes an issue.  I had not been to the NETGEARS users group before.  Before buying this item go to their web site and search for ""internet drop"".  Lots of customers are dissatisfied with this card-BEWARE! I have tried lots of fixes-uninstalling/reinstalling/using the NETGEAR Mgr/using the WIN XP mgr-nothing seems to work. Untold hours spent.  This is my last gasp-now searching for a Linksys replacement as recommended by others"

electronics,,4.0,"Not for everyday use, traveling ok, slightly larger than expected, but overall good for price.","I was looking for portable speakers for traveling, I couldn't find the dimensions for the product anywhere and they are larger than I expected about 3.5in x 3.5in each, they do not get very loud, but if you have high quality files on your ipod then the sound is adequate or loud enough for a small room. I do wish there was a control on the speaker that could adjust the sound, however for under $12 these are a good deal and require no batteries or to be plugged into an outlet...just plug into audio device headphone jack. Do NOT buy if you like to blast music or to use as main source of speakers. For really good speakers I suggest the apple creatures, those are fantastic, small and very clear, not portable though"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Excellent purchase ...,"The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. "
electronics,,5.0,No complaints,I bought these for my 12 year old son to use as his gaming headset. This was the third pair that we had tried.  The other 2 pair were tight on his head and  seemed to be uncomfortable around his ears. These have been fine for him and they seem to keep all of the background noise out especially my voice.  He says that the microphone works well that he has had no complaints from the people he plays with.

electronics,,4.0,creative zen nano,The mp3 player is not to bad. I love the size because it is comfortable to carry around and fits anywhere. I kind of wish it had a little more space for more music but besides that I'm pretty satisfied with it. If your looking for a good mp3 player and dont want to spend a lot of money this is a good one
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,AMAZING customer support!,"I have a hard time remembering life before my QC2's.  I take numerous plane trips per year and I even use them on the bus on my commute to work.  Every song sounds better through them and the noise-cancelling makes any environment your own private listening booth.  I read in another review on this page that a person had the headband on their set break and they were able to call and got them replaced.  When the right side broke on mine, I called the customer service line and within 3 minutes had an RA# and an address to ship mine for an exchange.  Between the quality of the headphones and this kind of customer support, I will be a Bose customer for a long, long time"
electronics,12 of 15,2.0,Defective,This item worked great for the one month it worked. I'm now waiting for a replacement because Iomega determined the equipment to be defective. I sneaked a peek inside before shipping it out and saw the hard drive inside is actually a Seagate. Maybe I'll steer clear of both brands from now on
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Washable,This is a nice flash drive. It comes with security software already on it. The best part is that I accidently left it in my pocket and it went through Washer and Dryer. It survived and it still functions.
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Great!  Except for the darn power button.,"I'm on my second Palm TX, the first one I had to send back for repair on the power button.  After having this one for 6 months or so, the same thing is happening again.  I don't ""mash"" the power button so I'm contributing it to a design flaw.  Otherwise, it's a great PDA, better than the previous Palm models.  The battery life is good, the wireless features are good too"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,THE BEST,I have tried other ear headphones from Sony and Panasonic. Was not satisfied with their performance.
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Excellent with XP,"This item works excellent with XP, you get an excellent signal with excellent software.  The ugly antenna the person before is talking about is a 5 db antenna, while other manufactors only give you a cheap 2 db antenna.  That is why the reception on this item is so good.  Also who cares about the antenna, when it is behind the computer and you cant see it, but you can see the excellent reception.  You are not buying it for looks, but for the performance.  The software does not work with 98, even though the ratings says it does"
electronics,,5.0,A great cordless handset,Since we moved into our house several years back we've had a problem that the phone company wanted to charge a fortune to run wiring into our bedroom because of it's location.  We bought a panasonic phone for the kitchen and added it's matching handset for our bedroom (this one) and have loved both.  Not one complaint and I am a tough sell on phones!  We've had them for a year and I love the fact that we can add an additional handset where there is no wiring with no problem.  Just need an outlet to keep it charged
electronics,8 of 20,1.0,Tough Call,"I printed the same photo with the photo on an HP 6840 using 99 phot ink cartridge, then the standard black 96 and then 96 w/o HP enhancements. At first I thought the 96 was better than 99 because I got beter red saturation, until I realized that the red hue was stronger throughout the photo at the sacrifice of some green and whites that were not as brite. "
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,lots of love,The world now is very iPod-centric but the incredible sales of iPod players don't mean iPod is the best digital music player on market. For me personally there few better ones. iRiver H10 is one of them and here is why I bought it.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Well worth it!!,"I've been using this projector for 6 months now.  Not just for movies but regular tv (also HDTV) and xbox 360.  I have about 600 hours on the bulb.  A few times the unit didn't want to turn on and I thought the bulb had burned out (see other reviews) but I let it sit for a couple of minutes and it turned on with no problems.  In my opinion, DVD's, xbox and the HD channels are projected beautifully!  I never knew a projector could look so good.  With the price of this projector continually falling, the deal just gets better and better.  My neighbor spent $3,500 on a 50"" plasma, I don't think his picture (HD) is any better than mine and less than half the size (my screen is a 120"" widescreen).  I spent a total of $2,400 for my projector, screen and cables.  Even if I have to buy 2 bulbs a year it will take over 2 years before I equal what he paid and I've still got twice the screen size!  I'll take that anytime!!"
electronics,5 of 7,4.0,"Not great, but really cheap","I like it.  It's got poor resolution, it's hard to get the reception in, and if you're too close to it while it's on, the reception goes out, but it only cost 16 dollars, so I find it hard to complain"
electronics,4 of 23,1.0,I wouldn't waste my money on this!,"10 base ethernet is outdated technology.  I worked for my school's info-tech department for a year and Netgear hubs were notorious for breaking, we have since switched to agere and have far fewer problems"
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Best in the category,"I have used several WebCams and see that most require lots of light to work fine, while this comes automatically with a low light filter."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,200 degrees,"Bought this about a year ago and it is still woring without any problems with the endless hours of usage with GT4. The 200 degree angle setup is perfect and fun when playing Formula One as well. I see people complain about the stifness in the wheel which actually adds to some of the realism of racing, taking corners at high speeds. Highly recommended"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great form factor...nice sound,"I went from some Altec Lansing MX 5021 speakers to these and I am quite impressed.  I am an avid gamer and shoutcast/mp3/xm listener.  I've always had 2.1 speakers as I don't see the need for huge 5.1 or 7.1 sets.  The MX5021's were nice but were HUGE in size and sounded a little too bright.  I really like the unobtrusive size and they fill up my apartment quite nicely whether playing BF2, listening to winamp or even watching slingbox.  The bass is more than adequate and quite surprising.  I only have the bass set to 1/2 and it thumps nicely though not as hard as the Altec and I'm sure not as much as some Klipsch's.  But hey I'm not looking for a lease breaker here.  Just something that sounds good and looks good at the same time.  The puck control is ingenious and well thought out.  "

electronics,23 of 26,1.0,Changing Combos,"I am a student living in a dorm situation and so wanted some basic protection for my lap top computer.  I purchased the defcon cl because it was inexpensive, widely availible, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, it has one major drawback, occasionally it decides to change the number combinationss which unlock it.  I went to the company website and they suggested trying the numbers immediately around the combination and if that failed trying all the number combinations possible (there are 10,000).  Several hours, one blister, and 1787 combinations later, I got frustrated and used a jewelers saw to cut through the connection to my computer (this solution took only five minutes).  I would not suggest this lock to anyone who lacks the patience to try trial and error experimentation until they reach the correct combination, nor anyone attending a school with a metalsmithing program"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,"Has separate buttons, not the infamous donut",Just a note to let anyone interested know.  I recently purchased this item and it is the improved version with separate direction arrow buttons. 
electronics,15 of 15,2.0,If you need All-in-one to be part of a wireless network read this!,"I have owned this printer for a little more than one year. Some people have had enormous problems with this product and I am one of them. Whether you will have problems or not depends on your network configuration and OS/Service packs. If you have a wireless network in your house and you need to connect this printer to it, you could be in for some unpleasant surprises! The problems that I will describe have been documented and acknowledged by HP and has not nothing to do with not following instructions."
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,"Great Design, Poor Quality","I wish I had read the other reviews here!  After just a month or so of using the mouse, the left-click is done for!  Like other reviewers have said, the left button has to be pushed with a lot of force to get it to work.  I really like the design of the mouse; the way it fits my hand, the side buttons and everything, it's just not built to a decent quality standard"
electronics,,5.0,excelent service,The best value in memory stick is SanDisk. Quality and very good price. I will buy again SanDisk products.
electronics,,4.0,Good as long as you're not downtown or in a crowd,"Does a fairly good job when you're out in the open, but if you're surrounded by buildings or in heavy trees it tends to lose the satellite signal which fouls up your distance and pace measurements. The heart rate monitor seems to work okay but also seems to sporadically lose its signal (maybe when surrounded by other heart rate monitors, like when in a race.) Has lots of nice bells and whistles and the software that comes with it is nice for uploading and viewing all your running/biking history. All in all it's good for training on your own out in the open, but not so hot for running in the city in large groups."
electronics,,5.0,Good Protection,"I've lived with this product for about two weeks now. So far, I'm very happy. It is a tough, thick silicone case that should provide good protection against bumps and accidental drops. It's much easier to put on than other silicone cases I've had. I haven't used the belt clip yet, so I can't comment on that. The only downside is the plastic screen protector--it scratches easily. I think that it would eventually be difficult to watch a video through. For now, I'm going to cut a piece of my Dell Axim's plastic film screen protector and put that on the plastic insert. FYI, I checked Speck Products web site and they sell replacement screen protectors and belt clips for a very reasonable price"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,"Nice, but - I wouldnt buy again","These are nice headphones, but I would not buy them again. Not quite sure why I spent $100 on them, they seem about the same as any of the 40 dollar pairs"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,"Finally, full-blown sound and isolation in a cheap portable","I'm about as picky as they come when sound is the issue. I have a home recording studio, with 30 years of experience as a semi-pro musician (jazz, rock, classical, country). That said, I approach every musical equipment purchase with thorough research and comparison. Since I have good wired phones (Senn 280s and others) in my studio, I wanted some lightweight portables for the long walks I like to take at the beach and elsewhere, often while listening to recordings I've been working on. (I use a CD walkman, with no EQ options.) Several other small portable cans that I own are just not hi-fi enough to enjoy: my ultra-cheap JVCs sound ultra-tinny, and my Koss SportaPros (while much better than the JVCs) have such dominant, boomy bass that the other frequencies cower in the background. The only models receiving consistently strong reviews are the Senn px100, Koss PortaPro, and AKG 26p, but of these, only the AKGs offer a closed design that provides some isolation, something I definitely need. (If you're trying to protect your ears, as I am, then the closed design is helpful. Less outside noise, less volume needed. Plus, the peaceful isolation just feels good while roaming.)    "
electronics,8 of 10,1.0,Don't Buy It,"Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages"
electronics,,5.0,Fun to type again,This is a superb keyboard.  Great feel...wonderful features...had no idea how much difference there was between keyboards til I got this beauty
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"COIN CELL LITHIUM, 3V, CR2032, 5 PACK",Quick delivery; perfect condition; best bargain for the buck; highly recommend this seller
electronics,7 of 9,1.0,I guess you get what you pay for,"This is a well priced and attractive piece of equipment.  But judging from my experience and that of some others, the quality control must be almost completely lacking.  I setup my new Simpletech USB drive and backed up my entire desktop hard drive using the included software with no problem.  Immediately after, my desktop stopped recognizing the drive.  I tried it on my laptop with the same results.  The drive was not recognized.  So now I have my entire hard drive backed up on the Simpletech with no way to access or even to erase the information.  Sure Simpletech will replace the drive, just send it back with all my information on it.  No way.  So now I'm stuck with a useless brand new piece of equipment.  Beware of this brand"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Leather Flip Cover,The plastic mounting device that secures the leather flip cover to the M5 is very poorly engineered.  I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken.  I am seriously considering replacing it with some other protective device
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great item for the price but the plug slide covers stick,On my unit i had to press pretty hard to seat a plug. Its not because its really tight its because there are internal slot covers that do not properly slide out of the way at times. Other than this incovience I love the layout....removed 2 other surge protectors from behind my entertainment system.
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Pretty useful product,"You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough."
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Ideal document scanner,"I am a heavy use of DevonThink Pro office software for the Mac, and the Fujitsu ScanSnap for Macintosh is the absolute ideal companion for scanning documents. DevonThink Pro does a lot more than hold pdf documents, but turning paper into pdf for long term storage is a major issue even in my small one-man office. This combination of tools allows me to scan any loose sheet paper, and then throw it into a storage box that I've never have to open again. It would be better and cheaper if Fujitsu left out Acrobat standard edition, and replaced it with DevonThink."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,PSP and other digital devices compatible,"This memory stick works well with the PSP. Even though it does not have the 30g carrying capacity of an ipod, you can just choose a set of songs you want to listen too and put them on in a flash, thanks to the high speed capabitlies of this memory stick. And once you think of it, Isn't it cheaper to just buy a memory stick like this one of amazon then buying a nano? Isn't is easier than carrying both a psp and another mp3 player or something?"
electronics,29 of 40,5.0,Power UPS! Everything you need to know.,"First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin"
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,You get what you pay for,Here's a quick comparison for my wireless mouse:
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,iPod Dock,I bought the dock for my 60 gig photo iPod.  I consider this a must have for the iPod.  It makes charging and syncing with iTunes a snap.  The audio out and S video are also very very handy
electronics,,1.0,Garbage,"This was useless, the mic had ZERO sensitivity, I had to literally stick the mic into my mouth and yell for it to move any of the bars on my computer sound recorder, not to mention the games i played didnt even recognize that I was talking at all. Bought this two days ago, taking it back to best buy today."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,THIS THING ROCKS!!!,"I bought this laptop desktop stand because I was a bit envious of my girlfriends setup.  She also has a laptop set up as a desktop, but she got her docking station and laptop from dell at a hefty price, one that I could not afford.  Well, after shopping around for some cheaper options I stumbled upon the Kensington Laptop Desktop.  After a few weeks of usage, I have to say that I am very impressed with it.  Not only is it a snap to put the laptop in, but it simplifies the reverse process also.  I can easily slip my laptop out of the docking station by simply unplugging the usb cable that comes with it from my computer, and then slip my computer into it's carrying case in the morning on my way to work.  Then when I get home from work, it only takes me less than a minute to slip it back into the station and get booted up again.  This is the best accessory to my laptop I've gotten so far, and to tell you the truth, I think my girlfriend is envious of my setup now and how much it didn't cost me to do it. Hahahah!!  The tables have turned!!  I recommend this product with full force!  You will like it"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Great Headphones,"Sony's new line of high quality headphones are geat. These are replacing my pair of sennheiser's more expensive HD590s. I find the sony's more comfortable (although, when you get to the same comfort level as the Sennheisers, it does not really matter any more), and I prefer the sound. They are not *better* than the 590s, for the sound is a bit brighter, which some people do not like much at all. Anyway, just saying these are worth it. Great headphones."

electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Great All-In-One!,This product has worked great for our home.  The primary reason we purchased a new all-in-one was due to the cost of the replacement cartridges of our old brand.  These cartridges are very reasonably priced and the quality of the prints are great
electronics,1 of 5,1.0,"Incredibly inconsistent, and a waste for me.","Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Great little product for the money,The product arrived sooner than expected and a snap to install.  Just pop it in and it pretty much installs itself in WinXP.  The reception range is not as strong as an internal card but that's what I would expect at this price.  You shouldn't have any trouble connecting to your own local network though.  Very pleased with the product

electronics,1 of 1,4.0,DVD-LS90 Portable by Panasonic,"My first experience with a Panasonic portable DVD player was with the LS-50, which I rented at an airport. I loved it, ended up buying a used one thru eBay. Should have bought it new and with a warranty! Got 1 year out of it, then the HO:3 message. Thinking to buy the LS-50 again, it is now more costly  than the LS-90 which replaced it, so I went with the LS-90 after reading customer reviews. So far I have been very happy with it. I do find I constantly compare it to the LS-50 - which I liked better. Why? Smaller screen, more controls on the unit itself (thus less need to use the remote). The LS-90 has a larger screen, which is fine but needs more care in opening, and there are many controls that are only accessible by using the remote, which I'm not big on. BUT, the remote works great, the unit works great, sound could be louder but it's not supposed to be the only home entertainment unit. The player I bought came with a great travel bag and awesome headphones, so overall I've been very pleased with the purchase. Great price, but I am investing in an extended warranty. This unit probably deserves 5 stars, but I gave it 4 because I do think the LS-50 is a better unit"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,A Mike for the Starting Musician,"Personally, when I decided that i wanted to get into recording I really wasnt sure of what kind of mic to look into and when you first start out learning about different kind of mics and stuff all of its a little overwhelming. Condensers and what not. But thats when this mic caught my eye. Someone remarked that if anything it was only good enough for home studio use and that was much more than I wanted for a better price then i could have imagined. So after much deliberating I ordered this mic."
electronics,,4.0,"Good Phone, Lacks features...","I have had this phone for over a week. I love the quality of speakerphone thus far. People can hardly tell if I am speaker or handset...However, For a SOHO phone, Polycom has missed the mark on ""HOME OFFICE"" part. I make a lot of conference calls and all of them have passcodes etc...I am disappointed with the speed dial capability. "

electronics,,5.0,Great Product,"Garmin makes great products, and this is one of them. Not bulky, I've taken it on my bike, and canoe, as wellas running. It's pretty accurate, and does a decent job with altitude. The map that the software overlays your course on leaves much to be desired though. I'm hoping Garmin offers an upgrade"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,"Another ""I didn't think it was possible"" review",I am absolutely amazed.  I am in the ground unit of a condo without a wall facing the signal towers which are approximately 30-35 miles away.  Even after reading all of the possible reviews I didn't think that this little thing could do the job it does.  I used to have HD through comcast and this is as good.
electronics,,5.0,good stuff,Even when this bag is full I have to double-check to make sure my laptop is inside
electronics,1 of 4,5.0,Very well,"Adorama Camera works very well, they sent the product rapidly and arrived in good conditions"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Reliable value,"I have bought 3 of these and they work well. They are reliable and they print thousands of pages, although I have never done a count. I recommend this as an economical solution to quality monochrome printing that would work for home or office. I cannot recommend this product against generic or no-name versions, but I can confirm that it provides a very high level of quality for value when compared to HP and other more expensive printers"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Prints fine--uses unk quickly,"This is my second ink printer for the current HP computer I own and it prints much quicker than the last printer. However, changing the ink every three months is a little often, in my opinion"

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"In an Emergency, This Is Worth the Investment","I purchased an emergency radio to have in the event of an emergency.  Duh!  And it seems like the charger, lights, siren, and radio reception will all perform adequately should that happen.  My teen wasn't awed by the sound quality, but that's not the criteria here."

electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Delivers as Promised,"I just got a Panasonic Plasma ED TV and was concerned to get a good surge protector that might also enhance the picture quality. Before getting the Monster HTS 1000 I noticed some annoying picture glitches occasionally cropping up (I get a directv standard digital signal): a kind of vague line that, especially when background colors were pretty homogenous, you could follow moving up the screen; the kind of thing you could easily overlook but once you notice it, you can't help seeing it and it drives you crazy. Since running everything going into the tv through the Monster 1000, it's completely disappeared. So, this thing really does seem to deliver on what it promises: a cleaner picture"
electronics,,4.0,"Not as soft as the foam type, but good",If you need firm support for your carpal tunnel this is perfect.
electronics,,5.0,Perfect!!!,You can never ask for more from this product. 2700maH. That's huge. Runs my discman for weeks (I roughly listen 1 hr everyday). 
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,Great Product,"1st off, this is the only photo printer I've used, so I can't compare it to other manufacturers/models. I'm more than satisfied. The print quality is outstanding and the printer driver works great from multiple applications. The manufacturer claims the printer ships with paper and an ink cartridge for 20 prints. I did get the 20 sheets of paper, but I've already printed 30 photos and my ink is about 20% used, so apparently they ship this printer with a full (100+ prints) ink cartridge, so it's probably a safe bet to buy some extra paper."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Good but not secured,"This BL-C30 is very easy to set up because it has the auto-configuration.  The Dynamic DNS service is very handy too.  While my wife and I were away from home for a month last time, I used it to monitor my home once in a while.  However, there are 2 things you may need to consider:"
electronics,,4.0,Good speaker at a good price,"The speakers were easy to install and work well.  For the size and price, they are a great deal.  The bass response is not great, but that's not what you are looking for in speakers like this.  I'm not sure they would be worth the original price at $250, but at &lt;$100 they are well worth it"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Best GPS for the Price,"I heard a lot about the Tom Tom and even had a salesman try HARD to sell me the Tom Tom over the Garmin but the Garmin price had me cheap out and GUESS WHAT - I WIN!!!  I have a friend who spent up to $200 or more for a similar Tom Tom and my Garmin is just as good.  The only downside was I ended up spending about $200 more (much later) on eBay buying maps and accessories (memory stick) BUT ONLY because I wanted to do more with it than I originally intended.  The base maps are good but the map packs (Street Maps) by Garmin are also worth every buck.  My only complaint is that it's not so easy marking a point of reference on the fly which may not be an address listed or an address you know.  There is a way to do it but every time I figure it out (by accident when I'm not looking for it) I forget how when I want to.  Oh well, I still love it and would most definitely buy Garmin again"
electronics,3 of 5,1.0,Who really knows until it's too late...,"This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200."
electronics,43 of 47,5.0,Superb visual and audio clarity from a webcam. Best on the market.,"  Logitech promises vastly improved image quality in this webcam because of its new lens, which is all glass. They aren't kdding. The image quality is superb, approaching that of Hi-8 videotape up to 960 x 720 video resolution and the interpolated 4 Megapixel still image size of 2304 x 1708 pixels."
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,Works as designed...mostly,"It does everything they sayt it does. My only quibbles keeping this from 5 star status is Windows Media Player insists on loading media into the small internal memory rather than my 1 gb sd card. And the wireless occasionally does not connect to my access point, dropping th ewep key settings when it doesnt connect right away.  One other flaw is the terrible IR range. "

electronics,,5.0,Great item everyone should have!,"This dual drive speaker with the subwoofer is superb. The sound quality is great, and those who love listening to music from their PCs should get one fast. At max volume, it may blow off the top of your roof! Seriouse. This is the best item i have bought online for a while now. Shipping too was swift. Its one thing which gets me rushing home each day after work."

electronics,6 of 12,2.0,Good if you don't need to travel...,"The Pocketec HD does as advertised and works well-- if you don't need to travel.  I've had my hard drive for about 6 months and it has completely stopped working.  When it was work, I had good transfer speeds (USB 2.0) and it was USB powered, which is why I had gotten rid of my old portable hard drive.  This one might have been okay if I kept it in a case that provided more cushion than what comes with the unit, but I'll never know now.  So if you just need a stationary portable HD (maybe to transfer between different systems in your home or office), then this is probably perfect.  If, like me, you are on the road at least 1-2 weeks a month, you'll want a more robust hard drive that won't crash on you"

The only thing is that it only works with  certain Sony cameras, the new ones work only with memory stick duo... but thats ok.."
electronics,,5.0,"easy setup, great product","It took less than two minutes to configure the mouse and begin using it.  Connectivity is excellent, and tracking is as good as any wired mouse.  It is very small, but its weight and length are comfortable even for large hands.  Highly recommended"
electronics,,2.0,Not good,"The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution"
electronics,,5.0,Delphi Definitely Does it,"My daughter bought one for me last Xmas, but I got tired of her 'borrowing' Dad's, so I got one for her birthday in August.  While I pretty much use mine in the cars (have two car kits) and occasionally at home (where it even pipes out to the FM radio near our backyard hot tub), she really exercises all of its capabilities by recording songs, carrying it around while out and about (no reception problems with built-in antenna only) and now she's been cradling hers into MY Altec-Lansing speaker system (another quality option), so it looks like an Altec-Lansing may be in her future for Xmas.  Overall, couldn't be happier.  Indeed, if Amazon hadn't hiked its price nearly 20% since August, I'd be in their market for yet another for my other increasingly jealous daughter (thank you XMradio for the family discounts!). "
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Nice for the Price,"This is a nice thing to have when you want to block out surrounding noise and still enjoy what you are trying to listen to.  The first day I had them I was in a room with a TV on listening to music and when I activated the noise cancelling feature I couldn't hear the TV at all and then my wife came in and started talking to me and I could not hear a word she was saying!  She didn't believe me so she put them on and I started talking and she didn't think I was saying anything.  Long story short, they work very well for blocking out unwanted noise.  We even use them when doing yard work to help block out the noise of the lawnmower, it doesn't block it all, it's a lawnmower, but it does help you hear the music more clearly than without noise cancelling.  They also include a carrying pouch and airplane jack converter"
electronics,,5.0,excellent deal!,I got it at very reasonable price approx 4 bucks sells for 9-10 at retail stores. Works great and nothing can beat this deal!!!! only if its free...!! ha!ha
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Well worth the $$$$,"I bought the iQue 3600 Bundle several months ago now and use it every day.  The unit has operated flawlessly.  I've read other reviews below (with attention to others ""cons"" for the product).  I am always curious about overall product quality and other people's experiences.  Plus, I like knowing if there is a problem that I have not experienced - if I do experience it, at least I'm not surprised or disappointed.  "

electronics,,1.0,Linksys WRT54G is a dud for Apple/Macintosh use,"Avoid this product like the plague.  After discovering that there are zero instructions for Mac users, and after over one hour on the phone with out-sourced tech support, this baby is going back in the box AND back to the big box store.  My old Linksys was great: easy to set up and reliable.  So sad to have to switch brands"

electronics,30 of 32,5.0,Canon S830D Photo Printer,I have the digital camera Canon Powershot S200 and just purchased this printer. Set it up last night without any difficulty and the photos I printed were fantastic. I am very pleased with this purchase. Would highly recommend this printer. I did use generic photo paper to start out with and it worked just fine. I am hoping that in the long run this printer will pay for itself and cut the costs of having pics developed at the store
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,This thing does it all.,"I needed a good way to carry my laptop onto planes and around the E3 show in Los Angeles, CA. So I purchased this backpack. It is everything I had hoped for in a laptop backpack. This thing holds my 15 inch Sager 5690 perfectly and the protection is top notch. The bag has room for pretty much any and all business related items you would think to bring. It has great construction, roomy compartments, and the overall TARGUS quality you'd expect! I recommend this to anyone except people who have laptops with bigger screens. I hear some 17's fit in here, I just don't know which ones"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great value for 7.1 system,"I have had these speakers for about a month now, and so far I have been extremely impressed with their quality for the price. This is definitely the best value you can get for a 7.1 system unless you go for the 400-500 dollar systems like the Creative Giga Works or similar. They do surround sound in gaming extremely well, for games like CS: Source, Unreal Tournament 2004, F.E.A.R., and Quake 4. For music, if you have the Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS the mixing and sound quality is just fine. Overall, for under $100 dollars, these speakers are hands down the best 7.1 system you can find on the market"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Garmin Magnetic/Suction Mount Antenna,This product lets me keep my Garmin 2820 on center council of my SUV and I get great reception.  I highly recommend this product.

electronics,,1.0,Product stopped working,"The first unit worked OK for about a month but then just stopped transmitting, if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about 5 minutes and then stop again. Returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in 2 weeks. Returned second unit for credit and will buy something else. Both units had a lot of static, even at low to moderate volume level"

Now I can really *hear* my music!"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,"Very fast, once you get it to work","This D-Link wireless 802.11g wireless AirPlusXtremeG adapter is amazing. The first amazing thing, is that it seems to lose your connection all the time. This seems to be because of some problem D-link has with ""Authentication"". If you want yours to work, turn off authentication. Once you have it running reliably, it is amazingly fast. I run on a cable modem and get about 1.1 megabytes per second on a wired connection normally, and yet I have exceeded that with my AirPlusXtremeG (about 1.15). My point is that it works like a wired connection without the hassle of wires, but with the added hassle of needing to set it up EXACTLY right. This doesn's seem to be a problem if you don't use security, but with security, be prepared to visit at least one forum for tips on set-up. I recommend [...]. They have many people who are experienced with this adapter and the routers that are used with it"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Very Reliable,"I've used the SL3100 Bluetooth headphones for over 3 months now and am very pleased with them. I waited awhile before writing a review because of my experience with the Logitech Bluetooth headphones for the Ipod. I wrote a glowing review for those in mid-2005 after I had them for a couple of weeks only to have them break on me a few weeks later. I subsequently replaced them two additional times only to experience repeated breakings of the head band. When I received the SL3100s I quickly put them through all the situations in which the Logitech headphones broke (carry-on luggage, falling asleep while wearing them etc.) yet they have failed to break. I think Creative has a winner here. I only wish Creative could make them a little sleeker. Other than that they look a little floppy, they have good battery life, good range and easily sync up for use with my Ipod, TV and PSP."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Worked great for a couple of days....,"I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,great little versatile unit!,"I found this to be the perfect balance between portability and car usage. It's bright enough and colorful in the car, yet small enough to carry around with you on a hiking trail. It takes a while to get a signal when it's starting cold, however, after that, say, if you turn it off to run into a gas station and then come right back out, it pops right up. Looses signal when amongst tall skyscrapers and under heavy duty forested trees, but I still gave it a 5 star review because that is to be expected."

electronics,,4.0,No problems with this modem,"The modem has worked fine since I set it up.  The instructions for setting it up were somewhat confusing, but I made it through.  I am not a tech professional, but just a residential end-user.  I got it working with minimal effort even though the instructions could have been somewhat better in my opinion.  I had a US Robotics hard-wired modem prior to this one, and I believe they are fairly comparable in terms of set-up and operation"
electronics,,1.0,not appropriate for a touch typist,"The keyboard is inexpensive and probably fine unless you are a touch typist. Then it has a few quite annoying quirks, such as backspace key is too small, and the set of Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown has an extra row of keys on a top. Somehow it gets quite annoying when you type fast and type a lot. So, after using this keyboard for about a week, I'll be returning it back. I'll be getting Dell USB keyboard instead."
electronics,,5.0,Excellent transaction,Very fast delivery and exactly as ordered.  Can't be better than that
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Great headphones for air travel,"I do quite a bit of flying, and these have been a real boon. Much less expensive - especially since I bought a refurbished pair - and smaller and more portable than the Bose headphones. These have made it much easier to enjoy my iPod inflight - I only wish I didn't have to turn it off for takeoff and landing"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Great speaker system for the price,"I bought this speaker system a year ago and now it still works fine! The sound quality isn't that bad as some previous reviews stated. On the contrary, high is clear and bass is decent, mid-range is not that vivid though. But, wait, what do you expect for such a tiny little system. It's stylish as well IMHO. I really enjoy it.

electronics,4 of 4,4.0,It DOES work with Palm,It seems like the last reviewer forgot that this card doesn't come with any software.it will not work straight out from the box &you will need to get a GPS software. It works with my Tungsten T3 using Mapopolis and the add on file from igolf. With the right software this card works just fine for what it is suppose to do! Not having more choices in the current market it's hard to do comparison tho'
electronics,,4.0,Great protection,"This is a well-made, sturdy case that I am happy to have purchased. I use my Nano in the car and for running. I have a FM transmitter cradle in the car and a arm band for running. I use this case to protect my Nano when traveling, at the pool, and transporting it to the car or into work. It provides a durable, classy and protective shield around my Nano to protect it from scratches or damage in my pocket or laptop bag. You can easily access it with the flap open and use it with headphones. You do have to remove the Nano in order to access the data port but thats no issue for me"
electronics,24 of 25,5.0,iQue 3600 is the best GPS deal out there!,"The best deal out there for GPS in my ever-so-humble opinion is a refurbished Garmin iQue 3600. It comes with Maps for the whole USA or Europe depending on the version. It comes with a cradle that sits on your dashboard (a bit tight on my 2006 Vibe, but workable) whose power plug goes into your cigarette lighter socket, and includes a nice and loud speaker. The screen is big enough for my uses."
electronics,,5.0,Best. Mouse. Ever.,"Well I wouldn't go quite so far as to say that, but it's close enough. I was quite happy with my Razer Diamondback, but it was just a little bit too small for my hand. The G5 fixed that minor ergonomic problem for me, and its system for on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment is easier to use."

electronics,,5.0,Quick  20 minute set-up ......really!!!!!!,"I wasted a whole week trying to install a Linksys router. Their tech support was very helpful but there's not much that can be done when the product is so bad. So I wouldn't go blame tech-support which seems to be the predominant complaint among the disgruntled. Never thought an accent was an impediment to getting good service. I've really never had any problems w/tech support from anywhere outside the US and in fact most of my problem have been with US based customer and technical support. In any event,  I exchanged that Linksys for this Netgear router and its a joy setting this up. I ran the CD and it was COMPLETELY automated. Very satisfying after the nonsense I was going through trying to make that Linksys router to work. No wonder CIsco - who owns Linksys - is languishing in its stock evaluation. These people make lousy products. I couldn't even update software w/o difficulty. I currrently have 2 wireless computers and a wired desk-top hooked into this router. Additionally, it is aesthetically pleasing and a so much better than the Linksys product which look like it was designed by Klingons!! Thank you Netgear you folks are the best. PS: I used to use an older Linksys 802.11b router that worked just fine....then again that was manufactured during the pre-Cisco ownership era"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great addition to a great camera,I recently ordered this for a week long trip I was planning to Olympic National Park.  WOW what a great find.

I can't speak for the software that came with it, as I use Picasa2 and don't want to change. It IS Photosmart, I somtimes make a mistake and have the wrong size paper selected...this printer will not print unless things are OK.  I mostly print 4X6, and the handy holder for this size stores in the top of the unit.  Don't tell HP, but I refill the ink, so this is a budget saving printer.  For less than $100, you can't go wrong.  Amazon delivered it in a couple days even with free shipping.  I would buy another."

electronics,2 of 3,1.0,Worst quality and lackluster warranty,"This is by far the poorest quality DVD+R DL on the market.  Failure rate is about 75%.  Memorex contracted these discs out to CMC Magnetics.  Please don't confuse CMC with MCC, which is top of the line and belongs to Verbatim.  These discs will fail in the burn and give CRC, bad sectors, unable to read, invalid type, and other various error codes.  If you like expensive coasters, then these are the brand for you.  If you want quality DL media with extremely low compression artifacts and nice effortless burns, then go with Verbatim."
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,"Questionable reliability, lacking interface","This product functioned well for about 3 years when it cost about 3 to 4 times what it costs now. Unfortunately, the all the connections had been so unreliable that we bought a new (ethernet only) router, despite performing several power cycles and days of troubleshooting."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,These are great!,"These speakers I just got are perfect for my dorm in college.  They have a good sound quality and they save alot of room, I would recommend this for anyone who lives in a college dorm room"
electronics,4 of 10,1.0,BAAAAAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,Like the phone up to a couple of days ago.
electronics,,4.0,Decent mouse for the money,"This mouse plays great for my games like CS Source and 1942. It is real nice to be able to change the mouse speed in game. Which helps a lot if your playing games like 1942 and you need to go from first person to flying a jet. However the reason I give it a 4 stars is that after playing for a few hours the mouse's design is such that it has a sharp bend right where your right ring finger rests and it can get to be hurting, especially if you play a lot of FPS type games where your holding and moving the mouse constantly"
electronics,,1.0,Save you money,This item was not functional.  The Model 700 would not completely fit into the sleeve even if you removed the antenna.  An inexpensive camera case would be more appropriate for the job.  Before I bought my GPS I rented a car from Dollar who had Garmin products.  Their case was perfect.  Too bad Magellan can't produce one
electronics,11 of 11,4.0,A step up from motherboard audio.,"I noticed a lack of positive reviews for this product, based on its rather exclusive compatibility: it only works for Windows. And that doesn't help much, but if you are a Windows user (including XP; that was apparently a problem with older SB Live! cards) who uses the common Intel chipset and would like better sound without spending a lot of money, I would recommend this."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,USB Extension Cable,I received my USB extension cable quick and it was just what I needed since my printer is on the opposite side of the desk from my computer. The price was so much better after looking around locally and comparing different web sites.  I would difinitely do it again.
electronics,1 of 4,4.0,base + handset review,"Performs well with good range.  No answer machine, which I didn't realize when purchased"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Works great!!! .. around the house, at work, in airplane",I read the previous mixed reviews here and was somewhat concerned about getting these ... but I always wanted wireless headphones so I gave them a try. Let me address some of the issues that have been raised:
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Must have fixed previous problems . . . ,"I was hesitant to purchase based on some of the early reviews but DLO must have taken the feedback and fixed the problems listed in the earlier reviews.  The model I received has S-Video out and has excellent sound quality when I connect it to my A/V Amp.  The music menus appear on the TV - which is exactly what I wanted.  You have to toggle modes on the remote from ""iPod"" to ""DLO"" if you want to display pictures, slideshows or video, but in the ""DLO"" mode, the music menus are on the TV.  I have not played videos or slide shows, but the music menu picture quality is good.  Good quality cables (no S-Video cable included) and good product quality.  Great product that I would absolutely recommend. "
electronics,,5.0,Mega connection availability ...,Easy and brainless installation!
electronics,,4.0,Good Product for price with only a few cons,"I looked around for cases for my Sansa e280 MP3 Player, and this product was a bargain for the stuff you get with it. Overall this product has worked great and I am very satisfied with it. The case for the player fits and protects the player very well. The black leather is nice and works well. Unfortunately, the case makes the buttons somewhat harder to push with the case on, especially the menu/on/off button, covers the key lock (fortunately its under the velcro strap of the case, so its pretty easy to access it anyway), and makes it a little harder to plug in stuff to the headphone jack, but these are just small annoyances. The screen protector protects the screen very well and does not alter the screen image in any noticable way. Even though I could not get all the bubbles out of the screen protector, I was lucky to get none in the viewing area. The larger traveling case is very nice, and can fit the player, my headphones, and the computer connector fairly well, and protects all of them well. The screen cleaning cloth works as it should. They only thing I don't like about this product are the belt clips on the cases. The belt clips are pretty much useless since you have to take off your belt to remove the MP3 Player from your belt, if you even wear one. Overall, though, for the price and everything you get for it, this product is hard to beat."
electronics,,5.0,for the price,I just bought this unit and so far I like it. The soound is very good along with the picture. I will try the HDMI when I can find a cord. For some reason the cord is hard to find. Back to the unit.... the remote takes some time to talk to the unit but I think this was a good buy. As soon as I plug in the HDMI I'll get back to you all.
electronics,,4.0,"Light, thin fan that does the trick","These fans are thin and light and made completely of plastic.  They are easy to move, have multi-speeds,and have enough power to cool down a large room.  We bought two and like it that they work well and are easy to store"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great Product!,"I purchased these headphones at a great price, and they have great sound quality with great noice cancelling ability. Of course, not every single sound is muted completely as one might expect. They still do a fantastic job of keeping unwanted outside noices from affecting the wonderfull sound quality produced by these headphones. They work great at home, in the car, and when I cut the grass. They also can produce a lot of sound on low sound settings saving me battery life on my mp3 player. The only thing that may affect wether you would want these or not is the fact that they are in ear. If you don't like in ear headphones for the fact that you can hear your movements at times, then these might not be for you. I personally think they are great, though!"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,phone,the key pad doesn't light up which we find helpful when it does.
electronics,1 of 4,4.0,Good-comfortable earphones,"I purchased this as a gift but the recipient was well pleased and probably would give it a four, at least"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Sure they're expensive, but .....","Sure, the price is high - there's no doubt about that. Anyways, being in the electronics industry, I had two thoughts before I wanted to plunk down this much money for cables: "
electronics,,5.0,DVD ,The DVD's seem to work just fine. They are required by the Manufacturerer or would void the warrenty. And we have had no problems with performance since we began using them
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,"Nice design, but bad response time","The anycom mouse is a very nice looking design and the docking charger works well, but it is driving me nuts with it's slow response time.  I end up having to click twice on almost everything.  It is as if the rate  that it's sending information to the computer is slow, so it doesn't sense a click unless you hold the button down for an extra moment.  Fine if you work like that, but not if you're used to a regular mouse response."
electronics,,4.0,Great form factor - reliable performer (so far...),"Got the device to use in the crowded radio spectrum of Washington DC.  Even channels with known broadcasts worked well in two different cars. Location and orientation within the car can make a difference - as do car antenna type - my experience is that cars with mast antennas seems to work more reliably than cars with in-window antennas - though I can't explain why.  May just be a radio sensitivity issue.  Wish the frequency band went lower than 88.1 Mhz, as the spectrum is usually less crowded in the lower frequencies.  Audio level output adjustment is missing. Display, though small, is usable."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A lot of space at a great price,This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.
electronics,,4.0,Good little product,"Worked well and sound quite acceptable. Would be good if they allowed ""even number"" FM stations - only odd number frequencies available but doesn't seem to be a serious problem. Also the dock connection could have been more like the standard Apple connector and would have more easily fit through my iPod case. However, these are minor reservations and overall I found this to be good value for the money"
electronics,,4.0,"compact, kind of a battery eater",fits perfectly with the original nano...sticky part on the back loses its stickiness (i dont know how to get it sticky again)...great range...eats up battery (expected)...protective bag leaves TONS of lint all over the nano :P...multiple settings are great...takes a while to get used to how the menu work
electronics,6 of 10,5.0,Terrific Sound Improvement!!,"For some time, I had been reluctant to switch to coaxial digital cables. I figured I was getting good sound with the optical cable which I paid [price] for, and why should I spend another [price] for digital coaxial cable. Last week I switched to Monster Cable IDL 100 Interlink Datalink 100 coaxial digital cable and now my optical cable is collecting dust in my garage. The difference in the sound is incredible!!! This Interlink 100 cable eliminated ""sound inpurities"" and turned it into a much crispier, detailed sound. The bass from the subwoofer is crystal clear and powerful but without the ""puffy""/distorted bass. dvd players have both connection options in the back. Some new models have only the digital coaxial option. Buy this Interlink 100 and experience the difference yourself. You will not be sorry you switched. I give this product two thumbs up!!"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Great Flash Drive,I was amazed at how easy to use this Flash Drive was.  Simply a matter of plugging it in and treating it like another disk.  I use it to back up important files and for transfering files from one computer to another. Glad I ordered it
electronics,,5.0,"Responsive, Ergonomic and Sexy","Had tried other (including Logitech) cordless mice, but they were either too large and impractical to use with laptop in small space, or too small and my fingers extended far beyond the click buttons.  This one is perfect - and just as responsive (though parameters can be adjusted) as a corded optical mouse.  REALLY like the fact that the transmitter clicks into the bottom of the mouse and shuts power off when you do - only minor quibble is that the transmitter does not fit completely into the body of the mouse when clicked in, so doesn't sit level when attached to bottom.  Great product - simple, stylish and performs perfectly.   "
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,They only lived for 16 months,Do not buy.  Sounded great but died just past the warranty period of 1 year.  Klipsch has yet to respond to support questions after one week.  Definitely no repeat business from me
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best for the money!,All around basic cordless phone with basic features. Perfect for someone needing the freedom from a cord
electronics,,5.0,Nasty Mouse for Gaming.,Nothing better for 1st person gaming with the sensitivity adjust on the mouse and the asjustable weight ...
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,A pretty good clock!,"We got this alarm clock for my 8-year-old daughter, who has loved it for the last year.  She was even able to figure out how to set the times, so I really don't understand the difficulty others have had.  The nature sounds are a little strange sounding and have a rather short loop, but she likes it enough to listen to it while falling asleep at night.  It has worked so nicely that I got one for myself.  It's much more pleasant to wake up to the sounds than a blasting radio or alarm.  The sound quality isn't as good as an $80 alarm clock with real sounds, but for the money, it's not bad"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent product,I used 4 way splitter (3 TVs + cable) and got to add 2 more TVs. Decided to try this 8-way splitter. Very good results: 5 TVs (including 1 HDTV) and cable (giving over 5mps) work fine
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Value for money,"Its a nice cam, you probably wont expect anything more than this for this much money. The quality sometimes depends on the internet speed. Didn't try the photo feature."
electronics,5 of 8,2.0,Next-generation Harmony remote not much better than the previous generation,"This is my second Harmony remote, after I started to have problems with my Harmony 680 shortly after the warranty was up (I also reviewed this remote in detail on Amazon)."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Pretty useful product,"You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Best case for Palm Z22,I actually bought this item as a temporary case the day I bought my Palm Z22 because it was the only one the store had for this model. I ended up really liking it though so now its the case I use everyday. Many people wrote hard to open and get open but its not hard at all. As far as getting the Palm out since the stylus and charge/sync plug is accessible while the palm is in it there is really no reason to take it out (which isn't too difficult if you wanted to anyway). I just gently flip the cover up and use it while it stays in there. Definately a great case. Even if it gets scratched which mine hasn't yet you flip the cover up so it doesnt matter. I like the way it looks too
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great Purchase,The splitter was easy to install and the cable signal did not weaken.  I am very pleased with my purchase and would buy again
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Dash Mount with 12V Adapter for iQue M5,The iQue M5 comes with a suction cup mount that I didn't care for. This kit enables me to use the existing mount bases I had already installed in my car & truck from my GPS V and gives me the friction mount to use in a rental while traveling. Using this mount with my existing bases I can get the iQue in more user friendly positions. Anyone want to buy a suction cup mount
electronics,6 of 8,1.0,Left analog stick loses calibration,"Do not buy this product. Like many other people who purchased this product, my left stick loses calibration, making the gamepad worthless"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Amazon = Deals,"The number of complaints regarding Amazon is amazing and unfair.  All you need to do is read carefully and you won't ""get screwed"" . . . . be aware of where you are going.  Are you still on Amazon or have you clicked-off onto another site?  Like the young lady from New England, USA, I also get my orders shipped free, and that's on top of the discounted prices.  I'm more than happy!"
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,Awesome device....,"I purchased this phone to be used with a VoIP line. I have found no distorsion, no buzzing or any noise whatsoever.  Range is quite awesome considering that my house is made of cement blocks not wood. I can be anywhere and have a clear reception."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Buy the HP version!,"First of all, I bought one of these a couple of years ago, I thought it was terrible and returned it."
electronics,,1.0,It makes coffee!!??,"Had it for a couple of months........sent it back.   Carafe couldn't keep coffee warm over 20 mins, even with preheating it with hot water.  Coffee flavor wasn't great and the entire product was cheaply made; it shouldn't sell for a dime over $29.95.  They should stick with rice and bread"
electronics,,5.0,Yeah it's REALLY tough - saved my iPod TWICE,"I have a 60gig iPod photo. I have (yipes!)dropped my iPod more than once with the ToughSkin attached. The iPod survived 4ft and 5ft drops to a hardwood floor! The only warning I have for this item is that once you put the ToughSkin on, LEAVE IT ON!! Otherwise, the rubber will stretch and not fit properly. So if you're planning on using the iPod with a docking station, don't bother purchasing ths type of case"
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Remanufactured = Brand spankin' new,"I was skeptical in purchasing remanufactured headphones with nightmares of earwax, hair and sweat stains on the ear cushions.  I was amazed at what I received!  The headphones look and smell brand new.  The sound is amazing compared to my Sony fontopia E81s and Apple earbuds.  I travel a lot and the noise reduction sure helped throughout the flight and comfort was excellent, too.  Try wearing earbuds for a 14hour flight and your ear canal will be tender. "
electronics,1 of 3,1.0,Thought this must be the one ...,"... but it's not. It's a nice, stylish design. Very sturdy and it is positive (and necessary) to have the option to dial in any frequency in the given range. However, music sounds muffled and audiobooks sound like muffled 'from outer space'. Does not work for me, just does not cut it because of the poor sound quality. This product may still be better than others because of the quality look and features. In my opinion this transmitter like others would have to be much stronger. So if your only alternative to singing the songs yourself is a FM transmitter, then this appears to be a good choice - if you expect for $50 more than 1930 radio quality, FM transmitters are not your way to go currently"
electronics,8 of 9,1.0,Never worked,The unit never worked. It kept loosing the video signal and there was no way to recover. HP support had no solution. Also HP hid the customer support phone number (you won't find it any of the documentation). The email support was only marginally better. Web discussions of the product indicated that the unit has trouble overheating; I kept cool and it still crashed. The software wasn't much better--it continually hung.
electronics,23 of 26,1.0,Dont waste your money,I bought this drive because of its high speed and good look. As one of the reviewer pointed out the the joints are made of poor quality material and it came off within a month and soon it will be unusable. I am returning it
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,Sure they're cute BUT......,"Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE!"

electronics,,4.0,Good Quality,"The sound is good quality, but I had a couple of issues with this headset."
electronics,,4.0,Bose Universal Floor Stands,"The best price that I could find for these.  These were easy to assemble.  I previously had wall mounts, but the sound from my Bose speakers is so much better with these stands, away from the wall.  They are relatively unobtrusive and easy to move around as needed"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,"Good Product, but not compatible with other accessories","I bought the belkin tunedok for use in our car.  The variety of cup sizes ensures that you will be able to find a size that works for your car.  It would be nice if Belkin offered other colors, since our car has a tan interior....the light gray color seemed like a real comprimise...it likely won't exactly match anyone's interior."
electronics,,5.0,JBL SUB,Excellent bass for room size 15 x 12. Used in home cinema system with 92 inch screen and Sanyo projector. Good control of volume and crossover points. Very satisfied for under 300 bucks. Can't beat it
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great little mp3 player!,I bought this for my husband when he gave his old iRiver to our son. The 512 MB capacity has proven to hold more that enough songs for several hours of listening pleasure and it is quite easy to download the songs to from the computer. I would recommend it to anyone. The only drawback to it is if you have large music files and need more storage capacity than this will hold. I went ahead and got the 1G for myself. But iRiver is very user-friendly
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Great Little Gizmo,This device is perfect for playing my MP3 player at work and can be easily packed to use on trips.  I am especially impressed with the set of international power plugs as I travel overseas
electronics,8 of 13,1.0,Disaster with an iron,"Don't try to use this product with an HP printer, or using a dark t-shirt. I used a simple two tone image printed with a HP Photosmart 7660. While the image on the paper was clear when printed, and I was able to get the paper aligned correctly prior to printing, the final product was horrible. When I peeled back the paper what was left on the dark green shirt was a mess. The image was dim, the residue that remained on the shirt looked like some sort of disease. The final result was the creation of three paint rags, since the images were so bad I wouldn't even wear them to take out the trash. If you need to have a few custom shirts take your image to a local printer and don't bother with this product. What you waste in ruined shirts more than offsets the cost of having the job done right."
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,Good System - Recommended,I purchased the Sony DAV-FX100W system over the internet.  It surprisingly arrived in only a few days. Assembly and wiring instructions were done well.  It looks good and matches well with my Sony HDTV.  
electronics,,5.0,Excellent product for Sony,This is an excellent and unexpensive memory stick for Sony Cybershot Camera. I was confused that I could not find explanation if it is good for my Sony Cybershot or not- it fits perfectly and is half price compared to Sony memory stick. performs the same

Then it started to malfuntion with the ""dirty disc"" message so I switch to Sony DVD-R and that stopped.  But, then it started to not read and burned discs at all. Now it won't read ANY disc and the dics that I burned from old tapes won't play on ANY machines. I'm glad I saved all my old tapes."

electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Works like a charm!,"I mainly use this to back up my accounting system, and so far, I've had no problems with it at all.  My Windows XP system installed it immediately, and I was using it within the next 2 or so minutes.  It's lightweight, comes with a neck cord and 3 different color caps (light blue, light pink and clear) to protect the USB connector.  It's just big enough to not easily lose and small enough to carry around conveniently."

electronics,,4.0,Seems to work just fine,"I have nothing to compare them to, but I bought 3 of these and they seem to do the job they are intended to do.  I was surprised to see no savings on shipping when I ordered 3 vs ordering 1 at a time, although I am now clear on the policy.  They still were a bargain, as far as I have compared.  I would buy again, from the same vendor"
electronics,,5.0,Great Product,"We had purchased a DVD recorder and within 5/6 months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor, I contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last 5/6 months."
electronics,,5.0,Superb value,"This little printer is one of the best investments I've ever made. It is light, fast, and does a superb job. Even printing high resolution photographs is first-rate. If I have one criticism it is that the ink cartrridges do not have a larger capacity. But, they are so inexpensive that it is no effort to have many of them in reserve. Great product"
electronics,63 of 69,1.0,Tivo Users Beware,"I purchased 2 D-Link DWL-G120 802.11g adapters from Amazon through Office Depot to use on two Tivo DVR's. I wanted the extra speed of these adapters, which were the only 802.11g adapters recommended by Tivo. I bought them specifically to make use of the Tivo To Go features that allows you to watch a show on one Tivo that was recorded on another one via the network and to transfer recordings from a Tivo to my PC.  Neither feature worked with these adapters.  If you read the Tivo website carefully, you will see they recommend D-Link DWL-G120 version B2.  The Amazon website did not indicate what version was being sold.  I was shipped the B1 version and they keep losing the connection whenever I try to transfer recordings from one Tivo to the other or to my PC.  A Tivo person on their community forum verified that a different chipset is on the B2 and that the B1 causes hangups and freezes like what I experienced.  "

electronics,12 of 20,1.0,A Triumph of Marketing Hype,"Make no doubt, this system looks beautiful, but Bose sells what they make, rather than make what they sell.

electronics,,4.0,Does what it says it will do...,"First of all, I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a ""throw back to the seventies"" in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,When they first came out paid $80 !! ,"  Yes thats right ,I wanted one so bad ,that I ran to the closest Best Buy and purchased the 256MB at $80. It kills me that I can buy this same drive for around $16. Its amazing while home and car prices soar, when it comes to PC's and anything you attach to it ,they continue to have more features for a cheaper price .I have not used this drive alot ,however when ever I did it never gave me any trouble except for the first time I plugged it into my PC which at that time was a P3 750mhz .PNY said for WinMe and WinXP it was plug and play ,which would probably be true unless you had a OEM install of your O/S and who ever installed it did not include all of the drivers for USB interface .I was able to extract the additionial files from the install .cab folders on my hard drive,and once it as up and runing ,I would just drag and drop what ever file or folder I needed to take with me,without any probs !"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Get  these headphones the right way,"First,these phones are great but I want them in black.Now if you don't get a good ear seal they will sound horrible.The treble is silky,the mids are natural and the bass is tight,well defined and deep.I should know bass,I'm a bass player of 40 years and it's like being at a live show.Amazon sells these for $73 with nextday shipping.Get yours NOW.They take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price,it's the best deal out there.The sound quality is amazing.My sony 71s are history.Enjoy from Bassin J."
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,Not for etrex models,"This case is not for etrex models, it's huge. You could put two GPS in it."
electronics,,5.0,Nice keyboard by MS...,"I picked this keyboard up for about 20 dollars, along with the Comfort Optical Mouse 3000- separately."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Good batteries, great price.",I bought three boxes of these and have had great success with them.  I can't tell the difference between these and Duracell's or Energizers.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I will buy some more
electronics,,4.0,"Failed, but quickly received a replacement","This flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months.  I used Viking's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response.  They offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed, they gave me an RMA to ship it back for a replacement.  I had a new one within a week, no hassle, no fees (other than the $1.50 to mail it back to them).  "
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,A Monster of a Cable.,"Well, actually I bought this nice cable, at Amazon Marketplace great offering that it was, for an HDTV Tuner, which bombed in my neighborhood. So, I never did get to unpack the cable. But it's in the closet, and it knows it's a good cable. Great cable, @ great price, thru Amazon"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Saving my marriage,My wife likes to watch Barbara Striesand movies.  Some of them I don't enjoy.  I like to watch things she doesn't enjoy.  With the ear phones we can each enjoy our evenings without disturbing the other one. 
electronics,8 of 23,1.0,They should stick to just memory,"The software on this MP3 player is as buggy as they come.  I've never been able to get the Sansa Media Converter to recognize my Sansa e250. Consequently, I've never been able to add pictures or videos to my player.  This is despite 7 sets of correspondences with their help desk.  Their most helpful suggestion was for me to try to sync to a different Windows XP machine.  Yeah, I'm going to buy a new PC because they can't figure out how to test their software before releasing it to the public."
electronics,,5.0,Great Little TV,I bought this tv for placing in front of a treadmill. We use it with a direct cable feed. It was very easy to set up and use. The picture looks great and it didn't break the bank. I also like that we can take it with us camping or on the back porch when needed. It will be nice if we lose power as well to be able to use it with the batteries and keep track of school cancelations etc.
electronics,,4.0,For emergency use only.,Bought this 4 years ago and have used it twice during extended power outages.  I knew that the battery life would decrease with use so I only use it when I have to.  I think the problem with some of the people that are using the radio is that they are using it not as intended but as a cheap alternative to battery operated radios.  Recommended for people intending to use this for emergencies only but not recommended if you intend to use it often as a substitute to purchasing batteries
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,It's great and kicks *ss!,"Easy to hook up and works as advertised, now I can feel the music and live the movies! Splitter is included so you can connect subwoofer/speakers. Well worth the money"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Nice little player,"This is the first MP3 player, or maybe that should be WMA player I have even had. This type of technology is always involves some kind of compromise to make it possible to manufacture something useful that people can afford to buy, so I tend not to jump in and buy new technologies, but this machine, which could hold the contents of 600 CDs looked like something I could use."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,It works perfectly,Well it works perfectly.  What more does a person need to know
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,mdr-ds3000,"these are very good headphones for movies,for music they are just ok.The 5.1 feature on these doesnt really impress me that much and you have to have to be in front of the transmitter or you will get a lot of hiss,but for cordless headphones there better than most for the money"
electronics,3 of 9,5.0,Ninguna diferencia.,"Quiero resaltar un hecho importante. No hay ninguna diferencia con las SONY. Poseo ambas, la sony de 128MB y la Lexar de 128MB (la cual adquir a mitad de precio en una oferta de amazon) y no existe ninguna diferencia de funcionamiento entre ambas. Sin embargo creo que la diferencia de precios entre la sony original y la lexar no es significativa ($3 o $4) por lo que yo me voy por la sony. Espero sea de ayuda. (En espaol es mejor!!)"
electronics,,5.0,ViewSonic VA1912WB 19,I own this monitor for 3 months and I love it.
electronics,6 of 6,1.0,No Firefox or Windows domain support - deceptive MS marketing,"I bought this product on the cool idea that I could log on to any Web site with the use of my fingerprint. The dos say that this product ""should"" not be used in corporate networks so already I was feeling suspicious, but since the store I bought it from has a good return policy, I chose to try it out. Well, the product simply does not work if your PC a member of a Windows domain (so ""should"" as stated above is misleading). Also, as some other reviewers pointed out, if you don't use Internet Explorer (a smart thing if you care about security), then you can't use this product as it is hard-coded to work with IE this reader useless for Firefox users. This is a cool concept gone sour by stupid / stubborn product compatibility policy and bad software design."
electronics,,4.0,Excellent Product,"I am satisfied by the purchase of this Targus CVR600 15.4 Groove Notebook Backpack since it is super wide, comfortable and with many compartments to keep objects  apart of the laptop. I recommend it to you"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Great Speakers!,These are realy good speakers by Logitech. The sound is too good and nice and crisp for almost all kind of songs.
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Fantastic!,"I had purchased an Alpine CDA 9847 a few months back for my wife's minivan, which I now drive. (If I have to drive a minivan, it better have good tunes!) The salesman had mentioned that an ipod interface was available, but at the time, I didn't have an ipod and didn't think I would ever use this feature."
electronics,4 of 8,2.0,Some dvd players can't read the printable version of this brand.,The printable version of verbatim can't be read by some dvd players. I have panasonic and jvc dvd players and they can't read them. However the xbox dvd player can without a problem. 
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,6 months experience,"My experience with my 2620 has proven it to be invaluable.  It will give you a few bogus directions, but generally is right on.  Reality checks are advisable."
electronics,12 of 12,5.0,A Truly Stellar Tablet,"I have nothing but praise for this amazing little tablet.  I bought it mainly for use in conjunction with Photoshop CS2, but quickly discovered that its use extended far beyond the scope of a single program.  It was only a matter of days before I packed away my standard optical mouse; and now this tablet is the only pointing device that I use with my computer.  Simply put, I absolutely love it."
electronics,,4.0,It is what it is,"I needed an easy way to transfer data from one location to another so a jump drive was a good solution.  I needed more storage than some people due to the file sizes I deal with.  I looked at quite a few 1GB, and larger, units.  The price (under $30) was a big plus.  I don't need anything fancy like password protection or biometric encryption so the pny flash drive usb is perfect for my needs"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,HP LJ4600 Quality issues with cartridges and support,"Now we have this printer for nearly 2 years in office use, and before purchase we find that this printer has a good price per printout. But noone expected that some of the cartridges make stripy printout (with black, cyan and margenta)when the cartridge is only 50% used.... so the price per page doubles due to some misconstructed cartridges. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"It's here, it's beautiful, it's a great deal","My LCD arrived today, about a week after I ordered it. I unpacked it, plugged it in and it worked like a champ. It's a beautiful picture and a good looking monitor. There is no CD with drivers (no big deal as far as I'm concerned) so I just downloaded it from the Sceptre website. Also, the day after I ordered it for $367, the price dropped to $309. After emailing Amazon.com, they refunded me $58. I think this is a great monitor and a great deal"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,"Decent Price, Best for Quality","Sharp text for a higher price. You do get a higher page yield than other company cartridges, but I haven't got maximum yield yet either. I'm not going to try any 3rd party cartridges. Unless you're doing high page yields, stick with inkjets"
electronics,,4.0,Love it - using it now,"I love the optical mouse. It has helped my back tremedously because I am no longer reaching for my mouse to move it around. It took some getting used to but I am so glad I bought it. If you get anything remotely wet or even gummy"" on the ball it acts funny!"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Must Have for Digital Camera,These batteries are awesome. I took over 200 pictures with a Kodak 3.1 mp camera on a single charge. Batteries work great and are definitely worth  the money.
electronics,26 of 27,5.0,Most economical laser toner for small business home office.,"I Have been using Brother laser printers which use this cartridge for about 7 years. GREAT PRODUCT. In fact the Brother multi function machine I currently use is a (now discontinued) MFC 9600. It has now been replaced with the nearly identical MFC 9700. I have had it for some 5 years with regular use and it works flawlesly. I use about 3 or 4 TN460 cartridges per year. Brother seems to be about the only manufacturer which provides a decent economical value for laser toner. Yes their printers/multi function machines cost a little more initially, but, do the long term math. You pay dearly in toner costs down the road with other better known or more highly publisized brands. I am continually surprised when I inquire at any office supply store about the cost per print or cost of operation of any given laser printer. The sales people are baffled, and never seem to know. This to me is THE question to ask. And, with the cost a some excellent full featured heavy duty Brother multifunction machines (fax scanner laser printer) very close to $300, it really does not make any sense to buy anything else if you are a small business home office with fairly regular laser/fax usage. Yes you might get a laser printer for $100 less. But after a few cartridges, you will wish you had a Brother using this economical cartridge."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good case but replacement parts are expensive,The case offers very good protection for the iPod. The plastic over the screen is very good optically and doesn't degrade the picture very much. The rubber over the wheel decreases the sensitivity enough that I don't ever need to use the lock switch. I didn't bother to cut out that opening in the case.
electronics,11 of 14,5.0,need the special cable,"I have checked that this cable is the official one made by Creative.  Also, I went and tried the iPod cable as well as the A/V cable made for camcorders -- both of those won't work.  So this special cable is needed.  And if you really need to make it work before you can get a hold of the cable, see the discussion below for my posting"
electronics,,5.0,Motorola Phone Tools version 4.0,I installed this software and then used the free update from Motorola to get the latest version. The software allows me to maintain the phone directory on my PC and update it as it changes.  This was especially advantageous since my wife and I both have the same phones (v195). The software offers several other capabilities that I have not used
electronics,,4.0,Overall a great phone,I took back a RCA 2 line Phone and AT&T 2 line phone because the sound quality was terrible. 
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Better than my old Belkin model,"It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. "
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great Keyboard - I'm Using It Right Now,"I wanted to get a new keyboard to replace my Dell (which has several science projects festering below the keys), and spent a long time at Fry's going testing out the various keyboards.  I initially brought home a Logitech and decided that the letters on the keys were too small-and my wife didn't like it.  Then a couple of others felt pretty good to type on, but they turned out to be upwards of $50, chock full of buttons and nobbie thingies...I just wanted a simple keyboard."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Amazing Device,Does all that is promised in a superb and incredibly easy way. If you are a SKYPE user this is a MUST HAVE as wisely stated on CNET.  Its a blessing that comes for cheap- kind of rare now adays
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Best speakers for the Price,"I got these a while back with my Compaq monitor and I've got to say they are pretty dang decent. Their high and mids are pretty decent---slightly below par with the Logitech X-530's and their lows are rather lacking(probably due to the lack of a subwoofer). However for the price they are great, especially if you're looking to save space or just replace your moms speakers etc. They are also incredibly tough--I've dropped mine several times on hardwood floors with no problem. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Product!,"Strong and very stylish case.  Has protected my IPod from a few drops, and just looks cool.  Gives my IPod a very unique feel.  This case was the perfect case for me"
electronics,,5.0,Ink cartridge,I was glad to be able to buy this product here since it is very hard to find elsewhere - but the delivery time was long and I'm glad I didn't need it right away
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Sure they're expensive, but .....","Sure, the price is high - there's no doubt about that. Anyways, being in the electronics industry, I had two thoughts before I wanted to plunk down this much money for cables: "
electronics,,4.0,Good camera,"I've only had the opportunity to use it once or twice, but the picture was clear, and the lag wasn't bad"
electronics,,5.0,Canon goes with Canon,If you are using a Canon printer you HAVE to use Canon paper. The quality is fantastic
electronics,,5.0,My Favorites!,"I love these cases.  The colors are nice, the see-through feature is helpful, they keep my DVDs and CDs clean and are great for mailing, also.  Not one of mine has ever broken, but you DO need to open them correctly so as not to destroy them (I can't imagine any other way one would break unless you stepped on it, bent one severely, or beat one to death.)  They are made of the same type of plastic in which commercial CDs are packaged.  I always prefer to buy this exact type and brand of case"
electronics,3 of 7,1.0,Yet another pair of headphones that don't fit my head,"I bought these because I believed in them.  ""THESE are the headphones for ME!"", I said triumphantly in the store, raising them above my head as a shaft of light shone down on me from the heavens.  For the record, I'm a normal sized woman, 5'5"" with a head that is smaller than most, but certainly not abnormally small.  Not freakish or anything. So anyway."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great product,"This is a great product, very easy to set up, it works perfectly and it has plenty of features. I do have kids at home and this does bring comfort in checking them from work, from my cell phone and to have images recorded in my home computer. Objectives met 110%."
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,"Ehhh, they're ok","These headphones fit very well on my head, and the sound is good. But, mine keep dying on me (I'm now on my third pair in a year), so if you're looking for a long lasting set of headphones, you've come to the wrong place! The bass is ok in these, but it's not the greatest"
electronics,5 of 7,1.0,One word...Don't buy it!!!,My first disappointment with Palm product. I am loyal Palm customer. I am hugely disappointed with the Hard case because as said it is almost impossible to open it. Secondly not worth to buy it. 
electronics,0 of 3,1.0,The worst piece of equipment I've ever bought,"What a waste of money this product is; I've been using Linksys products exclusively for over 5 years for my home networking needs and have been very pleased with them all. This was my first negative experience, and I truly regret wasting money on it. I've had the NSLU2 for over 6 months now and it's never been reliable. It works OK as long you you're not using it (i.e. it stays up and running); it even works good with transferring one or two small files; but trying to move a large number of files (and by large I mean anything over 10-15 files) locks up both the NSLU2 and the computer the transfer is initiated from solid and required a hard boot of both. Deleting files from NSLU2 (or should I say via NSLU2) is also a crap shoot - sometimes it works and sometimes it just locks up. I'm so frustrated with it now that I'm starting to look for another alternative to replace it with and will send this one straight to the trash can as soon as I find something. Do yourself a favor and look for other options, even if they cost more - you'll just end up wasting money on this POS"
electronics,262 of 262,1.0,Prepare to fight every step of the way,"N.E.W. will waste your time, money, and your every last nerve before repairing your product.  Eventually they will, but not without an exhausting, protracted fight"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Love it,"I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous.  I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so!  I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move.  Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though.  Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,I have been using this phone for over a year now. Excellent!,Solid product with exceptional features. The sound quality is exceptional and the battery life is pretty good. Overall it is a stylish phone and at a very good price
electronics,,5.0,Radio Your Way - Everything I hoped it would be,"This item is great.  I find that the AM antenna does not work too well in the parking garage, but otherwise the radio does everything I need it to do.  Buy a 1 GB Sandisk memory chip for $30 and this is like a 1GB I-pod only it has radio which allows you to do time shifting.  I record talk radio while I am at work and listen to it at night.  Also, I record FM radio at 3:00 AM when the commercials are not quite as prevalent (I have not actually run any experiments on this but it seems to be true).  I was afraid that all the menus would be too complicated and it would be difficult to figure out all the features, but I find that I use the thing enough to remember how to do the things I want to do.  Once you get into the routine of doing the timed recordings it is easy.  It is also not that difficult to figure out the menu path to take if you want to do things like recording with the microphone like an old cassette player/recorder.  I would recommend this if you are looking for an ipod that also lets you timeshift AM and FM."
electronics,,4.0,Scansnap lives up to expectations for this MAC user.,"I am rapidly digitizing my world & cleaning my desk of clutter saving all sizes of scraps of paper as well as standard size sheets of paper up to 8.5x14"".  I love it and am telling all my friends.  Its only week link is scaning stacks of multiple sheets of paper which have been stapled (after staples have been removed) or are irregular in some manner.  More than one page may go through together.  The scanner recognizes this & stops scanning until reloaded.  Software is 4 out of five & very easy to use.  Scanning can be done at 5 levels of resolution.  4 works very well for pages which may need to be reprinted in the future at high resolution"
electronics,2 of 5,4.0,Also useful for 48V DC POE devices,Appears to implement 802.3af Power Over Ethernet (POE) standard in full.  Marked down because the documentation supplied and available on Linksys web site is so dismal.
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,I can't believe anyone sign's up a 2nd time for this garbage!,I can't believe Echostar/Dish Network can stay in business the way their customer service must be hemorrhaging subscribers. They must rely on getting new ones because I can't believe anyone would re-up for their abuse.
electronics,,5.0,Lite On Is  Right On,"The best burner out there.  Can handle any sort of disc with aplomb and no coasters.  Lite On is so much better than other better known brands, but they're getting more famous by the moment"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Uniden TRU9485-2 Expandable Cordless System,Very pleased with the phone and all the features.  Easy setup and use
electronics,,5.0,New cartridge at very resonable price.,Why go through the hassle of buying refilable cartridges when you can get new ones at this price
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great Product... Can't beat the deal!,Thank you so much for providing a quality product. I had purchased a 1GB MiniSD SanDisk card from BestBuy for $75.00 and then looked online and found a 2GB MiniSD SanDisk card on Amazon for only $40!!! Nearly half the price for twice the spice.
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Amazing,"This is an absolutely amazing product by the guys at alpine.  Having all 6500 songs (and counting) in my car at all times is a dream come true.  If you have a compatible alpine cd player, get this so you never have to lug a bunch of cd's in your car ever again"
electronics,,1.0,Review of DP-G321 Wireless-G Print Server,The installation documentation is totally inadequate.  Was only able to get a glimmer of the problems by checking online other reviews of the product.  After spending over 8 hours trying to get  a satisfactory setup I decided to send it back. Printer port names and addressing are the main issues.  Don't understand why D-Link would not sort this installation documentation problem out.  It appears to have been going on since 2003 or earlier
electronics,1 of 3,2.0,"Very flaky, contrary to Viking's reputation for quality","I've owned various Viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance, until I purchased this 2 GB CompactFlash card.  "
electronics,,5.0,Quality Bose Product as Advertised,I was very impressed with the quality of the Bose Speaker Stands I purchased from Amazon.  Shipping was fast and accurate.  I would not hesitate to purchase again from Amazon
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Mine looks different from the one pictured,"I don't usually write reviews on here, but I thought I should since this product seems to have a bad rap. I ordered mine through ""Speedyretailer"" through Amazon. I think they were like $3.50 or something and shipping was more than the actual product. I got them and they are actually more than I expected from reading the reviews on here. I find it easier to hit the buttons now, but mine are different than the one pictured. The Silicone on mine covers the buttons and has the buttons stamped on it and you just press through the silicone. I find it much easier even though I was getting used to manuvering and clicking the buttons. It fits perfectly and yes it collects a little crud on it, but it is silicone...DUH! It's not too hard to wipe off. It even comes with a belt hook you can install or keep off. I'm totally satisfied"
electronics,32 of 32,5.0,Amazed -= great sound with a terrific price,I wasn't expecting much from these speakers. I guess I'm old school and used to think you needed to spend $1000/pr for speakers with decent sound quality.
electronics,,5.0,remote keyboard and mouse,the wireless keyboard and mouse were easy to set up and utilize.  It has an outstanding touch and easy to use
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,How Did  I Live Without It?,"This wireless mouse is awesome!  I love the right click feature, scrolling and ability to use expose just by squeezing the edges.  I do Windows for work through a Citrix client and some of the commands require right clicks.  This mouse does it no problem--and you sacrifice none of the Apple aesthetics.  It also works on the surface of my dining room table, which used to trip up other lesser laser mice, including apple's one button wireless mouse."
electronics,,4.0,Compatibility issues,"I bought these headphones to be used with the LG Chocolate which supposedly supports stereo bluetooth headsets.  They are incompatible.  I do not know if this is the fault of Jensen, LG, or Verizon, (a combination of all 3 is likely) but I'm kind of peeved that I paid all that money for something that won't work for my intended purpose.  I thought the whole point of Bluetooth is that it's supposed to be a ""standard?""  My phone would recognize the bluetooth headset, but that's about all it would do.  Both LG and Verizon weren't helpful, and I couldn't even find Jensen to ask about it."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,I'm not returning this.,At first when I received this webcam I was a little disappointed. It seemed a bit blurry and I wasn't sure why. After adjusting the lens a little bit I could finally see everything clearly.
electronics,,5.0,"One of BEST CRT ""tube"" TVs out there.","I got this baby in late 2004 I've been in love with it since. Today, due to a move and much larger living room I'm retiring this sexy baby for a 50-inch plasma (I still feel the pain). "
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,great dock,This little dock works well.  I already have the charger that came with the ipod (and the firewire lead) so I used that to charge it.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,No problems here,"The only errors I got with this entire spindle were caused by files that were actually corrupt on my hard drive, I couldn't even access them directly on the hard drive.  Not one of these disks caused me a problem, and I am buying another spindle of them"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Headset W/Microphone Boom,"I must admit I was somewhat apprehensive about buying anything off the internet, I had heard so many stories against it. I was really impressed with the speed in which my product arrived and the quality of the product. I will definitely purchase from Amazon again in the future and will do so with confidence that I will get what I pay for and a product that I can depend on. Keep up the good work Amazon.com"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works well,"What can you really say about these things...make sure you get a good seal in the ears, the correct size is needed for proper fit and comfort.  Try a few different sizes and types to see which you prefer, keep extras on hand for other people"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,very happy (saw elsewhere more expensive),I've been very happy with this surge protector. One thing you should know though is it comes in white not black as shown.  The two different sizes of outlets are very handy as  you can use the smaller for regular plugs and the larger for items with larger connectors - and each can be closed if not in use.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,In its day...it was on top.,"I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)  "
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,"Horrible, tinny sound","Being a bit picky, I don't normally get something like this without being able to try it first, but I decided for the price, and based on the generally positive reviews here, I'd give them a try.  I didn't expect to have any problems with them other than fit."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Almost perfect,"CaseLogic has set the standard for media storage, and this continues the tradition. A few tweaks are needed, however. I am certain that I will soon fill the 20 slots. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk. The graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed. Actually, I would prefer that the DVD companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around"
electronics,,5.0,Portable XM Player ,Could not be more satisfied. Filled the need for being able to listen to my XM outside my car.
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,"Worked great at first, till it only started taking left turns...","I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,SAVES ONE EXTRA STEP,"WHEN THE PHONE RINGS IT PICK UP HANDSET.BE VERY CAREFUL AND PATIENT ITS GETS VERY SENSITIVE.AND DOESN'T WORK ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU ARE ANSWERING THE PHONE ONE AFTER ANOTHER.I ALSO FOUND OUT IT CAME WITH TAPE SO YOU CAN MOUNT TO YOUR TELEPHONE,I USE VELCRO SO YOU CAN REMOVE IT QUICKLY"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Coby TF-DVD7100 Portable DVD Player,the Coby is everything you said it would be.  Very pleased with the ease of operation and the quick charging time of four hours. Some others are 6 or 8 hours.
electronics,,5.0,Great Headset,"Fantastic noise reduction, extremely comfortable with a great price, compare to Bose and save $260.0"
electronics,6 of 8,5.0,High Quality at a low price,"Just purchased mine about 3 wks ago. I love it. Sure there are 2 or 3 minor things that could have been improved, but for the price and the amount of songs and the other features, it is a great buy. I recommend the cheaper verion of the car adaptor"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,H10 has been an excellent MP3 Player,"I have read some of the negative reviews and agree with some of them, on a very limited basis. Most I disagree with. Maybe some of these folks have bought lemons. I bought my first H10, the red 5GB, over a year ago. Since then, for family members, I have bought:"
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,Driving worry free,"This is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I'm not maniac driver. The detection range is very good, it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won't help much, I have it turned off. Overall, it's very good detector, you will get payback if you own one. "
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Cordless Phone System,"We needed to replace a telephone and answering system, due to age of the old system. The Uniden system has proven to be a very suitable replacement. The instructions are very complete and understandable. The ringer is distinctive and quite loud. Sound quality is quite good. The only drawback is the delay between pressing a number key and the tone associated with it. Overall, we are very pleased with the phone system"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,AWSOME PICTURE AND SOUND,BOUGHT THIS ABOUT A YEAR AGO GOT IT ON SALE AT SEARS LOOKED GREAT ON DISPLAY IN THE STORE COMPARED TO ALL THE TV'S THEY HAD ON DISPLAY AND THEY HAD ALOT THE ONLY THING THAT CAME CLOSE WAS A TOSHIBA
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works great,"We just moved to a rural area of New Jersey.  We now live about 50 miles from the AM station we were trying to listen to.  This antenna works great.  Without this item we would receive static with no hint of voices, but with this item we were able to pull in the station clearly.  I must also mention that we have high tension power lines about a half a mile away from our home.  With some postioning we were able to pull in several different AM stations that were unreachable before connecting the antenna.  Very good item.  Work great"
electronics,3 of 7,1.0,Gamer's Saisuck Keyboard,"This keyboard makes you think that you will be able to read the keys in the dark?  WRONG!!!  It lights up underneath the actual keys but you can not read them.  Why they made the eclipse like that and not this one totally baffles me!  Huge mistake on Saitek's part there.  The disk that comes with it to download the drivers doesnt work.  It constantly messes with your operating software.  And what makes it the ironic keyboard you ask?  It crashes most games!!!!!!  On MMO's they actually have a thread on their forums for this actual keyboard! ( on how to disable it so as to not crash the game anymore )  So in my opinion, DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD!!  IT IS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!  IF YOU PLAN ON IT, ASK YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY HAVE ONE!  (something I should have done before purchasing)  SO NOW IM STUCK WITH JUNK BECAUSE IT COST ME 50+ USD AND I FEEL THAT SINCE I PAID THAT MUCH I HAVE TO USE IT"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Awesome hub at an Awesome price:),"I bought this hub and was a little worried after reading the insert.  It says may not work for high power hardware (printer, scanner, camera, etc.) and I thought ""What the h@## are people going to use it for then? How many mice and keyboards can one have? 4?"".  So I connected my scanner, printer, external hard drive, and tv tuner to it.  No problem! Everything is running without any issues.  It can't be beat for $12.  If your on a budget and need a product that does it's job, get one of these.  Or get 2 and hook them together (making it a 7 port hub)for less $$ than most 4 port hubs"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Surge Plug,"This is the 3rd surge plug that I have purchased.  The first one met an untimely death do to a major water spill from a fish aquarium, but all the equipment attached to it survived.  All in all, these plugs are the best.  Each plug is labled and you get tags to label your cords (a nice feature if all your plugs are same color and style).  the added area for power packs is a nice touch as those take up so much room"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Kingston 512 MB Secure Digital Card (SD/512),Product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it. I am using it in an HP M425 5 megapixel digital camera. It will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound
electronics,12 of 12,1.0,Does not work well - terrible support from Netgear,"This is one of those things that I bought, really hoping and wanting to be able to say good things about.  I really wanted this to be a good product; but it's just not."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great card at a good price,"Even though this is a more 'cost efficient' card compared to the Audigy series, the 'Live!' is still a great card, outputting great sound.  It's a solid addition to my system (where other sound solutions have caused system crashing)."
electronics,2 of 6,5.0,Monster Cable THX-Cetified Fiber Optic Digital Interconnect Cable (4 Feet),Monster Cables are the top of the line.  We had our new home entertainment center installed by a certified sound technician.  He was thrilled to find that we had purchased all Monster Cables for our system.  You just do not get them any better than this.  They deliver all the features they promise.  Well worth their price
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great scanner and reasonable price,I have this scanner in my office for a month.  It works great and scans both side in second. But sometimes two pages may pass thr the same time so I have to scan it again.  
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,I am unable to verify its ultra high performance,"~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Apple iPod Shuffle Battery Pack,"Nice back up to the rechargable battery.  Of course, the built in battery does not have unlimited recharges. This is the answer - extended playback time plus no worries when the rechargable battery fails to hold a charge"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Pretty good for the price,I'm writing a review on the Koss R-80. First off I had a pair of Koss UR20. These Koss R-80 off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design. The headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head. It has a coiled cord which can be removed. The cord is connected like a phone card. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,I've had my Trackman Marble for 10 years and it finally died today.,"So, I'm on amazon checking to see if they still make these things. I received this Trackman Marble in early 1996. The first computer I used it with was my trusty Packard Bell 486 running Windows 95 with 32 megs of RAM."
electronics,,4.0,Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks Deluxe,"This was my first webcam purchase so I did a bit of research before I actually purchased it.  So far, I really love it and the camera is very cute (a lot smaller than what I had imagined).  Installing was very easy and very quick.  I was concerned about the clip when I read the other reviews, but it fits my Dell XPS M170 laptop very well.  I purchased this camera to use with Skype and the quality of the picture is great.  Although it seems the picture is better on the receiving end.  When I see the image on my screen, it seems grainy to me.  I had planned on just using my Logitech mic that I use for gaming but when I called relatives, they said that the mic sounded good and didn't echo.  The USB cord is the perfect length since I already have a jumble of wires behind my laptop so that was a plus.  Only thing I really would like is auto focus but once you focus it the first time, you don't really need to adjust it anymore.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best Of The Best!!,"  It's just plain hard to beat Verbatim media.  Dvd recorder's just love the discs, they are almost flawless in coping your important data or videos on and the printable surface is probably one of the finest you can buy.  I started using these in my transfering of my son's high school VHS sports tapes onto DVD, started out using cheap media and found out later that they didn't play so well.  Now that I'm using these I've yet had any errors period!!  They may cost a little more generally but look for them on sale and stock up and you won't ever regret it"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent universal remote,"This is an excellent device if you are looking to replace a universal remote that broke, or simply want to upgrade you rold remotes to one device that will do 99% of what you cna do now from one device.  "
electronics,5 of 8,1.0,Hard cover for Plam Tungsten E,Two hard to hold and try to do anything I am going to look for a leather one soon
electronics,8 of 16,1.0,Don't buy. Very bad customer service.,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said:""You got it cheaper than other brands, what else do you expect?"" ""Viking cheats. So what?"
electronics,,4.0,"Great product, spring for a new battery and stop complaining!","I have this system in my house, and it is a tremendous convenience for me. With a 1940's era home, there are very few telephone jacks in the house, and having these plug in base stations where I need a phone are great. I don't have to spring for new wiring, have ugly cords draped everywhere, or wait for the phone company to come out to put in new jacks. I can move the satellite phones around based on my needs, like a guest staying over, working on projects in the garage, etc.  Yes, the batteries they ship with suck; I reordered a replacement GE Ni-Cad battery and have lots of talk and standby time now. I like being able to listen to messages on my base from the satellite phones. Amazon even provides you with a quick link for buying an Energizer $11 replacement battery! I do have an occasional call drop, but oddly this happens when I am closer to the base phone. This phone was not designed for commercial or business use, it is a home consumer product and should be judged as such"
electronics,17 of 17,5.0,Garmin User,"I use four different Garmin GPS units, but the one that is of particular interest here is the Legend.  The legend comes with a serial interface cable.  The problem comes with the fact that I now use a laptop with no serial port for most of my GPS mapping purposes.  Garmin does not provide a specific cable for linking the Legend to USB, and Garmin's USB-serial costs around 60 bucks. This cable does the trick quite nicely, but it is NOT plug and play. The software to run this does need to be installed, but the results are most satisfactory once installed"
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Great replacement but for one thing,"I had a Panasonic Expandable Phone System before, and I wanted to replace it when the extra cordless phone finally wouldn't hold any charge.  Consumer Reports rated this one as one of its top picks so I switched to AT & T.  To say the least, I love it.  The only downside I have seen thus far (only owned it for 2 months) is that when you listen to messages and you have it automatically dial back the message leaver by picking up the phone, it doesn't automatically dial 1, so it ends up calling locally only.  Good pick for all the gratuitous bells and whistles. "
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Long wait for replacement from Terk/AudioVox,"I brought one of this at the beinging of 2005. I found it was malfunction in Aug 2005. Called Terk, which actually is part of Audiovox, they told me to send it back for replacement. I did send it back in Aug 2005.  I have been calling them for status, they told me they out of stock, so that they can not send me the replacement.  It is end of November now, they still telling me they don't have stock to replace.  They say that they don't really make them, but contact made somewhere.  Until they place order for next batch made, they will not have inventory to send me the replacement."

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Works great,"            If you are looking for a simple phone with almost all features,and a good speaker phone,this is the one for you.I use this phone mainly with speaker on...theres no problem till now..I am satisfied with the purchase"
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Excellent Player,"I received my ZVM 60GB about two weeks ago. I have not had a chance to work it out that much, but to date I am very impressed. The screen is fantastic to watch video on. Very clear and sharp. The sound is Creative fabulous as well, as one should expect. The USB Host feature works well with my camera, slow, but usable transfers for how I use it. For those of you interested in this feature, I can copy about 400 JPG images of about 4.5MB per file in about 1 hour - this is not fast by any stretch but a useful storage option at the end of a day of shooting. Photos really look sharp on the player and you can select any image you have on the player as the wallpaper. You can also sync your outlook data (contacts & calendar). Navigation is a breeze. The unit is certainly larger than other players, but by no means a brick IMHO. I don't find it overly large, it fits comfortably in a shirt pocket and in my hand (I have normal size hands). I like the feel of a larger sturdier player. You have to realize that there are many things built into this player! Creative makes good sturdy players in my experience. Not much comes in this package. No wall charger and no usable case (it comes with a silly pouch). I will use my player more when a case becomes available, I find it rather slippery and it slipped out of my hands twice the first day I had it!!!. There are no cases currently that are designed specifically for the slightly thicker 60GB version that I am aware of. I have inquired about the silicone cases and reputable sellers tell me they do not work well on the 60GB ZVM. My gripe: The black version, which I have is a smudge/scratch magnet. While the black version looks cool, I wonder if the white is less prone to showing wear. Amazing to make something with such a finish"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Very nice MP3 Player,"This is my very first MP3 player I purchased few years ago. In two words, I just love this little thing. I visited my country taking it with me, droped it several times and nothing happened to this little machine. I had only one trouble in Athens (Greece), when I could not turn it on, but after Creative sent me an e-mail telling me what to do, voila, my Muvo is back working again. It needed a firmware ..."
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,Has anyone had experience with this service plan?,Does Amazon BACK this plan in anyway?
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Better than Shure E2c,I own these and the Shure E2 and these are way better. The bass is 10 times louder and deeper than the Shures. These have way more range  and are more comfortable. At first I didn't like these but I realized you really have to shove them in your ear. It feels a little penetrating but after a while it feels good:)
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,"not too bad, could be better...",i recently sold my logitech 4.1 z560.  it had bass that would nearly piss everyone off in my house.

electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Genuine Canon ink cartridges,Genuine Canon.  Great price.  Fast service.  What's not to like
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced,Constantly had to reboot due to lost signal. Other technical problems which are constantly mentioned in other reviews. Indian tech support while done well by other companies is extremely painful to use. If you need help ninety days after you purchase the product it would be less expensive to buy another router.Three days and two tech support emails (which were replied to at 3:00 am 17 hours after they were sent)later problem unresolved due to generic information sent from company. Case number given was useless. Netgear does not stand by their product and their customer service is the absolute worst and I can not stress this enough THE ABSOLUTE WORST I have experienced. I am not without computer and technical skills and god help anyone who encounters this company who is void of computer and technical skills. If you see this product turn around and run do not walk away.
electronics,4 of 6,5.0,Excellent Quality - Good Price,"These aren't the cheapest tapes out there, but not the most expensive either. I've recorded priceless moments on these tapes - everything from weddings to kids baseball games. I highly recommend these tapes for two reasons: high quality and accountability"
electronics,,1.0,Lousy,I got these as a sad gift - 
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great card and even better support,"Got this card a year ago and it worked great connecting my XP Pro machine to my DV camcorder. More recently, got a Firewire drive and had some problems. Turned out I needed a patch from Microsoft, but Adaptec support is without a doubt the best free support I've used. Real dialogs with knowledgeable techs - no form letters. Works great now with both the hard drive and camera together"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The Standard for 2.1 Speakers,"For the money these speakers must easily be the best 2.1 system on the market.  I went from the Klipsch 2.1 ProMedia to this system and the difference is night and day better.  There are a number of faults with the Klipsch system that together prompted me to make this change.  I'll tell you about them by describing how Logitech does it better.  First of all, the volume is on a long dongle, complete with subwoofer control.  The volume is easy to adjust and the large knob offers no static with adjustment.  The speakers are already hardwired, so there is no additional connection to break down over time.  They use sturdy RCA type connectors to plug into the subwoofer.  "
electronics,,5.0,So far so good,"I just got these.  The sound is quite good.  I interchanged them with my iPod buds several times and decided that these have a slightly better bass return while not handling quite as much volume.  These are also 6"" longer and have a rubbery texture that sticks better in the years than the slick iPod buds.  For the price, a heckuva good deal"
electronics,,2.0,"Works, but could be better","This is a well designed product but the transmitter is pretty weak.  It would be nice if it would go down to the lowest station available, 87.5, where there usually isn't a station.  It goes down to 88.1.  Atlanta is not a good place to have this if you don't like static.  It does the job and it's really great to be able to play music from my ipod to the car radio easily, but it could have been made to sound better. "
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Memorex USB 2.0 Travel Drive (2GB),"Its functioning good and good looking, but i think $70 after mail in rebate is not a good cost, other brands are offering 2GB USB flash/travel drive for a lesser cost. but technically its good and i  rate it 8/1"
electronics,,5.0,Great inexpensive remote control,"I have not used very many universal remotes before but this device meets my needs easily and I have a audio video amp, VCR, DVD, Computer and and Plasma TV which I need to control. It is easy to program and seems to be a very solid product. I have had no problems with it and can recommend it to anyone."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Just what I needed,"I love these earphones! It is a little difficult to find the first fit... I kept switching tips for the first couple of days, but now that I have the correct fit, these things are great. The sound is wonderful and they allow me to keep the volume down on my ipod (with the ipod earphones, my volume was at the halfway mark most of the time, but with these earphones, the volume is hardly showing on the meter). The earphones do provide some sound isolation; if you are looking for something that completely blocks out noise, these probably aren't for you. However, I wanted something that could drown out most noise; now I can walk down the street and hear my music even if a bus or truck is rumbling by, and I can actually hear my music while on a bus. They also do a nice job of blocking out other people in the cubes--I can tell that people are talking but it's completely in the background now"
electronics,4 of 8,2.0,sounds are not soothing,The ocean sound would have been great for soothing white noise if it weren't for the squawking seagulls on top of the waves -- makes it kind of hard to sleep to..
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Good for the price.,These aren't Bose headphones and they don't cost $300. I used them on several flights - both international and domestic and they proved to be of quality. 
electronics,20 of 22,5.0,Excellent DVD WRiter....,This is my first DVD-WRiter and i love it. I don't have any trouble with the software and the driver. I use it with my laptop (512mB - 60gb HD). I only recommend a lot of free space in your hard disk. I like the software too.
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Uniden  9485,"We've had this phone for about a month & when we first got it, the handset would ring at the same time as the base.  But lately I've noticed that the handset doesnt ring/make a sound until about 1 second after the base.  Another reviewer said the same thing for the 9485/2 and it's annoying.  When this happens the handset is no more than 30ft from the base, so I know it's not a distance thing.  Another thing is that the date/time/name ""stays on"" on the handset - which is a waste.  The melodies/tones are ""cheesy"" like a lot of other reviewers have stated."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Canon BU-10 Bluetooth Adapter for i80 Printer,Order was received fast and worked as expected. Zero problems
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,"I loved it so much the first time, I had to get another...","If you have an iPod Mini you'd be silly not to try this transmitter.  I was given an iTrip FM Transmitter as a gift when mini's were still out on the market and loved, loved, loved it! "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,"Cheap, solid, works well","Like many others here, I use this gamepad for emulators. I am pleasantly surprised by the compatibility - it works with every emulator I've tried it with (MAME, SNES9x, Nester, Gens, VColeco, Stella). There are no drivers to install if you own Windows XP - detection is flawless. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,i haven't heard anyhting bad about it,"my friend sold me his one that he never used. it sat around for about a year before i registered it. so far i heven't heard anyhting negative yet about it, except for the price i guess"
electronics,22 of 24,2.0,Weak FM Output and Poor Audio,"I have owned this iPod FM transmitter for about 11 months and have used it while driving thousands of miles through many FM radio markets.  In urban areas this unit is not useable, because, despite the availability of the three FM presets, you can't find open FM frequencies in urban areas, and if you do, the unit's FM modulator is not strong enough to overcome  adjacent channel interference from city FM radio powerhouses, and typical poor car stereo FM tuner performance (selectivity).  "
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Overall an excellent product!,"I thought for quite awhile before making this purchase, and after reading the reviews I expected it to be somewhat problematic.  However, with reservations, I went ahead and made the purchase, thinking that I might have to send it back.  Fortunately, I am happy to say that I am pleasantly surprised with its performance and ease of use.  It is MUCH better than I expected."
electronics,,5.0,Well worth the price!,"The 2-year service plan was easy to obtain and delivered in a timely manner.  Any product should have a service plan and at this price, you can't pass it up"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Great Gaming Keyboard,"I bought this keyboard about a month ago and I love it.  I wanted a backlit keyboard, and was looking at the other Saitek (eclipse I believe), but people said the paint wore off the keys so that they didn't even have letters on them anymore.  I found out about this keyboard, and decided to give it a try."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Easy to install and use!,"I bought this card because it came with a cable.  Giving the card only a 5 rating. Not super impressed by the editing software, MyDVD.  It only burns VCD's with basic functions. In order to burn DVD's you have to purchase the upgrade. I will probably end up purchasing more sophisticated software for editing. I installed it on my Dell Dimension 8200 running Win XP. Plug and play just like the instuctions say.  Easy to install, Win XP recognized the new hardware, couldn't be easier! Economical card, gets the job done"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Fast Track on Delphi Roady2,"I was very pleased with the ordering process, response and delivery on this item. I may never go back to retail stores"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Portable Speakers that pack easy,I have owned many portable speakers...none have the sound quality that these have given their size.  They actually fit perfectly in the top pocket of most rollaboard luggage...solid flat case.  The reason they sound so good is that they use a planar speaker design much like Magneplanar high end audiophile speakers or Monsoon computer speakers.  Low mass means fast accurate sound reproduction with little energy.  One price though is the unrealistic bass many like to hear is not there but the bass that is natural is and it's reproduction is very accurate...better than speakers 10 times the size because of planar design.
electronics,,5.0,Perfect for our small office,"We run a small business which involves a lot of everyday printing. Having used inkjet printers for years, the improvement in speed is amazing.  We are saving money by not buying so much ink.  The toner seems to last a long time. Would buy it again"
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Cheaper at  [Amazon.com],"My Stylus Photo 1280 prints beautifully, the Epson inks are obviously perfect for it...The interesting point is, the [Amazon.com] price is cheaper than Office Depot. Order the ink from [Amazon.com] when you are ordering something else and there are no shipping charges, so it is a great savings"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,ok recorder but doesn't finalize discs anymore,"NO LONGER FINALIZES DISCS.  TIME TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE.  after reading several reviews of dvd recorders, i chose this one and am not disappointed.  it records dvd-ram just as it is broadcast live, more or less, there is no difference.  the dvd-rw are a little distorted on 6hr record time, but that's to be expected.  it does the same job that my eight year old panasonic vhs recorder does.  thanks for producing a good product"
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,Panasonic KX-TG5576M Talking Phone,"I really like the phone, however, the talking feature that lets me know who's calling is not very clear and is low so I can't really hear who's calling from another room which is the main reason I bought this phone.  Also, the ringer volume is not as high as I would like it to be.  I do, however, like the answering machine feature and the fact that you can put pictures in so that whoever is calling, their picture shows up"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Simple, cheap and effective","The iSqueez Cradle allows an iPod to be placed in any cupholder. The iPod is secure even on bumpy roads and the iSqueez can be instantly removed when not in use. No adhesives or complicated attachments are required. The video iPod fits, although the angle at which it rests may not be the best for viewing"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,perfect,used it with my Nikon D80 and works perfectly. I copied the photos from the camera and as it supports USB 2.0 it copies very fast. 
electronics,,4.0,A Solid xD Card,"The Olympus H-type 1 GB xD card works well and has provided reliable service.  As with all xD cards its write and read rates are not up to other formats, thus it only gets 4 of 5 stars.  I guess no xD card would get 5 from me"

electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Replace your 1Gb/2Gb with this baby,"Awesome product from Seagate. Seagate have always topped the hard drive concepts and with this product they just rocketed themselves up. With Altoids round box making it a perfect carrying case, u need not worry to have the disk always placed in your dirty pants with keys/coins. Just fill a thin layer of cotton in yout altoids and give this baby some comfort in the box and it works wonders. Easy to carry and load everywhere. I use it atleast 300 times a day. If the blue lights bothering you just flip it. If you are the one going to school/college, this is the product which you gotta buy and stop worrying for memory for another 3-4 years"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Good for the price,I bought this to replace my on-board sound and noticed a nice improvement.  This is a very good replacement for an on-board card or upgrade.  I wouldn't recommend it for those wanting superior sound or a desire to create a system around it
electronics,0 of 2,2.0,Worst Discs Ever,"I've burned almost 100 Memorex 8X discs in four different PC DVD Burners.  Roughly 1/4 errored during the burn.  Of those that burned, over 1/2 pixelate and lock up when played on PC or home DVD player.  My firmware is up to date and I haven't had this much trouble with any other DVD-R except for Staples brand.  I give them 2-stars since they do work well in my home theater DVD Burners but only in Standard Play mode and at 1X burn speed.  In EP or faster burn modes, they pixelate."
electronics,4 of 9,1.0,Stinks!,"This thing barely worked a mile from our home.  And don't buy it unless you have the FCC license.  These didn't work on the channels that don't require the license, and barely worked using the channels that do require the license.  You might as well just use a cell phone.   They shouldn't say it works up to 18 miles if it barely works for one mile.  They are not at all worth the money. "
electronics,7 of 8,5.0,As good as it gets!,I had one of these cards; I was really happy with it until I misplaced it and got stolen.
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,does not work with new Inte Dual Core iMac,No response from Griffin Tech support.   Very sad.... great product if it worked with my Mac.... but it does not....
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,OK,"Looks good, sounds ok. The dynamic bass boost introduces hiss but makes the sound more bassy. 4 stars for looks and price. -1 for sound quality."
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,perfect receiver,"this receiver is great, the reveiws made me a little skeptic on the quality of the product. One think i do note however is that you need to turn it up pretty far to get good volume out of it, but besides that it great, nice remote, and I had no problem reading labels on the unit of anythin"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Excellent Sound Quality and Perfect Size,"I've just received my new iPod Shuffle, and let me tell you, it's a real beauty."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Hard to go wrong.,"My home theater receiver is across the room from my computer, but I wanted to use my computer's digital out capabilites to connect them.  This USB cable works great with my audio advantage micro digital audio USB device"
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Broken Subwoofer,I've only had these speakers for 6 months and the subwoofer has already stopped working. These speakers are cheap but they are also flimsy and have poor workmanship. Spend the few extra bucks and get something better
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Portable and fits in your pocket,"I've had this drive for almost a year now, and it is just wonderful.  The main reason I bought it was to transfer files from my desktop at home to use on a computer at school or on my laptop.  This drive benchmarked at about 24MB/s read, which was just 2MB/sec slower than the drive in my laptop.  "
electronics,2 of 5,5.0,My favorite program,"I won't reiterate other raves about the product, but I do want to say that Propellerheads has [have?] shown great integrity in producing a really clean, reliable program"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,SO MUCH FUN,I Got this toy for easter it was so cute and cuddly its so much fun that all my friends and family love this cute toy one time my sis came pulled its tail and there went that annoying hiss but i love it so much and i play with it everyday parents IT'S WORTH THE BU
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great photo paper ,I have tried several different brands and types of photo papers for printing out my own color photos. This brand is definitely the best!  
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Digital Camera Paper,"This is a very fine product which I use exclusively. Your pricing is the best I can find, which includes Best Buy and so called discount stores."
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Works great with Cannon Powershot A70,"I had a 512 simpletech card, and loved it.  I got this 1gb card a week ago and it has worked great.  The 512 card was used very heavily for nearly 2 years, and so I purchased from simpletech again.  The card maxs out the meter which suggests how many pictures I have remaining to take, unless it is on the highest setting.  It says I can fit roughly 950 pictures from this 3.0mp camera on the highest settings, but I have not been able to take that many yet!  Batteries only last for 300 pictures, so I probably don't need a card this big.  It is nice for videos though, and it can hold about 15-20 minutes of video at 640x480 15fps.  It also seems to write very quickly.  Much quicker than my lexar card.  For most users, I would suggest having 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb.  Don't keep all your eggs in 1 basket"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Never a format it doesn't like.,"The machine is too expensive. That said, It plays both European PAL format and the American formats automatically. It will actually view JPGs.The battery life is good. The machine itself is set up with a fairly easy instrument panel. The screen is the right size."
electronics,,1.0,Junk - Ignore User Reviews,I thought I would be getting a well made coffee maker...what a hunk of junk...cheap and flimsy...gold cone coffee filter doesn't fit basket even though it is size four...how totally annoying...
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Great investment,"I purchased this Ipod round speaker and I like it. However, I did return the item when I first received it because it was not working correctly. There was too much static. I return it for an exchange and as soon as I received the new one I tried it at it worked. I work in an office at this is perfect for my limited space. I recommend this item to anyone who want a speaker that will not bother other coworkers. good working item"
electronics,,1.0,This phone sucks...buy a cheap Radio Shack,People can't hear me.  Speakerphone doesn't work well either.  Why pay over $200?  Headset mode... doesn't work either
electronics,11 of 11,1.0,Incompatible with single receiver systems,"Nowhere in the description or packaging does it say that this antenna requires a satellite multiswitch. A multiswitch is used for systems using more than 1 TV/receiver. The antenna amplification comes from the satellite multiswitch, and without amplification, this antenna is no better than a pair of simple rabbit ears. "
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent case for both 30 GB and 60 GB,"I really like this case.  It has exceptional fit and finish.  All the openings are cut perfectly, precisely outlining the screen, wheel, and connectors.  I have one on my 60 GB, my wife on a 30.  Neither of us has seen the scratching problem reported by other reviewers, but we usually leave the case on.  The only down side is the fixed belt clip on the back.  It takes up extra space when I'm not using the clip"
electronics,,4.0,Very Good Value for Money,This charger is really good value for money.  This charger shows each battery's status individually and charges them quickly.  i did not monitor the time to count the minutes and seconds but it was reasonably fast.  Also refresh feature is best.  i like the looks and functions of this charger
electronics,,5.0,Cheap Notebook Stand,This is working out real well as a notebook stand for me.  You can't beat the pric
electronics,10 of 16,5.0,Great flash drive. Huge hidden gems inside a rather bland looking device.,"This is one of the most boring looking flash drives on the market, but one has to look past it's looks and see it's amazing software package offerings."
electronics,8 of 9,4.0,"Pricey, but works better than knock-offs","Don't be fooled. I purchased a knock-off Nokia CA-42 cable and it worked sometimes, didn't connect well, and the driver caused my computer to freeze."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Saved me time and money,"My home set up has my computer in the basement, the router on the second floor.  This has worked fine for a year or so, as long as I was the only one using the wireless.  As soon as my son got on the network from his computer (also over the wireless) my connection would get spotty and I'd have to reconnect frequently."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,The price is right !,This stand works great for bringing the monitor up to eye level. If you want to sit comfortably...get rid of back and neck strain...this Targus Stand is definately the way to go. And...the price is right
electronics,2 of 7,2.0,Not so sure of the up conversion technology...,"To make it short and sweet. I have the JVC 61"" HD-61FN97 True 1080p HD-ILA Projection TV and the JVC RX-D412B Audio/Video Control Receiver. My main DVD Player prior to his purchase was the Xbox 360. Well after using every connection possible and testing each source a million times to include back to back comparisons with duplicate dvd's. I would say that the Samsung 960 did not display anything amazing that the Xbox 360 couldnt display. I'm returning my Samsung DVD player tomorrow. I thought the up conversion was going to help out but instead made noticeable distortions at 720p and 1080i settings. I could not get the TV to validate the 1080p via HDMI connection. I would say this was a week long evolution. From online support to on the phone support, countless hours were spent trying to get the set up to display max resolution with minimum distotion. ""Maybe my HDTV is to BIG"". But the Samsung 960 does come with the HDMI cable which will save you about $50 bucks"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Nice mount?,The combination of vent and windsheild mount is very useful. I use the vent mount in my car. Very stable and convenient.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,AWESOME PRODUCT,"I've been using Memorex DVD-R for almost a year now and I should say this product is awesome!  I never had a bad DVD, unlike other blank DVD which I usually get error during write or sometimes won't play on my Toshiba player.  I have an HP DVD writer. It cost a little more compared to other brands but since I'm not wasting any of it due to bad write, it actually ended being cheaper.  And with this price from Amazon...it makes it even better."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Book stand,"I was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand, and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic, but when I received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work.  Holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely.  It does come with book page holders, but I don't really use them"
electronics,,5.0,Hot Surfer,..almost doubled my download speed from cable broadband - worthy upgrade from old modem. No problems and seems reliable so far. A little pricey for a modem but hopefully the quality will be there after the price is forgotten.
electronics,,5.0,Just the right size,My hands are small and large mouses hurt after a days use. This mouse is just the right size and works well
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,SanDisk really stands behind its products.,"I bought this SD card 2 1/2 years ago for use in my Magellan Meridian GPS receiver. Worked great until last month. Went to SanDisk's website for help. The tech support people had me go through some diagnostic procedures and determined that the card wasn't fixable. They arranged for me to return the card to them and even paid for shipping by FedEx. Two days after they received my old card, a new one was on its way to me. Just received it today and it works like a charm. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent and portable memory card reader,I love the design and the size of this memory card reader.  Very portable and works great.  Reads pretty much all memory cards that are out there on the market at the moment.  Would recommend it and would buy it again
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Excellent with the caveats noted........,".......in earlier reviews.  It cannot pick up accurately if you are too close to buildings, under trees, etc, but i really dont know too many inexpensive GPS units that work under those conditions.  For the price an excellent choice"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,Lots of discs are a very good thing...,As a person who has used lots of writable CD and DVD products I would highly recommend this product. I have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product. If your storage needs are under 650 + megabytes I would buy this product. Note : This product needs several Megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 Merabytes of your data. For the price listed this ad it is a great deal as well..
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Great value, awesome picture quality","I bought this cable to use in conjunction with a new LG brand L1932TQ 19"" flat panel monitor.  I could not be happier with my purchase.  The picture quality is vastly improved over the analog cable I had before.  The cord is also very solidly constructed and is long enough to have quite a bit of extra length if I ever need to move my monitor for anything.  I would buy this product again in a heartbeat, especially at the low price I paid on Amazon"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,ugh!,"got this installed today along w/ the pioneer deh-p58000mp head unit at best buy...plugged in the ipod, check mark shows up on the screen, and....nothing...i can't even control it on the head unit...sometimes, if i'm very lucky, the check mark screen doesn't come on for 30 seconds or so and the ipod actually plays (it's at the normal ipod screen), then once the check mark screen comes on, complete silence...i have a 3g 10gb ipod and as far as i should know, it should work...the head unit is also annoying b/c if you put the mp3 cd on random and want to skip songs, it unrandomizes & plays the song right after it...so if you're like me and you skip songs a lot and like to set it on random, it doesn't work...i think i'm returning both tomorrow.."
electronics,64 of 65,5.0,Nice Little Stereo,"If you're looking for bells and whistles look elsewhere. If you're looking for 3 or 5 disc changer, not this one. If you need a nice little stereo to play one CD at a time, space saving, full and clean tone - this is awesome !!! It looks really sharp, has a crisp sound. Perfect for a small bedroom or office. I am very happy with this purchase. Has a tape deck as well and radio. EQ settings are simple - no presets, just bass and treble - there is also DSGX switch [kind of like a loudness setting] just leave it ON. Very simple, well made - I like it !! No frills, great price"
electronics,,5.0,Excellent product,"I am a novice concerning computers. However, The Kingston 512 MB memory was very easy to install. And it is performing extremely well."
electronics,9 of 21,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I bought the Shure e5c after reading some reviews, and based on using their phono cartridges for years.  There is no bass with these phone, even when I get a good ear seal.  I wrote to Shure explaing the situation and their Customer Service did not have the courtesy to respond to the message.  I then called the 800 number and just got the run around until one of the representatives stated that a new model was comming out shortly and would fix this problem.  That does not help me now and by sure I am not going to waste another $450.00 on a lousy product from Shure"
electronics,6 of 12,4.0,apple does it again,"I have just gotten my blue ipod nano. It is so cool! My dad and I downloaded itunes in advance, and we just put some songs on it. I don't know if we did it wrong, but it took a long time to just put three songs on my ipod. The ipod has a really nice color, but it looks extremely delicate. I am afraid to just leave it in my pocket. You should definetly get one, but be sure to buy a case for it!"
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Great Product,"The GPS device works just fine and gets you to where you need to go.  The only gripes that I have about it is that I noticed that sometimes it does not give you the best route possible.  I would program it to locations aroud my neighborhood and it would create a route that is not always the best one.  However, it always does get me to where I need to be.  Also, I havent bee able to figure out how to move the map around on the screen.  I wanted this feature so i can have a general overview of an area before I get there.  If anyone knows how to do this please let me know"
electronics,,5.0,Rocks!!!,I bought this Controller at Walmat for around 32.00 worth the money no lag whatsoever buy this Controller
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great Little Mouse!,"I bought it for my laptop but use it for my desktop! No frills but does what I need it to do. Love the on/off switch. Took a bit of use getting used to the small formfactor (ached until I repositioned my hand), but now my hand aches less than when I had a larger mouse (I'm on the PC a lot). I also find it easier when editing photos than a large mouse for some reason - Feel like I have more control. I got it on sale under $25 on Amazon"
electronics,13 of 14,4.0,does the job ,"got this mount as part of promotion with 46 inch LCD. LCD weights over 80 pounds which is not that bad. Hanging the wall plate was relatively easy , but second person would be helpful if you are not handy. If you are putting this mount on the wall by yourself , I wouldn't be relying on the level attached to a mount, but rather level and drill the holes for the screws. Of course, be sure to find the studs first and make sure you can align the holes on the mount with the marks on the wall."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,So far so good,I have only had this hard drive for 2 months and Amazons' survey came so I responded; usually I would wait longer.  But so far so good.  Everything works good including the backup software.  Good equipment for the money
electronics,15 of 22,1.0,lasted about a month,"I had mine for less than a month when the antenna wire pulled away from the magnetic part of the antenna. -I have to qualify this by saying that I did not install the antenna per the instructions. Because I live in a bad neighborhood, I can't leave something like this on the car- it would get ripped off. So every night when I got home I would carefully remove the antenna and put in inside my trunk. After a few weeks of this, the wire broke off from the magnetic part of the antenna. The exact same thing happened to my wife's unit. Maybe this would not have happened if we had installed the antenna ""permanently"", but let this be a warning to anyone who thinks they will be able to take this type of antenna off/on."
electronics,,5.0,$15 TV? Awesome for the money,"Hey, you get what you pay for. Keeping that in mind, this is incredible value for $15! We bought this for our earthquake preparedness kit and it will do the job no problemo. "
electronics,,5.0,TIVO USB network adaptor,"Works perfectly with only a few steps of set-up.  The set-up instructions are very easy to follow.  It does not, however, work well with the Apple airport.  It works great with the Linksys airport.  I'm not technical enough to know if that can be overcome, but since I have both, was not an issue"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Little Radio,"I bought this radio based on another buyers review on this page and I was happy that I did. Now I can listen to Michael Savage at work! Yey! This little thing can pick up stations from as far away as Atlanta, although, fuzzy. I can also get in Jacksonville (70 miles) and Savannah (80 miles) so yeah, I'm happy. It's steal at $12.00. And I love the old school design. It's funny how people my age (28) don't even know what a radio looks like! They ask, ""What's that thing?"" like it's some unusual device from Mars. Maybe they're stoned. Anyway, it's a sound investment if you want a nice little portable radio. Also I think it arrived in only 3 or 5 days which was another plus."
electronics,5 of 8,5.0,Best backpack for a laptop EVER!!,"I've never seen anything that kept my laptop so safe from damage and/or water.  If you want something hip AND protects your notebook computer, buy this Targus backpack"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,How do you open it?,"So far, I'm not too happy with it!I just got my hard case and as sad as this is, I can't figure out how to open it! Help!"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,You may be surprised to learn what uses electricity: I was.,"I plugged my Kill-a-Watt into my stereo and TV system.  With the TV on and all the components (receiver, cable box, TiVo and a couple other gadgets) I was amazed to see that it drew almost 300W!  I started turning things off and while the TV was a lot the one that amazed me was the cable box, which runs 24 hours a day and drew over 100W!"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Good Bass and comfortable,"I'm not a audio-hound. I bought these headphones to watch movies as I don't listen to much music. These phones have a great sound. Like others who have noted the enhanced bass, I love the bass. I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced). For example, they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you're not always dragging around cord that's continuously getting hung up on something. The only down side I have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with, how shall we say, over-sized heads. They are comfortable. The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these. Other than that small inconvenience, I would highly recommend these phones, particularly to people who don't place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound. As a matter of fact, I am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radio"
electronics,6 of 8,4.0,Which Warranty???,I was going back and forth on which warranty to get. There is one for $199 and one for $279. I saw the posts that said they were the same thing! That is partially true! I called N.E.W to find out what the difference was and they said that the warranties were the same but it depended on the price of the TV on which warranty to choose! I told them that NO WHERE on the amazon site that it defined that difference. She said that if you chose the wrong warranty and tried to file a claim that you would have to pay for the difference for the right warranty. BAsically the warranty for $279 is for TV $1500-2500 and the one for $199 is for lesser value TV IE less than $1000.
electronics,,4.0,Be Careful about Compatibility,"This is a fine addition to the Panasonic KX-TG5672B base unit, but be VERY CAREFUL, this handset is NOT compatible with the Panasonic KX-TG5673B base unit."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,The T10 works well--with a little help.,"If people love cats or hate them, the T10 headset phone is no different. So many reviews were critical, I hesitated to even try one. But I'm glad I ordered a T10, and it's a keeper. Instead of giving the phone a good workout for several months, I'll review it now so as to report my initial experiences and address the complaints."
electronics,40 of 40,1.0,Everything sticks to it,"I bought this case because it was cheap but I haven't used it because dirt and cat hair just CLING to this case.  The case doesn't even have a clip so it's pretty much useless.  Yes it will protect your player, sort of but it bulks it up when you have to carry it in your pocket.  I bought the DLO Action Jacket for the Sansa SanDisk e200 series which protects the screen and has a clip and armband. The DLO case is the way to go!!!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great little speakers,"I needed a couple of remotely located speakers to put in my garage and workshop and didn't really want to run wiring for them.  Also, I wanted to be able to control the volume at the speakers rather than having to go all the way to my receiver."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,THEY HAVE OTHER USES,"Forget the computer, I plug my Ipod Nano into these and they work fantastic."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Don't buy,"No bass and very poor all around sound quality, I returned the item"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Great overall, but could use some work","This device is great. It's relatively cheap (far cheaper than anything similar I've seen out there) and it does exactly what they say it does. It's very useful to know how much power the major devices in your home are using. For example, I had no idea that my computer was drawing 200W at IDLE, so now I know that I should upgrade my power supply to a more efficient one."
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,Do not buy this.,"This came dead out of the box. Firmware upgrades and reformats do not fix it, all you have to do is google Muvo TX and see how many other people are having problems with this piece of garbage. Creative will also refuse to refund your money and instead try to get you with a 40 dollar credit. This product is defective end of story, search for yourself"
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,Driver Conflict with Dell Laptop,I have owned this trackball for almost a year now and love it so much that I have carried it with me on all my trips instead of bringing along a mini-mouse like many do. 
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,"Awesome, and a great deal, too","These headphones are great.  Set-up was simple, and the sound is amazing.  One issue - the connector in the remote transmitter (the one you hook-up to any audio device) seems to mix the audio channels together unless I remove the audio plug slightly.  Other than that, I'm very impressed with the dynamic range and the value you get for your money"
electronics,,4.0,Works well ... so far,"I just received my Belkin Tunebase and immediately set it up in my car (a Honda CR-V). It took just a few minutes to set the unit up from plugging it in to tuning it to 4 ""empty"" spots on the radio. I should mention, first of all, that I live in the Los Angeles metro area. Several others who posted comments about the tunebase said that they could not get decent reception in LA. I have no reason to doubt them, but, in my case, this doesn't appear to be true. I found two spots on the radio where the reception (on the Tunebase) is good, although not perfect. On my first drive, I didn't notice any static, but I did get some static on a second drive in a different direction. The static--really more of a hiss--isn't that noticeable for louder music, but if you like listening to classical or very quiet tunes, you may not be happy. "
electronics,,5.0,Incredible Sound for an Incredible Price,"I'm not one to explain or understand most audio specs, compare systems or buy the most expensive audio components there are. This 3 piece self-powered speaker system was recommended by a coworker and the user reviews certainly helped in the decision making process. Still, I was doubtful, of course, as I love my gizmos and the price was under $120.00.  What kind of quality could this be for that price?"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Dominant,These speakers have great sound and power. The sub has awesome sound and power. I have powerful subs in my car and this one does a great job. It gets as deep and knocks as hard as you would want it to for any kind of music. I highly recommend these speakers for someone who's looking for quality multimedia sound at a low price
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Good product with an added bonus . . .,"One unexpected benefit of these headphones is that with the noise-cancelling on, my hearing aid does not feed back.  With most headphones, I have to turn down the hearing aid I wear in one ear to avoid feedback from the headphone cup.  And so the music in that ear is much quieter.  With this set (and perhaps other noise cancelling phones), I can leave the volume up on the earpiece, and I get a much more balanced audio experience than otherwise"
electronics,,4.0,"Comfortable, good sound, flimsy cable","These headphones are pretty comfortable (although it's cramped enough that I still felt the driver pads rub slightly against my ears) and sound good.  However, the cord is very flimsy, so don't use it where it's likely to get snagged."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Better than the original,"This is the best, most elegant, reliable keyboard ever."
electronics,15 of 17,5.0,Turning Phone into Media Player!,"This expansion is great, now I have over 120 songs loaded in my phone. Great Media player"
electronics,,4.0,I was happy with it,"For the price of about $50 new, I was happy with it.  It was my first mp3 player and it fulfilled my basic needs as I worked out on an exercise bike"
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,"Perfect for the new MacBook 13""!!!!","As the market still needs to catch up with producing laptop cases that fit the new MacBook, I looked at covers currently being offered for Notebooks."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,This mouse works great,"I teach as a computer teacher.  I bought one of these for me, then got one for my graphic computer.  That was 6 months ago now I'm going to place one on all 25 computers and replace those dreaded ball mice.  Previous reviewer obviously had user error involved or merely one bad mouse which can happen.  Mine have worked FLAWLESSLY and for the price this is the best optical going"
electronics,42 of 43,5.0,Great little TV for the price,"We bought this for my Mom early in 2003 during her stay in a convalescent hospital.  When she eventually went home, she ""donated"" the television to our guest room.   We installed it in an armoire where it was used extensively by guests until June of this year.  Now it sits happily in our home office/exercise room where it keeps me company during my daily workout.   The picture is great and the VCR hasn't missed a beat.  (I'm just hoping that the TV/DVD combo I just purchased as a replacement in the guest room works as well!"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Simple and Efficient.,So far I am happy with this product. Installation is simple and the design of the outlets are well planned. I am thinking of going for one more item for my computer system
electronics,,5.0,SWEET,"I got my irock used from my nephew who needed money. I didnt like the ear buds so I got some noise cancelling headphones. I take mine to a construction site every day and patch it into a big JVC boombox. and have dropped it so many times on hard concrete and it has always played. I even took it to the philippines for 4 months vacation with me, the 20 hr airplane flight was much easier with this beautiful little unit. The sound is great and I can delete and add songs so easily with real player. Just recently I wanted a larger capacity unit and got online but was very disapointed that irock dont have any 1 or 2 gig players. So I settled on a Sony wich is really nice also. But for durability, great sound, ease of loading music, long battery life, i wanted another one. But why isn't irock cranking out some higher capacity units, cuz they rock.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Another Great Sony Product,"I've been a Sony customer since 1962 when I purchased their 101 reel-to-reel Tapecorder and it still works as well as it did the first day. Needless to say, this Sony SRF-M97 Radio Walkman is a gem, but programming the initial stations is cumbersome. However, after much trial & error it all comes together. It's worth every cent!"
electronics,14 of 17,4.0,"Lack of Video Support compared to Zen!! Only con i see, but its a big deal","Im would love to buy this 80GB iPod, i really would. The only thing keeping me from buying such a beautifully looking designed piece of technology is the lack of video format support. Ive looked at the Zen and it supports a ton of video formats, but the one thing that keeps me from buying it is it looks really ugly and plasticky. I hate having to convert my recorded TiVO shows just to upload to my iPod, its way too time consuming. Maybe ""it's not what's on the outside, but whats on the inside that counts"" might apply here too. Im going to decide tomorrow and i might up flipping a coin. "
electronics,6 of 11,1.0,Deceptive specifications from manufacturer,"You may want to stay away from this product. Memorex claims write speeds of 15MB/s, but when I transferred/copied 600 MB of data to the flash drive, it took 35 MINUTES, instead of about 40 seconds. Also, many files were, to my amazement, ""lost"" in the transfer/copying process (i.e. simply did not copy). So the drive is not only much slower than claimed, but also unreliable."
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,GPS 300 - GOOD VALUE,"It took me 4 phone calls and 3.5 week waiting time until Magellan finally sent me a window mount that was compatible to the backplate of my GPS system.  However, after this initial glitch, I made positive experiences with the GPS 300.  It takes only about a minute until the GPS 300 finds my locations.  Graphical and voice instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Maps are not very accurate, sometimes misleading.  Also destinations are not always chosen through the most direct routes."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Performs as advertised - Does it well,"  Performs as advertised - Does it well.  Clear sound.  Does not eat batteries.  I use NiMH rechargeables, I don't hear any difference from alkalines"
electronics,,1.0,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I got this DVD player because it was cheap and I figured it would get the Job done. Well big surpise every dvd I put in it skipped all over and soon it made a loud grinding noise.
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,"Simple, fine printer."," It is exactly what I expected in that, I wanted a printer with the simplest function and inexpensive."
electronics,,5.0,Great Deal,"These headphones are the best I have ever purchased. They are light weight, comfortable, and sound awsome. I also like the way they fold up."
electronics,12 of 12,5.0,Excellent Product,I recommend this product to any ipod lover who needs to charge their ipod but dont want the hassle of hooking it up to your computer.  This power charger works great even for my 60 gig. 5th gen. Ipod video.  The only concern is that the there is no indicator that the ipod is completely charged.  But it does have a safety feature so it won't overcharge the ipod
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,AWESOME CASE!!!!  WELL WORST EVERY PENNY,Just got mine and it was easy to slide in and out.  No scratching and looks great.  nice belt clip feature.  acccidently dropped my ipod about 3 feet and no damage.  highly recommend this over the silicone case or any other case
electronics,,5.0,What a picture!!,I just received this from Amazon. I want to also commend the people at Amazon for their service. I bought this and used their free shipping option without realizing how much longer it would take with that method. I still received my TV a week after purchasing. Now that's fast!! I am also impressed with this TV. The picture is incredible!! I must admit that it helps to use the S-Video port if you have that capability. I just need to get a VGA cable for my lap top and I will really be set. So far just my cable and DVD player have the S-Video ports. Thanks Amazon for your quick service and great selection!
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Very small .. slow only when writing a group of small files,"I like the size. The speed on reading and writing is usually just fine, but when writing a group of small files it takes ages"
electronics,2 of 30,4.0,"games do not impliment the ""clutch"" pedal feature great for Hard truck series though(unlike all others)","Supposedly someone listened at the Logi office of the NASCAR MOMO discontinuation for a cheeze model of nearly equal price.  That does not excuse this exorbiance.  The clutch pedal is not implimented in games and until it is you are paying for a dead hand(or foot).  This wheel and the transmission (hump) style gearshift is quite cool and gee whiz is the first re-action, the console buttons are only useful, again if the game doesn't back out of it.  Hard Truck series backs out of any digit button or other past # 10 with in a few minutes play time as it is not designed that way and can cause software corruptions. One would usually need this for race car games, but it can be used in other driver games making it more diverse and no need to buy a separate unit for compatiblity probs.  However. in as and most games do not even use more than six or eight buttons or macros at a time, the extra buttons are redundant gimiks.  The styl'n Corvette style trans-hump shifter with the console buttons is nice to look at (stick a virtual transmission hump of carpeted cardboard on the ground under it for realistic effect) and the gear can shift better than a rudder(better used as a turn signal) other than that, either go down on price or give us key-to-button config in games that do not support it.  Heel-toe shift is simply a way of saying shift with the clutch, how lameo is that"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Back up your data for cheap,"100 cds is a lot of cds (though you'd be surprised how many it takes to back up a PC. Uh, when DID you last back up YOUR data?) "
electronics,,5.0,"Finally, a home for your iPod","This little machine has it all. My daughter got one for her birthday and we LOVE it. It plays her itunes and wakes her up in the morning. It has a remote so she can select volume, songs and more from the comfort of her bed if she wants to and the clock has an option to turn down the light so it wont keep her up at night. Finally, no more annoying buzzer to wake up to and also no more trudging up the stairs for me to wake her up. Plus it charges her iPod instead of having to plug it into the computer to do the job so she never runs out of battery on the thing any more. We love it. The only drawback is that it smells awful for about 3 weeks after you get it but that eventually goes away"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Static Free Performance,This product is terrific.  I live in a large metropolitan area but was still able to find a spot on the radio that did not cause interference with iPod's performance. The sound coming through the speakers exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it.  Just be patient finding the right spots on the FM frequency. Definitely the All-in-One solution
electronics,,4.0,"great cans, but not with an LG phone.","The sound quality from the MM50 headphones is wonderful, especially considering the source is just an mp3 player embedded in a cell phone.  Unfortunatly I have to pull out the headphone jack one 'click' in order to hear full stereo sound.  This is annoying, but it also means that the mic and push to talk functions are rendered useless, which is almost a deal breaker.  According the the side of the box these work best with Motorola phones.  My LG is out of luck for compatabily.  That said, the sound quality alone is good enough to justify the price and the hassle of use, so I will keep them.  Highly recommended for you Motorola users out there"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent Product!,"I bought this product so that I could talk with friends and family through Yahoo! Messenger. Seeing as the price is so low, I wasn't expecting much. I was surprised to see how light the headphones were as well as how comfortable they felt over my ears. Also the two plugs were perfect for my laptop (I have a Dell)! The quality of sound isn't ""stereo"" like, but it does the job well!! Great for the price considering it's Sony. I highly recommend it!"
electronics,5 of 7,4.0,Great Way To Keep Your NANO Protected AND Close To Your Hip!,"The Speck Nano Toughskin with Belt Clip and Screen Protector is a must have for anyone owning a Nano. If you've splurged for one of Apples greatest products, the Apple Nano, then I'd make sure to buy some sort of holder that offers good protection for the body and for the screen."
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,"Good MP3 player, but needs some tweaking to be great","I recently purchased the E260 on Amazon, and I am relatively happy with the purchase.  The E260 is a nice music and FM radio player, has good sound, and has a decent user interface.  I find it easier to use than the Creative Micro that I used to have.  I do not have problems with the buttons (and I have large fingers), and I find the movable wheel very useful.  The touch sensitive bar on the Creative was too sensitive and difficult to operate."
electronics,,4.0,Good for the motorcycle,"I bought the E2cs and they were not too good.  These are very good and fit very nicely under my motorcycle helmet.  Makes those 1,000 mile days much more enjoyable.  Also very nice for airplane trips"
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Greate device to use with Skype,"I'm so happy I purchased this device. I have all the freedom to move around my house while talking with friends using Skype, bundled with Plantronics CS50-USB. I had to download the latest version of PersonoCall from Plantronics website to make the headset work properly with Skype, but once I did that, the sound is clear and loud and the range is over 200 feet.  I love it"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Definitely the best Media Player,OK ... let me start by saying that I don't go gaga over every other decent thing.
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Great/Only Choice,I don't know of any other choice of ink for the Epson R800 family of printers.  {this is one of eight cartridges used for this family of printers.  These comments apply to all colors.)
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,I've tried it all...,"...and this is the best media I have come across at the 16x speed.  I have tried it on three brands of burners with only 1 failure out of 50 tries (and that one was likely as much my system's fault than the disk's fault).  The three DVD Burners brands that I have used are Lite-on, Rosewill, and MicroAdvantage.  They ARE buggy on certain Pioneer Burners, so you may want to avoid them if you are using a Pioneer."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,outstanding,"I recently bought a Motorola Q, it has some internal memory, but not nearly enough. I picked up a 2GB Mini-SD card, and BOY is it nice.  Too bad they don't have a 4GB version yet.  I encoded my 40 Year Old Virgin DVD to DiVX, with great quality, and it only took about 450 megs on the card (about 1/4th of the space) and threw on tons of mp3's, my nintendo emulator with games, and installed a bunch of smartphone apps. Still having space left. You could EASILY fill this bad boy up without trying too hard, but it gives a whole lot more space then the 50 or so megs the phone has free when you get it (motorola Q) would also be excellent in any device that takes Mini-SD cards"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Use it day in and day out,"I run a small business.  Since we generate 4 different types of labels, I also have a Labelwriter 310 and a 400 turbo hooked up via a USB hub, in addition to the twin turbo. But if I were starting over, I'd have two twin turbos. These things are exceptional, and exceptionally easy to use and to switch between the left side and right side. And I'm using them all day long. Also, the price here is the best I've seen for the twin turbo. (My computer is a Mac running OS 10.4.8."
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,High Speed / My Speed,"This product exceeded my expectations.  I initially purchased this Sony Memory Stick to increase the recording time side for my Sony TSC-30/B digital camera up to the supposed 35 mins (according to the specs) standard.  To my surprise it increased to almost 3 times that, at 1 hour 32 mins!  The clarity is phenomenal.  The standard Memory Stick runs the video at 30 frames per second (fps), this High Speed Memory stick takes it to 80 fps.  I am loving every minute of it!  Going thru Amazon was a big plus also. I got it at $149.00 which is just $30.00 over the standard retail 2GB price (around $120.00).  At retail I would have paid twice the cost.  Thanks Amazon."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Best printer ever!!!,"I just received the 8250 today, and I'm happy as heck with this printer. The reviews are soooo diversed that I decided to take a chance and see for myself how this machine actually prints. For 119.00 delivered, I figured I would'nt be out a whole bunch if it didn't perform that well."
electronics,0 of 2,4.0,Good stuff,"I don't know a lot about web cams, but this camera has been reliable and also came with a free headset, which is pretty good for me"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Works fine with GPSMAP 76CS on my mountain bike,I've been using this mount in conjunction with my GPSMAP 76CS on my mountain bike with no problems.  Installation to the handlebar is simple with just one screw to hold the mount in place.  
electronics,,4.0,Nice earbuds.,"Quality of sound is excellent. Some complain about lack of bass; that is so untrue if you compare to any other earbud type. It may be true if compared to some types of over-the-ear headphones. I use these for traveling mostly when flying. I use them with my phone which plays MP3s and I also have a Creative (iPod type) device that I use them with too. When I use them with my LG VX8300 cell phone, I can hear noise in the background like digital switching but this is the phone's issue, not the earbuds. In other words, with these earbuds, you will hear any flaws in the source if there are flaws. What is really amazing is some of the things I hear when listening to music that I've listened to many times before. In one song on Elton John's Live in Australia CD I can hear some guy in the audience at one point between songs and make out what he said which I've never heard before even though I've listened to this many-many times before with other headphones. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Rio 500 and Windows XP,"To the person who can't transfer music to their Rio 500 under Windows XP, check out Sveta Portable Audio from http://www.dbpoweramp.com/. I've been using it since I got a new PC with XP installed and it works great, much simpler interface compared to the supplied Rio software"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Awesome Accessory,This is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers.  You don't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming!  Excellent travel accessory
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,"Yes they are heavy, but.....","     As many people say they are heavy.  21 ounces on the head as opposed to my old Sony 405's at 12 ounces.  However after a couple of days use (and by letting the weight of the phones rest on my recliner) I now find I have adjusted.  The sound is first rate, and only limited by the quality of the input. In reading other reviews I notice many complaints about the power requirements, but I seem to get better output at lower power levels than other phones with these. (at least on stereo recievers).  I do have a big head, and yes they were tight, but the bands are made out of a good quality metal and will allow for slight and permanent tweaking for fit.  Lastly, yes they are hot.  All good closed cups are, but my solution while it may not be fashionable, is excellent and actually hygenic.  I cut off the tops from an old pair of socks and slip them over the cups.  Works fine, collects the sweat and dirt that would otherwise gross out the phones, and even allows multiple users to feel a little less intimate than they might want to be.  For the price and quality there is no substitute.    Thanx JP"
electronics,,4.0,Excellent Headphones,These are a great set of home headphones!  They sound wonderful.  The only gripe with these headphones is that they are not that portable
electronics,13 of 15,5.0,The BEST DVD player under $200 with upscale/HDMI/SACD,"I just picked one of these up yesterday.  So far, I'm ABSOLUTELY satisfied with what comes in the package.  Right out of the box, I noticed how well this thing is built.  More metal than plastic like the other DVD players."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Product,Works great with TRU9466 base phone. Very easy install and quality is great
electronics,1 of 3,2.0,Hiss is more than slight,"Granted the product is very cheap, but I decided to try it out.  It is pretty noisy, about like a old cassette tape with no dolby.  If you listen to rock and pop, you probably won't notice it that much.    The 3 eq bands do what they should and help warm up the the smaller ear buds and phones"
electronics,0 of 1,2.0,not for MAC!!!,"Even though the site says that it's for Pc and Mac, it's only PC compatible. Very frustrating. Doesn't work for Macintos"
electronics,,5.0,Great battery,"I bought this to replace original Canon batteries that came with my Canon A280. This is really good and I am happy with battery life, charge time etc."
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,The way to go...,"This is the best way to purchase the paper for your PictureMate Printer....  The cost comes out to approx $0.21 per print..  When you start using the second cartridge, reorder another pack.."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,No problems - none - zero - ,"My DVD burner is a BenQ and I use Nero 6. Every dual-layer DVD has burned perfectly. I think the review by ""A. Clark - 'Great Dual Layer DVDs'"" says what needs to be said"
electronics,2 of 20,1.0,Disapointed,He didn't send me the product that he was selling. The keypad is not USB and also it wasn't new and also it wasn't targus.
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Returned it.,"Cable picture is poor. Sound is terrible. Despite matching its progressive scan capabilities with a progressive scan DVD player, it DID NOT meet George Lucas' picture specifications (which can be accomplished by tube-televisions over 10 years old). Too bad Sony has discontinued making anything under 20"". "
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Great gadget !!,"I've been after one of these for months as you all know in todays world we have so many usernames and passwords to remember.  Most people have system or use the same passwords but then you get to a site that wont except you normal combination !  Well this little device has worked every time for me.  Easy installation, one reboot and you are ready to go.  Use it to logon to windows (not domain though) and then open up internet explorer and start registering sites.  The other major disappointment with this reader is that it doesnt work out of the box with firefox, which is bad as this is what I use most of the time but..... the good news is that there is an extension (plugin) for firefox that lets you use it, its by no means full proof but its a step in the right direction."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,work horse,We used this device on a roadtrip from Los Angeles to Portland and back. Primary use for this device was to power the laptop and the gps receiver. Yes and the cellphone. This inverter worked 24/7 without a problem - it got hot but never made any noise at all. The only negative point is the converter switched off when we stopped the car engine. But this is to protect the battery not to get sucked empty. Car builders: make a 110 volts outlet a standard in cars
electronics,20 of 20,5.0,Radio *My* Way,"This is a talk radio listener's dream. I shopped around for an mp3 player/recorder, specifically to record satellite radio. I record almost daily. RadioYourWay is everything I want. A VCR for radio. "
electronics,,5.0,Great cable for the money,"Unlike some of my other 25 foot cables, this one produced a perfect signal.  You don't need more than this, it's a good buy, especially at this price."
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Sennheiser HD-280 Dynamic Collapsible Headphones,The headphones cancel out most of the area noise and sound great.  They are a pain if you are only using one side.  I like the fact they go flat for packing.  They work for me
electronics,,4.0,Only one problem,"Overall, this is a very good phone with many solid features.  My only complaint is that there is no way to adjust the volume for the message alert.  Because of the poor location of the phone jack in my kitchen, I have to put this phone in the master bedroom upstairs.  Unlike my last AT&T phone, which allowed me to adjust the volume of the message alert, this one has a very quiet beep, and the volume can't be adjusted."
electronics,,5.0,Fast and High Quality,"This printer has now been in service for a couple of months at my house.  It is extremely fast and performs with great print quality.  The grey scale reproduction is good, but not great.  Considering the price of this ""GEM"" from HP, the quality is outstanding"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Great printer, even if it is out of date","I needed a new photo printer to replace my aging HP 5550.  Looking around at newer printers, they seemed pretty speedy and had a lot of grand claims, such as pictures lasting longer than the normal lifespan of most humans and amazing print speeds.  However, if you look closely, you'll see that the ink tanks for most of these new printers are amazingly tiny.  You'll probably spend quite a bit more money on ink cartridges than the old printer you're replacing."
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Terribly disappointing,I have put my comment in title itself - Terribly disappointing.
electronics,15 of 19,1.0,This didn't work for me.,"The idea sounds great, but it just doesn't work too well. Whenever you pick up your hand off the mouse it's hard to get started again"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,A Great Buy,"Being an avid music fan I've shopped around for alot of headphones on the bottom end of the price scale over the past year. I've tried out the Sennheiser 212,202,201's, Grado SR60, and these Koss Porta Pro. These Porta Pro are STUNNING. The main complaint with Sennheiser is their bass always seemed to be turned up a little too much and these Porta Pro have a very warm bass. Although these headphones are the ugliest of the bunch, they're actually very comfortable and easily transported. The sound quality though is comparable to the Grado's, this may seem like an overstatement but I think they truly hold their own. The fact that they are 20$ is the most amazing part. If you own an ipod or cd player and want a pair of headphones that have a lifetime warranty and truly impressive sound I would get these."
electronics,,4.0,Great sound,Sounds great and not too big.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the headphones aren't as conmfortable after wearing them for a long time. 
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Great ipod protection,I got these as extra covers for my ipod. I love the colors and
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,Do not buy this Thing called a Radio,"I have rarely been so dissapointed as I was when I received this thing (I hesitate to call it a radio.) I live in Australia and do a bit of international travel.  I wanted a travelling radio (AM in particular)that also plays my CD/MP3's. Read the info, and it states in the manual and ON THE UNIT that it is both European and USA frequency compatible in the AM band.  NOT TRUE!  The US version is US and the European version is  European only.  So yes it is a travelling radio, it just doesnn't like to travel far!"
electronics,9 of 11,5.0,The ultimate -- don't listen to the whiners,"I bought this clock for my daughter after reading the reviews with her of all the cd-rom alarm clocks on Amazon.  All the features sounded incredable.  Guess what -- they are!  This clock is the ultimate, and she will probably keep it for most of her life.  The nature sounds are great, the alarms are great, the sound quality is great, the MP3 input line and separate jack for headphones work great.  We have had the clock for over 2 months now, and it was well worth the money.  As for the negative reviews, take them with a grain of salt.  There are whiners in every crowd"
electronics,,1.0,Unreliable,"I have a PNY disk.  Shortly after the purchase I started getting ""Memory Card Error"".  It lasted intermittently for another month then died.  This is a sure sign of poor quality control.  I bought PNY because it was slightly cheaper than the other disks.  I suggest investing your money elsewhere.  It is worth the extra $$$ to save your precious information"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent,These sound great.  Far and away better then the Creative SBS260 Speakers.  I bought both to see if there was any difference.  I have given away the SBS260's and am ordering 2 JBL's for my wife and daughter's computers. Highly recommend for the price
electronics,5 of 10,5.0,Great Product - Great Value,"This is an excellent GPS for a demanding user at a budget price. My remanufactured Roadmate 700 arrived in perfect ""like new"" condition, and has worked flawlessly out of the box. I have often used the Hertz ""NeverLost"" system in my business travels, and am excited that I can own one just like it at a reasonable price. "
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,iSkin Eclipse iPod Protector,"The iSkin Eclipse iPod Protector turned out to be exactly as it was advertised to be . . . extremely functional in protecting my 30GB iPod . . . as well as good looking, especially desireable since I am totally ""covering up"" the beautiful aesthetics that Apple has designed into each iPod unit, in the name of protection.  Yes, a little tricky to get the clear acrylic face plate protector installed securely within the neoprene case . . . but no big deal."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Computer Geek,"Absolutely one of the best printers around, especially for the price!  EVERYTHING works unlike some of the comments in the other reviews.  I've had no problems in any respect.  And it's fast.  I wish that I had purchased the 1320 sooner because it's a winner!  Recommend it without reservation"
electronics,6 of 12,5.0,Bravo!,"This is an extraordinary, cute and very well priced pocket PC which I am sure you will also love once you take it in your hands. It offers various operations and is small enough to put it in your pocket. I am very, very satisfied with it and I want to congratulate HP for yet another great product"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,died after 14 months,"We were satisfied with this phone for 14 months. Then one day we came home and there was a static sound coming out of the speaker. It got gradually louder and then went silent. The loud beep when pressing keys is gone as well as the speakerphone and the caller ID. Unfortunately, it was covered by a 1 year warranty. Now we have to find a replacement"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Amazing Headphones With An Unbeatable Price!,"This is the best pair of headphones you can get for under 100 dollars. These look nice, are very comfortable and light-weight, have AMAZING sound, and replaceable cables in case they snap, or simply stop working. You can also remove the earcups for more portability. Some say that there is too much bass on these earphones. There is more bass than other headphones, some may like it, some may not (I personally love it). The cord is generous, just about 9 feet long, but it gets in the way sometimes. It's hard to put my MP3 player in my pocket and have to stuff an additional 5 feet of cord in my pocket just so the cord doesn't drag on the ground. I understand that it was intented for home entertainment (ie. connecting to your stereo and going across the room), but it's a bit inconvenient if you're going to use it for your MP3 player. That is the ONLY problem with these earphones, and definitely don't let that steer you away from these headphones, because this set of headphones will make your ears and your wallet happy."
electronics,5 of 33,5.0,A must!,"Don't skip this cable! You are wasting money on HDMI equipment if you don't hook it up correctly.  I used component connections while I waited for this cable to arrive, and I was blown away by the difference it made when it came.  Now I have a set of brand new Monster component cables gathering dust in my closet. "
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,"Overall, a great pair of earbuds","I bought a CD player and decided to go ahead and get a pair of earbuds  with it. I picked these and I must say, when I got them I was really  impressed. They came in this neat handy case that you could swivel and it  would roll up the cord for you, they looked cool and sounded just awesome.  But I don't know if it is just me, but it is really hard to get the things  to fit snugly in my ear. They keep wanting to slide away. It did come with  some foam covers, and they helped a little. Still, other than that, these  are around the best earbuds I've ever tried"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good little player,"I bought this player a few months ago.  I researched and compared here on Amazon, and settled on this one.  This is the first mp3 player I've owned, and I have not been disappointed at all."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Awesome for the price,I picked these headphones up for about $70 with shipping. They seem to be made very well and are of typical Sennheiser quality. Definitely a good buy
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"update from Oct 17, 2002","Still rated 4 stars. In response to the June 23,2006 review, my ruler says 42 inches - 3 feet 6 inches. Maybe in four years since I wrote my review, Plantronics put a longer cord, maybe a customer suggestion or something made em do it.The measurements for the Mute and On/Off buttons are correct BUT they still are right next to each other, still have the same tactile feel as one another and so I'll still contend that it would be easy to disconnect instead of mute."
electronics,6 of 6,2.0,Gadget not for the Traveler on the Go,"I bought this unit for use with my 3G 15GB iPod. While it did work to transfer my SmartMedia cards, there are some major caveats for potential buyers. #1 - the battery life of the Belkin unit is low, download three session of a day or two of pictures (200 - 1MB files) and the batteries are dead, #2 - the transfer times are painfully slow ... that 200 files transfer took 20 minutes and that's without a clear indication about the progress or status, except the flickering light, and worst of all #3 - the connecting cable was subject to being jostled and losing connection, which resulted in corrupted files on the iPod (not fatal). The only way, I could get the unit to work prperly was to place it on a rock-stready hostel table and leave it alone. When I used it on a BritRail train table, the transfer was disrupted by slight jostles. And once when I had to try and pack up the unit in the middle of a transfer (emergency Underground stop) trying to maintain the connection while holding it was impossible"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,It's pretty good.,"I wanted a DVD/VCR because I still have the occassional tape and until I get those in DVD format, I need something to play them with, so I asked for this for my birthday. There's nothing special to be said about it, but works for what I need it for and how often I use it."
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,The Best Paper I've seen For My Epson Printer!,"  I've used my Epson 890 Printer now for many, many years. I was using Epson High Gloss Paper for my printing needs with great satisfaction. I tried this paper and boy did the picture pop when printed. Such a beautiful blend of colors, and a professional look, you will be truly amazed. I have always used Epson inks and the printer has worked perfectly. I will go into custom settings when printing and set the DPI to 2880. Between the high DPI setting and the Epson Premium Luster Paper I can't go wrong (and neither will you!). For that little ""extra something"" when it comes to printing your special photos believe me you'll be very happy with this paper."
electronics,17 of 18,5.0,"Simple, easy to use and hook up, and delivers the goods","Sony hit a home run with this, the best SACD player on the market for the average guy making the switch to super audio. When I changed from stereo to SACD I first bought one of those player that does both SACD and DVD. Nyet!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,very good product,"it's very useful for my wife because she always lost road,it has very clear voice(english) and display a very beautiful map,also it is very smart and wise"
electronics,12 of 12,5.0,Review of Panasonic KX-TS105W corded speakerphone,We were looking for an uncomplicated speakerphone without features we would never use.  This is hard to find in retail stores.  We found just the phone we needed and we are very pleased with it. 
electronics,31 of 48,1.0,Great phone,"I recently purchased two of these phones for my office to replace two very disapointing GE models, as soon as I had them set up, I immediately bought a third for my home. It might seem to be a minor detail, but even the batteries were included. The hands free feature is excellent, programming is a snap and fairly customisable, the intercom is great, it's expandable up to eight extensions, great sound quality all around. I hope that panasonic will make a cordless model that is compatible with this system"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,The Version 2 Card is Good,"The provided software is largely immaterial to the Linux user, only implementing the drivers (in conjunction with ndiswrapper & wpa_supplicant) found in the /Driver/NT/ subdirectory of the supplied CD."
electronics,,5.0,"Great Product, Great Price","Just what I wanted, Works perfect, Best price on the internet."
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,"Portable, but powerful!","This is a nice piece of speaker. It fits nicely on LCD screen of a laptop. You won't believe the sounds that it produced. Amazing! I would say you can hear the sound as far as 100ft away. It really work well if you need to do a presentation in a big classroom that requires louder sound. It also comes with a pouch that you can store the device if not in use. Connection is simple. Just plug it to any usb port or use its external battery pack. AC adapter is an optional accessory which is somewhat disappointed consider the price it is selling for. Overall, I think this is a good investment  if you need to produce louder sound when using a laptop"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Does the job,"It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue)."
electronics,7 of 13,1.0,Not even for $20,"Thinking about the Samsung HD-841 - forget it! That player is horrible. Frequently froze up, refused to play many brands of DVD-Rs and would not play DVD+R DL discs. Buy the Toshiba SD-6980 instead. The Toshiba player handles all of the DVD-R and DVD+R I've thrown at it and plays DVD+R DLs as well. Also does a great job with DVD-Audio and SACD."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,fm works well,"I have in plugged into the jockey box, it overrides weak stations well.  It's a little expensive but seems to do the job and it means no cables hanging around the cabin.  I'd buy it again"
electronics,,5.0,SIMPLY THE BEST!!!,Pros:
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,Great VoIP Phone,Perfect phone system for VoIP.  Seamless operation with voicemail and other VoIP functions.  Packet 8 now offers 7-digit dialing as well. 
electronics,,4.0,Short term reliability,"For the time being as I am in the process of purchasing a new computer, the USB device will work for my laptop, taking into consideration the fact that I don't have powered up devices attached to it that would draw from the laptop. "
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,5 POUNDS SHIPPING?!,"eforcity sent me the wrong and defective items before - there is no way this item could weigh 4 lbs and have a shipping weight of 5lbs... that is how they make money on 89 cent ""products"". I had to use the Amazon guarantee to be reimbursed from the last time eforcity sent me garbage. THANK YOU AMAZON, YOU ROCK"
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Almost Perfected!!,"Sometimes manufacturer's get it right.  This product is no exception.  All of the features work as advertised.  It is economical with it's use of the ""printing film"" (for copies and faxes).  Of course, the more you fax and copy, the sooner it will run out."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Solution,"Great solution for the price. With the CPU under the desk, no more reaching under it to plug in my jump drive. Super"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Awesome,"Fast delivery; quick, painless, effective setup."
electronics,8 of 9,5.0,Great Phone,"My previous phone was an AT&T also. However, I wanted an extra hand set for one of my other rooms. Pleased with my pevious phone I elected to choose AT&T again. I am completely satisfied with my choice and would recommened it to anyone. All the features are outstanding and the ease of use is great. I am glad I selected another AT&T product again. E"
electronics,,5.0,Dual XDM6820: A Dang Good Deal,"I too was looking for an iPod connection for my '99 9-3 Saab that was w/o original radio/cd. I couldn't believe the price on this unit but the reviews convinced me, anyway it was fairly easy to install, took me an hour from start to finish. All I needed were 12 solderless connectors and a wire stripper/crimping tool. I've been using the unit for a week now and will agree with some reviews who say the lights are too bright. Great for daytime, way too much for night. I've considered a couple options, one was dark window tint overlays but I've decided to alter the removable faceplate provided with the unit to fashion a cover. I'll slice the FP cover in half at the hinge giving me two covers, some velcro and I'll have a cover that will work at night, set the unit how i like and place the FP cover over it using the velcro to secure. Should be a breeze to do."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Good Sound but Bad construction,"This production is horrible.  I bought this as a gift.  Even though it had an average sound quality (Through Skype), the headset broke several months later with normal use.  I would not recomend this product to anyone"
electronics,14 of 14,1.0,"Great sound, horrible DVD","The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer.  The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem.  Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit.  I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Compatibility issue,"Five stars for quality because of its reputation, but a quick note here to say that these are not compatible with the Pioneer PDR-609 CD Recorder - a somewhat picky model.  I used TDK instead with that older machine.  Before buying a 100 pack of anything, buy a single disc or small pack with the rest of your Amazon order to check compatibility first"
electronics,,5.0,Mouse review.,I don't use this mouse for gaming like it was advertised.  I use it for drafting and 3D modeling programs.  I have no complaints about the use and performance of this product.  This is the first cordless or laser mouse that I have used and don't have much to compare it to.  The two interchangeable batteries is very useful:  when one goes dead just pop it out and put in a fresh one.  I'd definately recommend this mouse to anyone
electronics,6 of 9,5.0,Canon BCI-6 Black and Color Ink Tanks,"The BCI-6 8 cartridges pack was a great purchase, and the price was great"
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Piece of Junk!,Have this USB card for some time now.  This has crashed 3 of my machines and took me a few weeks to determine it was this card causing the issue.  It does not play well with XP Service Pack 2.  I don't have time to mess with uninstalling Service Pack 2 and Windows update.  
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Description very appropriate,This item is just as the description says.  I am extremely pleased with this system.  Highly recommend to others.  I bought it for work so I could listen to my Nano.  The sound is unbelievable for this price!!!!  Amazing bass
electronics,,5.0,Awesome Awesome :),"Wow this thing is everything I hoped for. I was so sick of plunking away on the crappy, stodgy keys of Apple's ponderous Pro Keyboard, and longed to find an external keyboard that would mirror the comfortable typing action of my Macbook Pro. This keyboard totally fits the bill. It is super slim and typing on it is a dream. Because the keys are half-height like a notebook keyboard, typing is fast, easy and effortless. There is also a very pleasant tacticle feedback, and a soft pleasing *click* with each key, which personally I love. Yes the keys are a little smaller and some in different places than a standard external keyboard, but it's easy to adjust and I find the added comfort of working on this more than worth the effort. Included are some standard hot keys which is nice - volume up/down/mute, cd eject, etc. These require software installation to work, but that was a snap with the included cd. "
electronics,11 of 15,1.0,Not Palm Compatable,"This SD card is not Palm OS compatable, so if you do not have a windows PDA, don't get it. I made the mistake of buying this for my new Tungsten E2, and it doesnt work. Be forewarned"
electronics,8 of 9,1.0,Polycom dropped the ball,I had been following this device for several months before it's release; Polycom has always developed superior conferencing products in the past so I expected this device to outperform other USB Speakerphones.  I was wrong.  We received the Communicator and started testing it with multiple applications such as Skype and MSN Messenger.  The Speaker sounded excellent but the microphone on the device was near useless.  The person on the other side of the conversation could barely hear anything.  I adjusted every control I could find and it made no difference.  I will be returning this device as it is an overpriced paperweight.  
electronics,24 of 24,1.0,A Lousy Product and No Customer Service,"I purchased this product on the recommendation of Amazon.com and have regretted it ever since. It's the worst consumer electronic item I have ever purchased. No wonder the price has dropped 50% since my purchase. They probably can't give them away. After about 90 days, the product goes completely dead. After contacting customer service, I was told to reset the product. Two weeks later it went dead again. The last time I went to the manufacturer's website, I couldn't even find any contact information for customer service. They must have so many complaints that they can't handle them. Not to mention product returns. Save yourself some money and a lot of grief. Buy a Garmin system. The graphics aren't as good. But at least it's reliable"
electronics,0 of 26,4.0,Sound System for College,My Logitech Z-4 arrived a while back in the mail and I never got around to writing up a review. The reason why I only gave the system 4 stars is because I have never actually played any music through the system... BUT the system still deserves at least 4 stars without hearing the sound quality... and here is why. 
electronics,19 of 22,4.0,"Very good tablet, mouse performance is unacceptable","I've been using the 9x12 for a few months now and I have been very happy with the product's improvements over the Intuous 2 line. I love the fact that it is only about an inch thick and fits easily into my lap--the Intuos 2 was monstrous by comparison. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the mouse, which should be among the most accurate mice available, suffers  from awful jitter. I am not even touching the mouse and it is jittering up and down about a pixel or two. "
electronics,,5.0,Good buy,This is an excellent purchase. Dosent give me any problems whatsoever and it comes with a Memory stick pro slot into which you can insert this and use as a memory stick pro device.
electronics,,5.0,Great headphones,Clear sound as loud as I can take it and they come with a sack to fold up into. Would make the same purchase again!
electronics,6 of 6,2.0,Does not work with large SD cards,"Buyer beware.  This reader does not work with large SD cards.  I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card.  My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work.  I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet"
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,"Great look, good protection",The protector looks great and protects very well my ipod. I have it like 1 month and the screen protector is in perfect condition
electronics,26 of 26,1.0,Be an educated consumer!  You don't have to spend a lot for *digital* cables,"You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals.  Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel?  There's no gold inside!  So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables.   If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie.  Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference."
electronics,,5.0,remote is awesome,"awesome remote....controls all of my electronics in my living room with jus one remote,that's including TV, DVD player, Satelite, VCR,...etc. Only downside would be the size...it's larger than any other remote i've owned..but still worth it...because it packs all remotes into ONE"
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,Works great in the Canon SD600 (IXY Digital 70).,"I dropped this card into my Canon, low-level formatted it (which took about 5 seconds) and now this card allows me to take over 680 ""Large"" images at 2816 x 2112 pixels in Superfine mode (least amount of file compression). Or over 17,000 images in the ""Small"" image (640 x 480 pixels) and high compression mode."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works great; price is right,"Used this on a remote construction project instead of a noisy, heavy generator. Worked fine with Bosch variable speed jigsaw and Makita variable speed drill. (This unit replaced a cheapo 400W inverter I previously burned up using the above tools."
electronics,,4.0,Wrap that rascal!!!!,"There is no doubt that these sound great. There is also no doubt that the design sucks. After breaking two sets, I bought a third (yes, the sound is that addictive). BEFORE I used them I took black electrician's tape and wrapped the weak points (all joints, the headband - basically any screw you can find). I have used them now for about 18 months and they are still unbroken. So, if you want to enjoy the sound and avoid the inevitable breaking (and they will break), wrap that rascal"
electronics,8 of 8,1.0,"Great form factor, but dead slow.","I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB with this, but I'll keep looking. I used it to transfer a 700MB, 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC. The transfer seemed pretty slow, but deleting those files from the Sandisk took *61* minutes! Back it goes"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Roadmate Carrying Case,  
electronics,10 of 11,5.0,Streetpiolet C340,Received my Garmin within a week after I ordered. Just in time to take a nice long trip the first of Oct. Streetpiolet C340 worked flawlessly. Was going to get the C330 but after reading review here found out for just a few bucks more Jill would speek the names of the streets. Found out that was a great help.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works like it's supposed to.,I bought this UPS to help protect my Tivo and TV.  It worked fine out of the box and when I pull the power it keeps my TV and Tivo going fine
electronics,,5.0,Great Adapter,"Easiest adapter I've used.  I'm a college student from the US, studying in England. In order to get all of those little things to run which make life easier I went with this adapter. I've purchased two of them and use them both daily, and have so for about 2 months now. There hasn't been a single problem with them yet. Don't use high output items such as hair dryers too often b/c the fuse will blow. For my laptop it has been great"
electronics,5 of 5,2.0,APC BIPOD,"I've used this for about 3 months.  At first, it seemed to work fine except for secure sites which it did not recognize at all.  Then suddenly after 2 weeks of use, it failed to recognize my print.  That corresponded to a software upgrade.  I had to reinstall the device.  Again it worked fine except for secure sites but after a sofware upgrade, I was again locked out and had to install the software again.  Just today (7 May 06) another software upgrade killed its recognition capabilities.  I'm tossing it out!  Only can recommend it if you do not want software upgrades.  It is the omnipass software which is the problem"
electronics,,5.0,This is a keeper.,"Unlike a Delphi XM boombox I tried a year or so ago - and returned - this one gets it right.  The sound is great, the hookup is easy, the internal antenna works amazingly well indoors if near a window with southern exposure, and it looks good too."
electronics,77 of 102,5.0,Length,This Cable is 6 feet lon
electronics,,5.0,great product ,"this product works awsome, im very impressed with it all together, i like the fact that i can controll the movie i am watching on my tv with in plus i can still charge my ipod video through the reciever.  the remote is alot smaller than i anticipated but this isnt a bad thing, i recommend this to al"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Very pleased. ,"I purchased my 30gb iPod a little under a month ago and have used it extensively ever since. Over the short, but generous time I've interacted with my iPod, I've come to notice things I love about it, and some things that irk me, but in the long run, don't take away the value that this iPod holds."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great sound for the price,This is the best sounding speakers you can buy for your Ipod for the price
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Taking it with you!,"Quick and to the point. My wife and I love it. The speakers give great sound, holds charging life well, great carrying case and nice remote. The only possible cons are that the remote has to be pointing pretty much head on to work and if you like your music at deafening levels, we don't, look for another speaker. We use it on the boat, deck, in our hotel rooms (soon in Tortola) throughout the house ... Take it with you"
electronics,,5.0,Great for all that plane rides!,"I bought this to use with me whenever I travel on the plane. Noise isolation is great and it helped me to listen to my iPod, or watch the the inflight entertainment system without blasting my ear drums off. In fact, noise isolation is so good that I use it as ear plugs on the plane when I go to sleep."
electronics,,2.0,Old technology from Emerson Research.,"I used to have this same unit under the brand name ""Emerson Research""  It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model.  For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,Aural dessert,"These headphones are like being in a warm waterfall of sound. I listen mostly to jazz and classical and you hear the players taking breaths while blowing their horns. If there are better sounding headphones, I'm not interested because after years with my 580s they still send me and never disappoint. They create a precise, gorgeous aural world that you can just drift away in"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good batteries better than disposables,These are good rechargeables for the money they are a steal I highly reccomend them.  They are always strong at the first bunch of uses but they will get weaker I think I read they are the strongest the first 1000 uses or so just buy more after that they are cheap and good qualit
electronics,,5.0,Best Value for sound/price ratio,"I think these headphones are great. Earlier I bougt the HD-202's which also sounded great, but those were unbearably painful to wear after a short time. So I returned them and ordered these. "
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,An excellent product,"Simply put this one gets the job done.  Perfect size for a laptop, very precise, easy to setup and has a very solid ergonomic feel to it.  I previously purchased a Microsoft mouse and returned it since Microsoft mice disable screen savers and monitor savers on Windows XP equipped PCs.  This mouse has no such problems."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,No up to scratch,"Sorry to disgree with the other reviewers, but I found the performance of these headphones well below par.  I bought them for my wife before we flew to Germany, and I have tried them out on a number of flights since.  I have found myself switching the noise cancelling on and off a number of times to check if it is actually doing anything."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,My Findings on AW721 Acoustic Research Headphones,"I found the AW721 Acoustic Research Headphones slightly larger than expected, although a pretty good fit. They are comfortable,"
electronics,0 of 14,5.0,Great Product,This is one of the best investments I have made for my computing needs. I can take my most important applications and my data with me whereever I go. Especially useful for my email accounts and internet access
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Couldn't be simpler, works perfectly","This mouse worked with my Dell Inspiron bluetooth capable laptop right out of the box.  It is so nice to have a real mouse with my laptop, so I don't have to use that mouse pad.  There is no transponder to have to plug in to my laptop and to have to keep track of.  This is an excellent product"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Just as good as the Competition...For $200 Less,I was very surprised at how good these headphones sound. I'm an airline pilot that sits in the back about 40 hours a month. The NC50's stand up well to the new QC3's. (For about $200 less!)
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect they just died after about 3 years........,"These are perfect for running, biking or any kind of sport you do, well maybe not any sport. The sound quality isn't the best, but good enough for me. They're good enough to block out a bus full of noisey kids. I also like this because they don't get in the way of any sunglasses you might have placed on your head. My only problem with them headphones is that they died after about 3 years. They're my favorite kind when it comes to earbud headphones.  They're cheap and of great quality (they just die after 3 years of abuse). A definate buy"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Fantastic Headphones at a great price!,"I bought these headphones after trying a couple of cheaper philips and sony sets and also reading nothing but good reviews. These headphones are fantastic the sound quality is excellent, I use them for watching TV/Movies at night, and they do a top job. Other headphones I tried sounded quite tinny. these just bring movies and music alive. also these are the most confortable headphones I have ever worn. You dont even realise you have these large things on your head. Other headphones Ive tried tended to get quite uncomfortable after a short time. They do sound better after about a day or two, to break them in. The Movie/Music switch dosent seem to do much/anything. These headphones are well worth the price. "
electronics,,4.0,Does what it is supposed to do.,It is a compact flash reader/writer and it does exactly that. So I am happy with it
electronics,,5.0,Really Good Cordless I am recommending to Others!!,"So far this is a great phone!  Great sound and a lot of nice features.  Also, the expandability is a great feature that we aren't using yet but will be nice for us in the future"
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,it didnt work so i had to send it back,"i received this item quickly but it did not work, the one output from the component outs was not working causing a tint to the picture. also the sound outputs were not working correctly causing a hissing noise. all in all, this item said it was remanufactured but it didnt seem like it was even tested. i was very dissapointed"
electronics,,5.0,Great especially for old CD-reader ,"I used several high speed CD-R disks to burn music CD for my 1998 car. However, they just cannot be readable. But this CD-R has multiple written speeds, so it can burn a great CD suitbale for the old CD in my car as well as new CD of course."
electronics,2 of 11,5.0,Awesome,"This is a great thing to hold all of your data,like music files, pictures and a hole lot more."
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Great sound and easy to take anywhere!!!,"For such a small speaker system, the JBL II produces a pretty good sound.  I am VERY pleased with my JBL"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Amazing Monitor!,"Until recently I'd been working with the 17"" Apple Studio Display, the beautiful companion to an equally stunning Cube.  But demands of my work as a photographer necessitated upgrading to a Powermac G5.  I continued to use the CRT monitor, convinced as have been most graphics professionals, that LCD monitors just don't cut it.  The opportunity came to sell both the Cube and Apple Studio Display at a fair price, which left me with the decision of how best to replace the monitor.  Prices have been coming down for the Apple Cinema Display and from what I'd read, they're more than a pretty piece of hardware."
electronics,,5.0,Great Phone,The best phone ever. It has a speaker phone in each unit which works great
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Why pay more?,"These speakers have a good sound, not stereo quality by any means but how much can you ask for, at this price :), and the company shipped them immediately.  The white exterior looks clean and attractive.  I've had them about six months and they still work great. "
electronics,3 of 12,1.0,Crashed System,"Might be a good product, but my PC ran into problems when I tried to install software. Everthing seemed fine, then when the PC restarted, the system kept crashing. Finally, I had to remove the software and return the product. I think I'm going to buy a new computer with a DVD burner already installed. By the time I upgrade my PC to accept this external burner and factor in the $120 for the burner itself, I could spend a little more and have a new PC. Lesson: check the system requirements"
electronics,,5.0,A Great addition,I thought when I up graded to the plasma things couldn't get any better I was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top I love this thin
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Is 18-pin, not 24-pin - but...","18-pin is exactly what I was looking for!  A 6 foot cable (with the same number of pins)made by the same company (therefore presumably of the same calibre craftsmanship and parts) would have set me back $149.99 - or thereabouts.  This monstrous 13 footer cost me $65, to my house."
electronics,0 of 7,4.0,Quality HDMI Cable,"I ordered this item to use with my Infocus X2 projector and found out that I needed a different cable, one that is an exclusive cable to the Infocus X2 projector.  However, I plan on buying another TV in the near future that will be perfect for this cable's type of hook-up.  This cable appears to be well made and durable and will make quick connections to my next portable TV and HDMI DVD or satellite box connections.  I'm keeping it because I can see needing it for future hook-ups"
electronics,,5.0,mburns21,I LOVE them. Better sounds than my stereo speakers. Highly recommend these speakers. Don't have to spend $250 or more for great quality and sound.
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Not for use on Treadmill,I bought these headphones to watch TV while on the treadmill. They don't work at all for that purpose. Interference from the motor causes them to cut-out. They work great when I stop the treadmill
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Used abt 60 till now - no failures,Verbatim is great. not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs.  I use Nero to perfectly complement the burning process. I was sceptic when i did geta great deal (~25 AR). heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Does the Job,PRO:
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great cable for the money,"I've seen simmalar cables selling for much more money, the Belkin cable does a fine job at a fair price. It works with all of my firewire devices on both Mac and PC"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,excellent cordless mouse for laptops,It is my first cordless mouse because I has been reluctant to get one due to worries about unstable connections and bad battery life of cordless mice. This one exceeded all my expectations. 
electronics,,4.0,Replaced a damaged unit,I bought this handset to replace one that had been dropped one too many times.  Phone system works great
electronics,0 of 3,5.0,Excelente producto!,"Sencillamente, me ha gustado. Muy util y funcional. Sus botones para cada funcion, programa o acceso estan comodisimos!"
electronics,,4.0,Good Bluetooth Adapter,I purchased the TRENDnet Bluetooth USB adapter to get a bluetooth
electronics,1 of 3,4.0,Excellent for the price,"The sound quality is good but not great (""fuzziness"" audible), and the microphone isn't all it could be, and the comfort is also good but not great"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Nice.. with a little mistake !,Sounds best for it's dimensions. Bass blows great!
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,Cheap & wellbuilt,"This pack offers a cheap pack of 50 slim jewel cases. Buying this package with a spindle of DVDs or CDs is much cheaper than buing CDs or DVDs ready in a case. The look is cool, and these will not break easily"
electronics,,4.0,Good value memory you can get for a low price,"This one was purchased for my pocket pc, have been storing files, pictures and more important, my recordings. Clearly it's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam I got it at a really good price!"
electronics,,5.0,I was hesitant,"I bought this hesitantly knowing it got some bad reviews. But I figured I'd take my chances, which were cheaper than $30. It charges well, it's convenient, and it does what it promises. The only thing I don't love is that the cord is only about three feet long. Other than that, I've had no problems."
electronics,,1.0,Worst...Adapter...Ever,"Griffin is not lying when they say that this adapter will not work in some cassette decks.  They could have been a little more honest and said ""most"".  I can't fault them too much for this though; they at least mention this problem."
electronics,,2.0,Doesn't fit 03 Envoy,"I was so excited to get this for my iPod.  I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy.  There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit.  If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box. "
electronics,,5.0,Excellent alternative to an Ipod,"I've had my SanDisk for about 2 months now, and I love it.  I only use it while working out, so I wanted an inexpensive alternative to an Ipod.  Ipods, in my opinion, are over rated and too expensive, especially if, like me, you would only use it less than an hour a day.  I know several people who have had so many problems with their Ipods.  I have had no trouble at all with the SanDisk.  It comes with an armband, and plastic protective case to prevent the screen from getting scratched.  Its a great little player if you can't afford the hype of an Ipod"
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. I bought one and found it to be the worst investment I have ever made. The radio's light wouldn't work.  The rechargeable battery in the unit only works for a very short time after cranking. When I took a closer look at the material I found that it was made of a cheap plastic and the seams showed cheap manufacture. This radio's reception is not even as good as that of radios I've found that only cost five dollars. This radio looks like one of those that magazine companies give away with their subscription. This is a perfect example of cheap parts=maximum profits for the manufacturer of this product
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Oops! Software didn't install and user's guide is horrible, but it works.  :-)","In my previous review, I listed some problems with the IrDA device. Everything I said in my previous review is true, except I was able to sync my P/PC with the computer via IR. I just needed to look at the directions more carefully. So my new bottom line: If you want something that works well for really cheap, but don't mind not having their software installed and don't care about ill-written user's guides, then definitely go for this."
electronics,4 of 13,1.0,Break down quickly ,"I used it for a very limited period of time and then because I was busy, I did not touch it for 3 months. Today, I turn it on, it is broken! Maybe a power surge? but every electronics around it is working fine. What a piece of crap! I don't think I will buy Panasonic agai"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,TravelDock Speakers for Zen Micro,"I was pleasently surprised of the sound quality from such a small devise.  It has plently of volume without getting tingie.  I take it to the beach, on camping trips and out in the yard.  I'm glad I made this purchase. "
electronics,,2.0,Not just static - mine sometimes get the radio...,"I have had these for about month.  When I first tried them, I was very disappointed because I was picking up a radio station on them that I could hear all the time, especially between songs.  But it's become much less noticeable over time, I guess, and I haven't heard it during playback lately. So I would now give them three stars, if I were allowed to change the actual star rating. Except for occasional interference, the sound from these is good"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,I like it!,"Sorry I cannot add technical data about transfer speeds.  I have purchased more USB drives than I'll admit to and all I know is I like this one.  Why?  Because of the U3 software it comes with.  The U3 platform really makes it easy to keep your data private, as well as running some programs designed just for it (like a U3 version of Firefox).  While this Verbatim U3 Smart drive  is larger than some USB's (like the SanDisk Micro), it is very light.  I look forward to Verbatim introducing other models (2GB, etc.)"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect for the frequent traveler,"Note:  This is a review of the Targus PA225U Retractable Phone & Ethernet Cord (Plastic Casing).  It's the rectangular model, not the oval shaped one."
electronics,21 of 27,1.0,Usefulness limited by poor marketing decision,"As confirmed by CH tech support, they have decided to make their products incompatible with other manufacturer's products.  Trying to get me to spend an extra $100+ to replace my existing excellent Logitech joystick just to get their pedals to work is not a good way to get extra business.  Instead, I'm sending these back.  Hopefully, they will learn (as many others in the industry have) that trying to lock customers in to buying only your products doesn't get you more customers in the long run. Most people will choose a non-proprietary solution when they can."
electronics,0 of 2,4.0,You Get What You Pay For!,"Its Not the Greatest System out there, but for $40 what do you expect.  The sound is loud and the bass isn't bad, but if you want hard hitting bass for your music youd be better off with a real subwoofer.  I cannot complain about this system I have had it for a week and think it is a very nice system on my desk.  The 4 speakers are small and hardly noticeable which i like and the sub just goes below my desk.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I expected flatter speakers (they are about .75"" thick) and I expect just a tad bit more from the sub.  Other than that its great for games and movies and music, and what not.  So if you think this is the equivalent of a $150 speaker system then you are lost and mistaken.  If you want good bang for your buck this is a great system to get"
electronics,,1.0,Didnt last,"It worked great for the first few months but as we are nearing the 4th month, I'm so exasperated! A previous Panasonic cordless phone I had was muffled for the person I was talking to. Apparently with this phone, they can hear my clearly but I can barely hear a word they are saying! Sometimes it is really hard to hear, and other times, it is downright impossible. Either way: TERRIBLE!! It is like having your TV on volume setting 1. You can hear there is some kind of faint noise...but you just cant make out anything being said"
electronics,7 of 7,2.0,"Good for listening, not for talking.","I bought this thinking it will really save my time. But, it proved not of much use to me because the microphone seems to be not that good. The person on the other side can't hear me properly, it's feeble &amp; I have to switch back to hand-full mode instead of hands-free"

electronics,7 of 15,2.0,Not happy with this product,This product contains lead and other harmful chemicals in the gel part of the pad.  If you are allergic to lead do not buy this product.  I bought 2 for gifts and have to return them because of allergic reactions to it.  It is a good buy but not at the cost of your own health
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Awesome," I installed my radar detector last night, and was commuting from Memphis to Oxford, MS, when my new Beltronics RX65 started beeping. It informed me that it was picking up a k-Band signal. I quickly reduced my speed from around 130 to about 50, and as I crested a hill, low and behold a Mississippii state trooper had set up a speed trap. No ticket. Considering my speed, I would have been issued a huge ticket, not to mention I may have had my liscense revoked. My RX65 has allready paid for itself. ""Thanks Beltronics!"
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,A fine product,"If you're looking for a little more power out of your center channel speaker, look no further than this KLH.  It's a great speaker for the price, delivering a high-fidelity sound for much cheaper than other models out there.  I thoroughly recommend"
electronics,,4.0,Good 4x6 printer,Like the printer...good quality prints...great price.
electronics,7 of 30,2.0,Very disappointed,"Screen is blurry around the edges and corners, most obvious with text (i.e. ESPN sports ticker, movie credits, etc.).  Equally bad for satellite/cable TV, DVD, and Playstation.  Perhaps I should have returned it, but I had to destroy the box to get it home.  I do not recommend this TV.  Get a Samsung instead"
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Not worth the headache,"I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player)."
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Very cheaply made.  Try before buying.,"I thought I would love to have this radio for emergencies. It is a huge frustration. I cut my finger trying to pry open the battery compartment. My husband had to use a knife to open it. Poor quality AM and FM, and forget about shortwave. For emergency use, I want a good radio that is not a source of frustration"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Nothing beats OEM products. . .,"After ordering non-OEM inks from several different places on the web (and having some problems with them), I discovered that Amazon sold OEM at great prices."
electronics,,5.0,This is a great bag! Highly recommended.,I have 15.4' notebook that fits perfectly in the bag. The thing that impressed me the most is the design. The bag is SOooo stylish! One of my friends bought a similar one from Nordstroms for $200. The bag is also light and has multiple compartments. It's really a steal.

electronics,11 of 12,5.0,"Excelent, just excelent",This camera is awesome. It comes w/ a headset too that you can use when not using the webcam itself. The built in microphone is perfect allowing you to sit back and relax w/o being too close to the camera. The image is clear though it takes awhile to get the focus if you are moving too much (like when you are showing something using your webcam) but in real usage (just video phone) it is perfect. I love it and almost got another one for my family
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,"DON'T GET THIS JUNK, it breaks, no customer service","I got two of these last year for our family, it worked great the first day, then the ear phone port broke on one, the other lasted only a few days longs.  I called the company and found almost no customer service, they said I had to deal with the company directly, but offered no other help (like how to contact them).  They both ended up in the garbage and we were out the money.  This year we are spending a few more bucks and getting from a reputable company.  If there were minus stars, I would give them a -1"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Sony Bean,"I just ordered the second one for our family.  It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould.  They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use.  The software is simple.  The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time.  My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have.  Mom loves that they're affordable"
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,Releases me from my computer,Nice product as far as it goes. I can now connect to Skype and landline using my domestic cordless phone. Easy to install and works reliably. The only BUT in this is that you still need to have the computer switched on and logged in to get to your Skype account.

electronics,,5.0,Logitech V200 Mouse is very good,I bought Logitech V200 mouse from Amazon and it is really a compact size and working fine. I am really enjoying this mouse.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great product,"I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Good but I've switched now to a wireless mouse,"I like this mouse as far as they go, but I found the cord annoying so I switched to a Kensington wireless mouse that I love"
electronics,1 of 3,5.0,"works great, good price","Great price for a 128MB jump drive, works perfectt for my daughters college work, such a good price I bought "
electronics,,5.0,cable,this type of cable solved my problem of not being able to connect my gps to an older laptop that did not have a db9 port. Very inexpensive problem solver. 
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,"Fast, Affordable Backup Solution",Took this with me on a 4 week trip and it worked flawlessly. My goal was to back up the SD Cards from my two cameras every day. I brought a USB SD Card reader and plugged it in and then put the cards in there. Backup was very fast.
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,GREAT AM AND FM RECEPTION--CLEAR EVEN NEAR MOUNTAINS!,"This radio picks up AM and FM stations and this is miracle as I live in a mountain area and Sony is the only brand of radio that does this. And what is even better, this radio picks up more AM AND FM stations (and longer range),than my old Radio Shack, Panasonic, etc radios. Mostly these only pick up FM. Since I love talk radio shows and they are on AM, I really appreciate this radio. The others I own are just sitting in a drawer! I rate this radio a 5 because:"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Left handed - you will love it...  ,"I've bought this item, because I got tired using a mouse for touch up on images I use on my website.  The tablet and pen is amazing and so easy to use.  Just plug into your USB port and you are up and running.  It works with all Windows applications and you do not need to install the software.  Best of all it is so slim and light, you can carry it with your laptop anywhere.  Overall it took me only 2 minutes to get a feel for it.  I first wanted to buy the smaller tablet, but the reviews said go for the lager one.  Quite honest the small one probably would have worked just fine since I don't use the entire tablet at all.  Just remember the larger the tablet the further you have to move your hand from left to right of your screen.  You can define the area of use on the tablet so you do not have to move the entire hand across the surface.  One thing that was confusing was the combination pack of mouse and pen.  I worried that I cannot use my regular mouse once installed.  I'm left handed and the included mouse and pen only work on the tablet.  I wanted to use the mouse with the right hand on the right side of the keyboard, and the pen/tablet with the left hand on the left side of the keyboard.  It was not clear on Amazon or Wacoms website how this would work.  I've called Wacom and they told me that I don't have to use the mouse that comes with it.  They merely sell it bundled due to popular request.  As a result I use my wireless Microsoft mouse on the right and the tablet with the pen on the left side of the keyboard.  Just the way I wanted it.  I found out that I can work really efficiently using the mouse and pen at the same time.  I don't think a right handed person can do this, unless he/she learns to either use the mouse or the pen with the other hand.  Any left handed person will love this.  I don't think that this item is only for pros.  Anyone that plays a lot with images for websites will love it.  Touch up is now fast and easy. "
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent value for money,"The quality of the sound is very good indeed, I would say crystal clear. They were also a very good bargain. The design is also very different. The only disadnantage I have noticed, is that they do not have a on / off switch."
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,So far so good....,"I got this player a month back and so far I am satisfied with the product, except for the fact that it is 128MB only. I take it to my GYM everyday and enjoy my workout with my favorite music"
electronics,,5.0,"These are ""all that""...","The main purpose for me purchasing these was to replace my Sony Active Noise canceling headphones.  The Sony's are great, but take up a lot of space.  After all reading all the reviews it was a toss up between these and the E3C-Ns.  I bought these (first)."
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,"OK, there may be much better notebook speakers out there soundwise, but they are indeed costly.  Besides, when I bought Logitechs, they had a promotional discount that made them even better value than they already are.  And there is also their small size and smart case, which allows carrying the speakers in my notebook backpack without sacrificing much space"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Great for Price,"I bought this DVD in January 2006 and have not regretted to this day.  There is the issue of the eject button being absent but then again, when you eject via remote control, you still have to get up to get the DVD out of the player so maybe it is not so necessary to have an eject button.  I've had no problems with this player playing my home made DVDs unlike others.  It is a bit difficult to set up but besides that it is a great purchase"
electronics,,5.0,"Versatile: 5 Buttons, USB/PS2, Ambidextrous (symmetrical)","This is my current favorite mouse.  I've been using them for probably five years now, on every machine I own (and several I don't).  It has two buttons on top plus the scroll wheel (not a newer tilting one, just a straight up-down scrolling action) plus two buttons on the sides, which provide forward/backward browser functionality (like hitting Alt-Arrows).  The software makes most of these programmable.  "
electronics,,5.0,Tripp Lite Home Theater Surge Protector (HT10DBS),"This surge protector was recommended by several audio and home theatre internet sites. It's solid in construction and is aesthetically pleasing. There are three indicator lights that serve as a heads up as to wether the surge protector is working properly or not. The 10 outlets are labeled (DVD, Amp, receiver,CBL/SAT, etc.). It also comes with additional labels if you have two of any electronic device or do not like the label arrangment on the surge protector. The outlets are spaced out so its easy to fit as many as 6 transformers onto the surge protector. On the side of the surge protector are inputs for a phoneline and an internet line. The device also allows protection for up to three coaxial cables. The output Watt capacity is 1440 watts. This surge protector has allowed me to safely and adequately protect everything in my room. It is great if you want  to organize all the wires behind a desk or TV/audio stand. I am thoroughly impressed with the device and would recommend it to anyone"
electronics,26 of 27,5.0,Works great for me,"I have an unusual set up.  Only 1 HDMI input on my tv (42"" plasma EDTV) and 2 HDMI out devices (Comcast HD cable box and Toshiba DVD player with HD upconversion).  I also have the Bose Cinemate audio system which ONLY has RCA inputs and has only ONE input (terrible design, I know)."

electronics,5 of 7,4.0,Wide screen issues,"This recorder is basically great, however, I have some issues when I replay the DVDs in a different DVD player."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Pretty good deal,"First: these headphones aren't orange, they're pink. The speakers on these phones look forward, they're not turned into your ear, so they don't have the volume they might if they faced the ear canal(if you press on them they are loud). This actually may be a good thing, since they are easier on the ear than some other kinds. They are econonomical in the power they consume; they'll run all day on one battery. The sound is good, not great - these are low-cost headphones, so let's not expect audiophile quality. That said, they are quite acceptable. THEY STAY ON YOUR EAR. For me, they are just fine"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Perfectly good headset,I have not had any trouble at all with this headset.  I like the in-line mute switch because my phone does not have a mute button.
electronics,5 of 6,4.0,Good sounding speakers for the price,"Nice compact size, great if you're tight on space. Surprising amount of bass (actually a little too much, you'll find yourself turning the bass knob down), nice highs, plenty of volume, and they look pretty good too."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Love this phone!,"We've had this phone for over a year with an additional handset.  I LOVE the different rings you can program!  When my husband get's work calls, it rings different than when a family member calls.  So my young kids know not to answer the phone if it's daddy's work!  When the kids friends call, the Old McDonald Farm song rings, they get so excited when they hear it.  "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great calculator,"I purchased this calculator for an MBA program. The functions are diverse and appropriate. Like other HPs I have owned in the past, the menu is nested and takes some time to learn. Solve function allows you to enter custom equations and solve for any unknown given the other parameters. The unit is not as solid as prior HPs but is still leaps ahead of comparable TI units"
electronics,,4.0,very good,"I am very happy with this product.  I wish it would have come with  better directions, however was able to unload them from the internet"
electronics,2 of 4,5.0,Great product,"Took it out of the box, connected the cables and it worked. No software to install. Had a Linksys router and nothing but trouble, had to keep rebooting. D-Link is performing trouble free and again an extremely easy installation"

electronics,,5.0,Nice,"I have four of these, one for each member of my family.  Primarily, we use them for listening to DVDs and Internet broadcasts on our computers, as well as for Internet telephony.  I even got one for a partner who uses it for speech recognition on his computer.  I think they are terrific-high quality audio and an accurate, non-distorted microphone.  Although one of them was defective (the volume control did not work correctly), Amazon's response was first-rate.  They replaced it with no fuss, muss or bother (or cost, for that matter, since they paid for the UPS pickup).  I might still get a smaller set for travel.  Also, the cord is a little skinny and so is more prone to damage.  But otherwise, a nice unit and a good value"
electronics,,5.0,Works at Court...,"Use these to communicate in a Courthouse made of a lot of cement, stone, and metal.  They do the trick economically"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Awesome Value!! Highly Recommend!,"I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent card.,"I had to find a card, that would provide a strong enough signal, to solidify my connection, at a location on the fringe of a service area, and just outside of the range of standard cards.  The DWL-G550 came with an external antenna and ~10' of cable.  The connector on the back of the card is a standard SMA connector that allows you to use the Hawking high gain antenna for extended range.  I have used the 15dBi, 14dBi, and the 9dBi antennae with this card and have had great success with them.  I discovered that the antenna that D-Link supplied with this card works well with a clear line of sight for extended distances and does well in areas where there is an obstructed line of sight.  I have since purchased 5 more of these cards and will use the D-Link DWL-G550 whenever I have to go wireless with a desktop.  The drivers and software are excellent, providing a clear, easy-to-use interface.  It even works with NetStumbler, which makes monitoring WiFi conditions a breeze.   "
electronics,6 of 6,1.0,"Too big for the item it's supposed to protect, and the latch breaks too easily","A few years back I had a Palm m515 and Palm's hard case for that model PDA and I loved them both. The hard case was well-made and fit the PDA snugly, protecting the PDA quite well from bumps and the occasional drop."
electronics,6 of 13,1.0,SLO-O-O-O-W,"Bought one for my Treo 650.  Read speed seems OK, but the write speed is horrible!  When using voice recording software, the card was too slow to properly write the .wav files, and everything I recorded was garbled and useless.  When doing my daily data backup, the process took at least 10x as long as with my SanDisk card.  Even the garbage no-name card that I got free with my Treo is dramatically faster."
electronics,1 of 15,2.0,Is good but not that good.,"After using this tablet about 4 months now I had experimented with all of its functions but still not satisfy me because I tough that this tablet will show what you draw on it, this is not posible because in what you draw is a solid grey color plastic cover that feels the magnetic point of the pen and then projects the image on the computer screen. I'm  disappointed because I paid to much money for what is not a valuable product at all. You can buy it but I do not recomend it for serious animators or serios artist who want to see what they are drawing on the tablet surface"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,"Ok Sound quality, poor life","This mic lasted me only 10 months and I had bought it for $[a good price]. The sound quality is ok and you need to tune it through your audio wizard or sound can be very distorted. As someone else mentioned it was not a very good mic to use with speech recognition software but ok for conversations. Howerver, it just stopped working one day"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,"Excellent Clarity, nice features","The cam did a really nice job keeping me in touch with my wife who was away for 5 days as part of her Phd program.  The kids and I could see and hear her clearly.  The only draw back I think for all these notebook cams is the way they mount to the laptop, they have a tendency to slip off easily if the edge of the laptop is rounded over as her is.  My compaq presario is more of a square edge and does not preset an issue.  The camera even has face tracking software to keep the persons face in the shot.."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,My Favorite Headphones,These are my favorite headphones. Comfortable and good sound quality. They break a little easily but that is my only complaint. Good value for the price
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,great commuter headphone,"this headphone has great bass and seals out external noise. folds up and stores in a bag. highly recommended. also recommended by headroom the headphone amp people, check out their web site"
electronics,24 of 24,4.0,"Very cool, but maps could be more up to date","I bought one of these for my new Palm TX after seeing it work on a friend's Palm T5.  It is a very cool product and is as easy to use as I anticipated.  I've had a lot of fun with it already, navigating familiar routes around town.  The GPS device (at least in my case) finds satellites (as many as 8) in less than a minute and the Bluetooth connection works fine.  It runs at least 2 hours before needing a recharge if you're using it outside of a car.  The GPS unit is small enough for a pocket if you're walking or cycling.  A cable is provided so you can keep it on charge in your car.  My main interest is in using it while on the road in strange cities while using a rental car.  I'm now quite convinced it will do that task well.  The voice direction feature is very effective and only makes itself known when course changes are coming up.  This generally eliminates any need to look at the PDA while driving, although a pedestal is included for mounting the PDA for quick glances.  If you leave your planned route, the software rapidly recalculates to provide new suggested routing.  This is a good thing, since the maps are not as up to date as I would have expected.  There is a selection of voices in English, plus many more in foreign languages.  I should also note that the software will run in full screen mode on the TX, either portrait or landscape and will recognize graffiti, although not caps for some reason."
electronics,,1.0,didn't work,"It simply didn't work for me. I am in Washington DC area and not sure if it was because the FM signals are too jammed. But it just didn't work. After I tried many times, I gave up. Also too bad, it was after 30 days so I couldn't return"

electronics,6 of 6,1.0,AWFUL PRODUCT! DEFECTIVE MANUAL! DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE! DEFECTIVE DEVICE!,"I have purchased hundreds of products on Amazon, and this is the worst!  The price was great, and, of course, it was too good to be true.  I purchased five of these, thinking my friends would love them.  The manual is a small piece of paper that refers to an install directory that doesn't exist (and also assumes that your CD-ROM is your ""G"" drive).  The set-up drivers were referred to as being for a device with a serial port, and this is supposed to be a USB device!  The SIM card could not fully seat in the device.  Of course, the device could not be seen by my computer.  I was just thankful that this piece of junk did not trash my SIM card, and cause me to lose all of my addresses.  I found this item elsewhere on the internet as a closeout, I think someone is just trying to dump some worthless junk.  This is my first negative review of a product on eBay.  People deserve to be warned about this product"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Just get a pair already,"Mine cost $17 with free shipping. I'd have been satisfied had they simply been adequate, but I was very surprised. They ain't audiophile, but they also sound like ""real cans"", as good or better than the competition costing 3X as much."
electronics,34 of 34,4.0,"Good buy, but price misleading","Like everyone else, I hate Apple's not including an AC adapter with the iPod and then charging $30 to get one. And, like many here, I was hesitant to buy a $3 charger since it might ruin my $250 nano. But it isn't a $3 charger. It's more like a $6-10 charger when you add in the ""shipping"" -- roughly $7.50 for one and $10.50 for two, which is really shipping, handling and profit. Even at those prices, it's much better than Apple and I like the design even better (roughly half the size and one third the weight. Given the small power output, that shouldn't be a problem and is better when traveling. Apple's adapter is almost as big as the one for my iBook and that uses many times the power of an iPod charger. "
electronics,,5.0,Great sound!,Enjoy the speakers.  My games sound cool!!  My videos that I record sound great with the 5.1 sound when played back.  Excellent choice for  Multi-Media Center computers!!
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,CTA Digital 4 AA NiMH 2400mAh Batteries with charger ( DC-1HK24 ),"Works OK. The batteries do get hot by the end of the charging period and it takes about 15 min to let them cool down by themselves. I don't know how long they would last if charged so quick but so far they look fine and the price of similar batteries is cheap. This is not an extremely ""smart"" charger (special wave cycle, etc.) but it works"
electronics,4 of 5,1.0,Doesnt improve picture,"Before I purchased this PowerCenter HTS800, a problem I had was when I would turn on my DVD player or PS2 or Surond System, you would see the interference it caused when turned on and off.  I cant even watch tv with having the surrond system on because it created such annoying interference.  My main problem was certain channels had snowy interference, lines going up and down and overall noticeable interference.  These channels were the ones my programs came on and liked to tape.  I was sick of looking at a dirty picture so I decided to look at what Monstercable offered as a remedy already knowing that its the most expensive but has the reputation as being the best there is.   So I found this PowerCenter HTS 800 and read the description and customer reviews and made the choice of spending the money because of the positive feedback. I also thought that my problem was also caused by the coax cables I used so I also ordered 3 Monster Standard THX Certified F-Pin Coax 8ft Cables to replace the ones I used.  I recieved the PowerCenter first so I  hooked it up to my TV, DVD player, VCR, Surrond Sound System & PS2.   Also took the main coax cable into the PowerCenter HTS800 Coax IN and my no name brand F-pin Coax Cable from the PowerCenter Coax OUT to the VCR IN and my no name brand F-Pin Coax Cable from the VCR OUT to my JVC 27in Flatscreen TV.  I had made sure all the wires were not touching or close together in any way for all the components buy using twisty ties you use for plastic bags etc. and a staple gun to seperate each wire in back of my entertainment center.  Absolutely had NO DIFFERENCE in picture, everything that was happening before was still present so that told me that this product was no different then the yellow power strip I've used for over 10 years.  Complete waste of money.  But when I recieved the F-Pin Coax Cables a few days later, I did a quick experiment to convince myself that the Powercenter HTS800 was complete garbage.  I unhooked the PowerCenter from all my electronic components and rehooked up my old yellow power strip.  Then I replaced all F-Pin Coax Cables with the new Monster Cable Coax Cables.  Again I had made sure all the wires were not touching or close together.  BINGO!!!!!!!  No more dirty picture on my favorite channels and all other channels.  It was clearly the old Coax Cables I used that caused the picture interference.  Also, I could now watch my tv programs with surround sound because the picture interference that was caused when my surround system was on for watching regular tv was gone.  The new MonsterCables solved my problem.  I highly recommend MonsterCable for their cables but not the powerstrips they make.  They are no diiferent then a Belkin or no name brand"
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Think this one through,"1. This worked for me and transmitted forty feet, but only after I attached a spool of copper wire to the antenna, after prying open the case. I had to adjust the wire till reception cleared. Otherwise it was static. Before the copper wire, I had static in an FM receiver one foot from the Griffin Rocket antenna."
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,"Horrible, tinny sound","Being a bit picky, I don't normally get something like this without being able to try it first, but I decided for the price, and based on the generally positive reviews here, I'd give them a try.  I didn't expect to have any problems with them other than fit."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,HUGE DIFFERENCE !!!!!!!,I USED TO HAVE MONSTER CABLE S-VIDEO.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,awesome TV!,"I upgraded from a Toshiba 48"" projection TV. It's like the difference between night & day. Picture is superb! And it is certainly a problem that I have now been watching too much TV since I got this, it is hard to turn it off."
electronics,,4.0,useful telephone,large buttons are helpful in dialing. The price is right and delivery is prompt
electronics,,1.0,Cheap for a reason -- It doesn't like paper,"At first I was happy to be able to purchase a printer for such a low price.  However, the price should be even lower for this pile of junk.  Every time I attempt to print, I spend several minutes trying to feed it paper.  The printer will intake several pieces of paper at the same time instead of just one, and it will jam up.  Even if I just feed it one piece of paper at a time, it will often still jam on just one piece of paper.  Printing should not be this hard.  These problems have occurred since I first purchased the printer.  I regret purchasing this printer, as I should have went with a higher end model.  I've lost respect for HP products because of the poor quality of this printer"
electronics,,5.0,These speakers are amazing,"I first saw these speakers at the Apple store, and i really liked the sound and the look.  I went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them.  As long as you have a decent soundcard, these speakers really are great.  i have had no problem with them at all, they look really cool, they're loud, they're small, the woofer gives you a lot of bass (which you can turn down), and the sound from the speakers is clear.  buy these"
electronics,,5.0,Battery works as it should have from the start,This battery works well as it should have from the start.  Apparantly the originals were not good
electronics,,5.0,Gem of a monitor,"This monitor may not have all the features of pricier models (there are no attached USB ports for one) but the color resolution, at least to my eyes, is spectacular"
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Reliability problems,"Nice features but poor construction--mine broke after about three months of normal use.  The connection (in the remote) went bad, so I now only get sound in one earphone.  There's no warranty to speak of"
electronics,2 of 6,5.0,Photo Cyan Ink Tank,It's ink. It makes pictures. It goes in my printer. I don't really know what else to say. It tastes a lot better than the generic version too
electronics,,5.0,Chill Pad,"Arrived on time and in excellant condition. It works very well, my laptop is much more comfortable to use"
electronics,,5.0,Mine works exceptionally well,I've been using one that I purchased at Radio Shack and the quality and performance were very lacking. There was a big and noticeable improvement with the Kensington model vs. the one from Radio Shack especially in the quality of the Kensington. The signal strength accuracy always matches what my laptop tells me in my personal tests so I'm confident enough it will perform the same anywhere that I may need to use it. It sure helps knowing you have a decent Wi-Fi signal first before taking your laptop out of it's case and powering it up. Perhaps there's been some bad units out there previously as some of the reviews suggest but I must say I'm fortunate that mine works as specified and I'm glad to have it
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,worth it,"hp makes great stuff that works like a charm with mac.  i have 2 other hp printers. the extra warranty purchase , in one case , came in handy, as one of the other 2 broke before the warranty expired. they gave me a new printer. that does not diminish hp quality as printers seem to wear out rather fast, according to eveyone i know. that also is a good reason to spend as little as possible on one. so, good choice, little buck"
electronics,3 of 8,5.0,Satisfied!,I just make it very short!
electronics,4 of 7,1.0,"No bass, muddied, flat treble, no midrange, no good - these things are junk.","I bought these bacause of the good reviews; I was amazed upon getting an iPod that the 'phones included with it have so little volume and so little bass.  (I am especially annoyed with that, the whole 'no bass' thing; I love rock and roll and I love it loud and punchy as I ride that mountain bike). Anyways, I got these and found that they fit well in my ear, looked forward to comparing with the other phones I purchased at the same time, to test them out against the inexpensive Philips phones, the best I'd found thus far."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great but expensive and rebate is running slow.,"If you own an AXIM X5, running Pocket PC 2003, then this is the wireless LAN card for you plus it has a low profile to boot.  The Socket card can also be used on your laptop along with a generic CF to PCMCIA adapter.  I am not sure how efficient it is but I can leave my AXIM on, all settings at minimum power, and connected for at least four hours"
electronics,1 of 5,1.0,AWFUL SHIPPING,Never buy from amazon. At least i wont ever again. payed for the best shipping on october 5th. its the 14th now and my item STILL HAS NOT ARIVED. its in NJ. been there for 3 days now. And amazon didnt even ship it out till the 10th of october!!! A DAY AFTER THERE ESTIMATE OF IT GETTING TO ME!
electronics,31 of 34,4.0,is it necessary?,"Before you shell out big bucks for these, ask yourself if it is really necessary. Because I am a sucker for perfection, I went out and purchased them. Did I see a HUGE improvement in picture quality compared to another brand of component video cable I was using? No. At least not on my 27&quot; SONY WEGA tv. Okay, maybe the black levels are a bit better. I got these because I do believe better cables last a lot longer than cheaper-made ones. In addition, because I have so MANY cables running from my reciever, I figured cables with better jackets and good sheilding should cut back on video interference, producing better quality pictures"
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,"value for money, nice sound quality, good for laptop","bought these speakers for $9.99 with free shipping. good deal, nice speakers with bettter than expected sound quality, but these might not be for you if you are looking for bass/treble controls and very high quality sound from $10 speakers"
electronics,,4.0,Good - But?,I use them on the treadmill and they stay in my ears - but occasionally the long cord tangles with my arm or hand - and pulls one of the headphones out.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Really Nice To Have,"This has been working great for me. The headphones aren't the best so it sounds a whole lot better with good ones. Once the USB stick has been formatted on a Windows machine, files (audio or other) are easily transferred using a Mac in OSX. Having the removable USB stick to transfer files between computers is a huge bonus"
electronics,3 of 11,1.0,Don't waste your money or sanity,"This is the 3rd and 4th D-Link product I have bought.  Not one of them work properly. Media Centre took 8 hours to set up wirelessly and still requires manual reconfiguring, D-Link Wireless USB requires constant re-setting. Just received 2 x DCS900W Internet Cameras. First one set up reasonable easilly . The second one I have spent an entire 8 hours on, and still the D-Link setup software will not even recognise the hardware. Whatever you do - don't buy this product - or if you insist on wasting your money, make sure you have a hammer to smash it with after wasting days in futile efforts to set them up"
electronics,,4.0,Good value for the money,"I wanted a digital cable to connect my dvd player (inexpensive, but decent) to my receiver. Although I could have used an optical digital cable, since my receiver has 2 optical inputs and the dvd player comes with both optical and coax audio outs, I decided to get the coax, since it is sturdier than the optical cables. The sound seems crisp and clear to me, and I have had no problems with any interference with the TV picture, which one reviewer insists must happen any time anyone uses this cable to hook up their dvd player--I'm sorry he has had problems with his set up, but I have had none, and, contrary to his assertion in his review that no one who reviews this cable positively could ever have used it, I have used no other cable with my dvd player and have encountered no problems. (Did he possibly try to use it to connect his DVD player to the video-in of his TV?"
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,Do not believe the hype,"To address a previous poster's concerns - they are baseless - this unit works fine with HTML, TXT and other formats."
electronics,5 of 17,5.0,theirs nothing wrong with typewriters,This is the kind of thing I love to use if I get tired of typing on the computer or if my printer has ran out of Ink. A lot of people have forgotten that typewriters still exist I haven't. This run's on electric so at least its not a 1950's machine. It returns by it self so you can start the next colume of typing. I also use some white paper fill with chalk to erase some words. Typewriting is what I first had to learn in school before I had to take a computer class
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,5 years on one cartridge!,"This toner is great. I have had the printer for 5 years and this is the first time I've had to replace the toner...and I don't scrimp on printing. I print checks, graphics, letters, reports, etc. I am very pleased with the  quality and quantity"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Perfect multi-purpose pack,"I purchased this backpack for school, and I love it.  Its rated for a 17"" laptop, but I haul around my 13"" MacBook, along with all my textbooks, notebooks, and folders for college.  What's more, with all the space this backpack allows, it doubles as a weekend pack for carrying clothes, etc, if I go hiking, or just if I want to pack light when we hit the road to visit family out-of-state."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,"Incompatible with 13"" MacBook, hard to operate","I just bought one of these at our University Bookstore, and returned it a week later. "
electronics,,5.0,Great Buy and Great Price,The Linksys LNE100TX EtherFast 10/100 LAN Card is exactly what I wanted at a great price.  Fast shipping too!
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Small Size, Sounds Great, and Low Price","This device is built solid, looks great, sounds great, and has fantastic battery life.  The integration with iTunes is simple and easy to use.  Apple has raised the bar with this new device"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,Don't Do It!!!!!!!!,"This product is amazing - when it works. Which for me, was two months and why it gets two stars. I originally gave it one, but when it does work it really is awesome, absolutely no complaints. Mine froze and died two months after I opened the package. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it fixed because it was a gift from an ex who I was no longer in contact with by the time it broke. After it froze I frantically scoured the web trying to find a way to reset it. That didn't work. I changed the batteries, etc etc it was just dead. I thought about buying another one until I read all the reviews with similar complaints. I am not an Apple person, but since that is all there seems to be I finally gave in last night and bought one and so far I love it. I initially resisted because of the software (I thought I hated iTunes) but I am getting used to it and liking it! So this is probably not what you want to hear, but this is my advice - skip this and buy yourself an ipod just like everyone else. There is a reason it is so popular!!"
electronics,,5.0,Patch Panel,Product was exactly as specified by the part number and shipping was speedy
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,Great product. ,I bought this for my son who uses it with his IPOD. The quality audio and bass is great. 
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Love this little guy!,"I received this item as a Christmas gift (I actually picked it out myself) and I absolutely love it!  It's never given me any problems at all, and I have used it every day since Christmas 2005. Some of the reviews say that their unit shorted out. I always make sure I put my iPod in the cradle when the unit and the iPod are both off, but that is not a hard thing to do. I love the fact that I can take my iPod from room to room, and that my iPod is kept at a full charge.  The sound is excellent for such a small unit, whether you're playing Beethoven or Blue Oyster Cult. The unit is solid to give resonance, but the footprint is small. Yes, the adapter is a bit large and clunky, but it still fits every plug in my apartment.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone who wants decently priced portable speakers for their iPod, that has a dock and charges the iPod all in one.  Do yourself a favor tho and shop around, as this is not the best price I've seen"
electronics,2 of 6,5.0,Very responsive and helpful and fair minded,These people were great and responsive and helpful
electronics,6 of 8,5.0,Great Antenna!!,"I have bought different antenna's and found this one to work the best.  A couple of the channels do not come in as perfectly as the others and that is even after having to adjust the rabbit ears.  No antenna is going to work the same as cable, but this is a nice alternative if you want to get local channels without having to pay a company for service.  You should be aware that this antenna requires to be plugged into an electrical outlet to operate.  The price is very reasonable for the quality, considering without it I would only receive half of the channels.  I do have cable for my widescreen in the living room and use this for my small dvd tv in the bedroom, as a backup.  A larger more expensive antenna may work slightly better, but obviously would not fit on the tv and cheaper antenna's that are smaller than this one do not work at all for some stations"
electronics,3 of 6,2.0,Not for most iPAQs,"This case will not work with most iPAQ PDAs because it is designed for iPAQs with a side hinging cover.  The case actually attaches to the hinge of the cover, thereby replacing whatever cover was on the PDA.  Unfortunately, my hx2755 has a cover that hinges from the top, so this case won't really work for it.  Its a tight squeeze with the cover attached for my PDA to fit, but it does have some room for a few credit cards and maybe some SD cards"
electronics,,2.0,Incompatible with other vendors; poor signal quality,This is my second disappointment with Linksys products.
electronics,5 of 5,4.0,Awesome sound quality.,"Great sound quality for the cost.   Be sure to keep the speaker away from the wall 1-2 feet for best sound quality.   One negative I have with this unit is it disables the volume control on the I-Pod when it is dock.   Example I have a remote control installed on my I-pod, I can change and mute songs, but I can not adjust the volume from the remote.    "
electronics,,1.0,Worst buy I ever made!,I've used fans for cooling and as white noise for sleeping and bought this fan 2 weeks ago for that purpose.  The fan circulated air very poorly even at high speed and that speed burned out the first night.  It made no noise at all.  I continued to use it but last night (night 14) it quit completely.  Given more options I would rate this with MINUS 5 stars.  DO NOT BUY!
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Verbatim is the very best.,"Howdy, I have always used these Verbatim DVDs with my Plextor drives and had very few fail me. If they did fail, it was usually a software or bad setting on my part. Yes, they may cost a little more, but you do truely get what you pay for."
electronics,,1.0,too bad.i got it today and want to return it.,"I really don't understand why there are so many mixed reviews which will fool other consumers.This speaker is reaaly disapointting,especially with bass.The bass will come out as very unclear noises,even with light bass songs,the quality is also too bad,i cannot bear it.I have just received it for one day,and i have decided i will definetely return them"
electronics,,2.0,"Worked for a while, but...","At first this product was a great way to play all my music in my car, but after a while it started to cut the music in and out. I thought it was just mine that was doing this, therefore, I considered getting another one, but other people I knew where having the same problem. Since I haven't found any other solution to playing my iPod in my car this is unfortunately my only option."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Very good value,"I got one of these at work a few months ago (I'm a full-time programmer).  I like it a lot.  It has good action, is quiet, has standard placement for the cursor control keys between the numeric keypad and the regular keys (2 rows of 3, not 3 rows of 2 like many others)."
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Garmin usb18,Product did not work had to send back to manufacture to be replaced
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Easy fix for problem with Caller ID call backs,"Yes, it is true the phone does not save a ""1"" in front of the CID area code.  However, all you need to do when you pull up the CID number you want to dial is press ""*"". That will force a ""1"" before the area code. Presto"
electronics,,5.0,Great product!,"These little guys are great!  They just screw on..no crimping is required!  I originally installed them to get my system working.  Once everything was good, I took them off to remove the extra wire I had installed ""just in case"".  It literally takes two minutes to install these"
electronics,,4.0,CL-41 cartridge for Canon Pixma IP1600,"New cartridge had been received on time and well packed, easily installed."
electronics,,5.0,So far excellent,"We bought this phone to replace a very poor pair of DXI 986 phones from Uniden (see my review).  When choosing the Vtech, we also wanted to avoid purchasing from Uniden because of a couple of bad customer service experiences with them. "
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Not worth the headache,"I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player)."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Nobody agrees on the fit!,"I've tried all types of lightweight headphones and I have a very difficult time with finding a pair that will stay put without causing pain.  For me, these work better than any other headphone design.  Period."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent value for money,This is a great webcam for its price. I got this camera for a final price of $13 (after a $25 MIR).
electronics,3 of 4,1.0,Wouldn't recommend ...,"Although the sound is decent, I agree with many of the other reviewers' thoughts on these headphones.  They too often fall off the ear and when they do stay on are easily rattled around.  The clip is very awkward and only pulls the phones off the ear when one extends/rotates their torso.  Shortly after purchasing mine, the rubber-coating on one of the wires inadvertently split open, revealing the leads.  The sound was eventually lost in that earpiece.  I would suggest looking eleswhere for quality headphones for exercising"
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Poor reception,"I have this on a desktop with Win XP.  This adapter goes through cycles of good to poor reception repeatedly.  It will occasionally drop the connection.  Whereas, my 2 laptops placed at the same location receives excellent signal constantly.  Go figure"
electronics,,5.0,Very good backpack! ,"I love it, it is comfortable and neat and big enough for 15.4"" laptop"
electronics,19 of 20,1.0,Caution - not compatible with RC 930 wireless modem system,I wanted to add an additional extension to my RC 930 wireless modem. This was the only RCA extension unit that I could find so I ordered it. I now know that the RCA wireless phone and modem systems are not compatible. RCA confirmed this over the phone and also said that the modem extensions are not sold separately
electronics,,5.0,Griffin RoadTrip,Great product - a little bulky - sweet to use with radio in my house though. 
electronics,,5.0,Working flawlessly,This router has worked flawlessly.  I had another name brand router that I had to reset continuously to get connected to the network. That router's WAN port stopped communicating (it broke).  I have not reset this router since it was plugged in. I am very satisfied and happy.
electronics,,4.0,Great Buy!,These headphones are definitely worth buying at the price.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,These headphones REALLY cancel noise!,"I bought these phones last year in Seattle airport on my way back to Brussels. When one frequently spends 8-12 hours on overnight flights, these Bose headphones are fantastic. The low frequency engine noise on aircraft is completely gone. I even keep them on sleeping and you feel much better when you get off the plane in Europe at 7am local time."
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Hello in there!!,I had the mouse for about two months and it broke. I sent it back to iogrear and after a couple of weeks I received a mouse back but I think it was a refurb. That one worked for awhile and now the scroll wheel doesn't work. In my opinion it is a waste of money
electronics,9 of 11,4.0,Too sensitive for its price but excellent customer support,"A couple of months after I bought it, the left side started to malfunction producing a very annoying sound.  However, customer support replaced the whole product at a very convenient and fast way."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,No Problems,This ink cartridge is exactly what you would expect.  Quality ink at the typical price.  I do not purchase ink refills or knock-offs.  I have not had much luck with them
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Buy HIGH SPEED for PSP,"The guy who said it doesn't matter if you get the high speed card or the regular card for your PSP is wrong.  This card is 5 times faster than the MSX-M1GS.  While you can't see the difference when you are just playing games on your PSP, you will see it when you are transferring data from your PC to the PSP.  To transfer 800 MB of data with this card takes about 2 minutes.  With the slow card it takes about 10 minutes...... that's a big difference.  Now, I'm using a USB 2.0 connection.  If you are using a USB 1 connection, then you won't reap the benefits of this card cause it's too slow."
electronics,5 of 6,2.0,"Sturdy, but otherwise not that great",I've been using these headphones for a few months at the gym.
electronics,12 of 12,4.0,Faster Satilite Connection,"I use the magnetic mount to put the antenna on the roof of my truck.  I usually am READY TO NAVIGATE by the time I turn out of my driveway.  Also, I never loose satelite connection while I am driving because of trees or tall buildings. A GREAT improvement over the units antenna"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Quality Home Office Phone,"Hard to find a quality phone these days. This Panasonic does all the basics required for a home office, including a decent speakerphone. Note that the speakerphone uses AA batteries, not an AC adaptor. Phone does NOT need batteries to work as basic phone. Recommended, but only appears to be sold online"
electronics,,5.0,A Solution That Works,"I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) "
electronics,,5.0,Highest quality and makes ink waterproof!,"I'm a professional graphic artist, and I've used this paper for about 10 years since I purchased my first Epson printer. It produces, by far, the highest quality photographic images over every paper I've used including Kodak, Canon, HP, and Kirkland papers. So what sets it apart? (and makes it more expensive?) This paper has a chemical coating on the surface that sets inkjet die virtually on contact. So prints on Epson photo paper are smudge-free and able to be handled right out of the printer. The chemical is why you have to store this paper in its self-sealing pouch until use, because it will otherwise evaporate. But what most people don't know, is that it also makes inkjet dies nearly waterproof. I've actually run a print under the faucet, and when it dried, it was completely unharmed. On other papers, the print was destroyed. This might not seem that important, but it makes your prints resistant to fingerprints and accidental spills"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Epson inks for R1800,"Great product in every respect, but I have to complain about the cost. Ink of this type should not cost soo very much"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"Just like ""real"" photos",If it had a faint logo on the back like real photo paper no one would know the difference!  This paper and the Epson Stylus Photo 960 are an excellent combination
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Can't do much better for the price,"I've had this unit for about a year and have been generally satisfied with the unit.  I use it as a TV and PC using a TV card.  The display is quite bright and the colors are vivid.  The only technical problem I've had has been with red static, which I think is my video card more than the TV.  However it's easily corrected by changing the color depth lower and then changing it back.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Olevia, despite not being a major brand"
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,Great Voice Recorder for MAC user!,- SMALL size
electronics,8 of 18,5.0,Throttle Quadrant, I ordered this item and it has been all I expected it to be. The service is outstanding. I was told I would get it a certain day and giving a tracking number. I didn't really have time to keep up with where it was because it came 2 days ahead of time. 
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Speakerphone does not work,"I bought this phone brand new. Unless your mouth is within a foot of the mic, the other party will not be able to hear you while you are on speakerphone"
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Great batteries with great juice,I use these for my Canon S2 IS digicam. Lasted for over 200 snaps the first time used it. And that too with flash and all the other hullabu featurs of my cam. Definitely worth its price
electronics,,5.0,More about fake cards,"I recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through Amazon.  It did NOT have the notch at the bottom (as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake), so I phoned SanDisk and was informed, based on the serial number, that the card IS authentic.  So apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern"
electronics,,5.0,worthy buy,"I have the older version of the calculator and frankly, I was hoping to get the same. Yet, I am totally happy with the new design. The keys are firmer and you know when you've pressed them. The strange case of the old version, which used to wiggle a bit, is now replaced with a stylish design and a leather sleeve."
electronics,5 of 6,1.0,get a different one,"The reason I give it one star is a major design flaw:  the thing is physically too fat to fit into a lot of USB ports!  Look at it.  Whose idea was this?  Obviously if you buy something like this, you're gonna want to plug it in to a variety of yet-unseen computers."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,GPS 10 Broke shortly after arriving & tech support busy,I wanted a GPS to use on a road trip to Arizona and ordered a GPS 10 to use with a Dell Axim PDA. Got he GPS 10 at end of April and used a couple of times. It worked as advertised. On the road trip to Arizona I plugged it into the cigeratte lighter to charge the battery. The unit got so hot I could not hold it. After that the GPS 10 would not come back on. 
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Fantastic Performance,"I bought this router after fighting with an Airlink101 MIMO Wireless G router for many months. The Airlink router regularly dropped connections with my Mac Mini, and my kids' laptop and desktop PCs. It also could not be detected by the Xbox360 wireless adapter, which had no problem detecting a neighbor's Belkin router. I had to reset the Airlink router and reboot computers with daily regularity. I purchased this unit on sale, and I could not be more satisfied with the DI-634M router. The installation was easy. The unit has not dropped a connection since I installed it 3 days ago. All computers have enjoyed 100% internet connection reliability. I have great coverage throughout the 2 story house; better than the old router provided. I heartily recommend this router"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great value!,I've used this USB travel drive for several weeks now for business and personal use and have no complaints at all. I can very quickly back up my entire lap top (1.5 GB) and have room to spare. You don't have to live in a flood zone to benefit from this device. This is an amazing value
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Mapsource Deer hunting,Probably Mapsource deserves a higher rating but I have only used it Deer Hunting in Eastern Oregon so far.  It was easy to load and added a lot of detail even in a very rural area with only forest service roads.  The contours helped me to keep from falling into a ravine and being forced into a direction that I did not want to go.  I can't wait to load more of the map and some different areas.  I like the fact that you only have to load what you will be using.  It did not take as much memory as I expected it would.  I wouldn't use a GPS without it again. 
electronics,3 of 8,1.0,Altec Lansing im7  gets a thumbs up,"I was amazed at the big sound that came out of these small speakers.  It was a bit more than I wanted to spend, but I feel like it was well worth the money.  Amazon had it shipped and at my house in two days, too.  Nice"
electronics,,5.0,Nice product Nice service,I could easily found Amazon is the cheap seller of this product. Others will the same item for less online but they charge big amount of shipping and tax. The product is real good and working nice with my new Sony camcorder
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great For Dictation,I use this recorder to record my voice which I pipe through Dragon Speaking Naturally speech recognition software into a text document that I later use for word processing.  It works great.  It's almost as good as using the microphone connected to the computer.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Exceptional Quality at a Bargain Price,"Easy to use, especially for those with no technical expertise at all. The cost prints are a little high, but for printing the occasional quality print, this printer should meet most peoples' needs. Its portability lends it to taking it with you on a trip and allowing you to share your pictures on the run"
electronics,15 of 15,5.0,"EXCELLENT, reliable data storage--great for audio, too!","These CD-Rs are golden--both literally and figuratively! The quality of the sound I record onto them is a perfect copy of the sound from the source CD-R. Moreover, how can you beat a 300 year life expectancy? They'll survive longer than I will!"
electronics,2 of 5,1.0,RUN AWAY,"I got bamboozled into buying a Dish Network system over a year ago and to make a long story short, had viewable tv for about 4 months of the 12 that I had it, spent more time dealing with their customer service (or lack thereof) than I did watching my unit, have been fighting with their credit department who wants to charge me for 8 months of unwatchable service and the defective receiver(that I gladly offered to send back--they insist on charging me.)  Absolutely insane how messed up that company and it's system is.  Cut to the chase:  This one is where I should have been with from day one.  Don't make the same mistake!  God help us all if Echostar (Dish's parent Co.) is allowed to purchase Direct TV.  It will be back to cable for all of us"
electronics,8 of 13,2.0,Good As A Toy,I Once Got This Toy And The Strings broke the second day of having it. I think this is a toy.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,AWESOME,"This mouse is great, and simple. It's very smooth, a little sensitive but you will not regret it, and it's pretty cheap too"
electronics,,5.0,awesome,i have not had a problem with these speakers.  i bought them about 3 months ago. they are the best speakers i have ever bought. i play all genres of music through itunes and they work amazingly. the only downside is the length of wire. but i have worked around that to set them up in my office perefectly
electronics,2 of 4,2.0,Huge.,"The product information lists the measurements for this unit, but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much.  This MP3 player is huge.  One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket, well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size.  Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Garmin 2610,"I am thoroughly enjoying my my new GPS.  It is much faster to calculate and recalculate.  My purchase date entitled me to a free upgrade to City Navigator v8.0.  I got a 2Gb chip and loaded all of North America, so I am set to go anywhere!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Lots of TVs in house...this did it,"I have a large house with Comcast broadband and lots of TV outlets plus digital internet.  After I put a large screen TV in the basement with HD and all, the other TVs were further split and my reception sucked on all of the other basic cable outlets.  I purchased a few cheaper amps at RadioShack and stuff like that, hoping to save a buck.  None of them worked.  I plugged this in, it took 5 minutes and the increase in reception is like night and day."
electronics,5 of 7,5.0,"Well made, totally satisfied (and cheap too)","I have used sony, panasonic and JVC brand of mini-dv tapes and I can find no difference among these brands, maybe except the price."
electronics,10 of 17,1.0,Do NOT buy this product - warning from a battle-scarred victim,Do NOT under any circumstances buy this product unless you have another hard drive (preferably another brand such as Seagate) to mirror/back up this data to. If you use this as a solitary storage device for data you will be sorry. I am paying the price for my trust in what used to be a reputable brand.
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Great Book Holder,"I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,wouldn't change a thing,"In my experience with high-end aftermarket remotes I've owned a few. and in my experience the hard-buttoned remotes were always overly complicated to operate, and touch screens were fragile and gimmicky. One of the remotes I've owned was a philips pronto, [...] and I had for about a year, and it was pretty cool with a huge wow factor; but even a tech-saavy geek myself I found their editor software was slow, buggy, and unrefined."
electronics,14 of 24,2.0,Scan quality is a problem,"I agree the printer looks nice... nice size... easy installation... no problem scanning... until... I had to scan a newspaper article for a client.  At 200... I could not read the type... at 300... still could not read the type... at 600 still could not read the type.  Finally, I switched to my husband's Epson and got great quality on the first scan.  So.. I am now on my way to return the printer/scanner and order an Epson instead"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,nice for bedroom,I've owned this tv for almost a year and had no problems.colors are crystal clear.dvds look excellent.you have to keep the brightness level down though.nice for small rooms.easy to use remote.would recommend it
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Reasonably good, inexpensive radio","I am on my second one of these models. The first lasted several years and several hard shocks. At the price, when it gave out I felt that I had gotten my money's worth."
electronics,7 of 12,5.0,Great Product,Fast and easy delivery.  Very easy to use.  Overall I am very satisfied with this product
electronics,,5.0,Bluetooth Mouse,"This is a great BlueTooth Mouse.  It works very well with my Ipaq 2755.  I have the same companies keyboard which also works well, but the lay out of the keys is sometimes a pain in the @$$ because the function keys are required to be held down for numeric characters 1234567890 and shift numeric characters like !@#$%^&*().  The mouse is very well designed, very small, has a roll key that also works well.  NO MORE STYLUS!"
electronics,1 of 2,4.0,The amp's guts are worth $3000 - The remote $0,"This receiver makes my Paradigm Titans sound like $2000 speakers!  In order to benefit from the pure digital technology in this amp, you need to feed it digital, however.  "
electronics,3 of 5,5.0,Love It!,"Have used my Grundig Eton for a couple years and love it!  I don't need to run it on batteries, but love how it plays CD's, MP3's and is great for recorded books.  I do a lot of hand sewing and find it the perfect companion.  I like not having to wear a headset or earpiece to hear it, however, it has earpieces and a nice headset if you need them"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Highly recommend,"I read a lot of reviews on the MX5000 Desktop set before purchasing and thought there had to be something the people who had problems were doing wrong.  I installed it according to he Logitech instructions, downloading the lastest updates to Setpoint and have had not one problem with the keyboard or mouse. I did try it on another PC without using the Setpoint software and experienced some of the problems reported. So, if you're going to buy this and use it, install the software for it."
electronics,2 of 3,1.0,"Nice when it worked, but poorly made and unreliable","Nice gadget for the 1 year and 11 days that I had it, until it suddenly broke completely, for no apparent reason, and I had to buy a new player.  The warranty is 1 year!  $229 for a disposable MP3 player is a lot of dough."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,Excellent product,"I wanted a product that is affordable, nice looking and has an aux input! this Panasonic got it all. The price was amazing ($79.95) and it sound great in my wife's corolla. Amazon has the free shipping w/ this product, so it was even better. I would recommend this product to anyone who just want a nice cd/mp3 player in their car"
electronics,4 of 9,2.0,Not worth it's cost,"I admit,this is a nice &quot;looking&quot; power strip and it will work just fine with your electronics equipment,but you can get the same quality in a surge power strip for half the price of this one.With Monster Cable products,it seems that 50% of the product's price is in the way it &quot;looks&quot;,not what it actually &quot;does&quot;"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Sony 128 MB Memory Stick Media,Not much to tell it works perfect and Amazon got it to me on time in perfect shape!!  I would buy Sony and I always use Amazon.com
electronics,1 of 16,1.0,Bad Batch,"I am not sure who to be mad at 1st.Amazon or Verbatim? I don't know why I still use Amazon, since I have bad experieces with them. From never receiving product ordered,or this time from bad packaging. However, in this instance,Verbatim poor quality control of their product is the culprit. I lost many opportunity to record singular events (shows and movies that only will air once),because of defective discs. Not one or two,but try 15 percent on a spindle of 100. I Deam this error rate unacceptable. And no it was not my dvd player, since it was on several different players that I also used a disc lens cleaner and a disc cleaner on the discs themselves. I would as for a refund, but I not going to lose anymore money in sending them back. I am going to be leary to buy any future verbatim product,also,if I will ever use Amazon Again"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,"Easy setup, yet bumpy service","The router can be set up very easily, in fact it sets itself up. Worked really good for the first few days, but I've been having slow service as of late, (Becomes fast again when I reset the router)"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,For the price a good deal!!,"For an alarm clock/radio this is a great little unit.  So, the sound isnt so great--at $70 what do you expect.  The radio pulls in the stations I like (in the bay area) and the low light feature on the clock display is effective. Its easy to set the alarms and if you read the instructions its easy to set up and use.  My wife got one for her office and after I saw it operate I got one too.  We are both happy with our purchases"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,A nice passive AM antenna,"This antenna has good gain and since it is passive you don't have to worry about batteries or an AC adaptor.  The antenna must be tuned to the frequency of the radio.  This enhances selectivity, but can become annoying because when you change the frequency of the radio you must also retune the antenna.  My only complaint is that the antenna cannot be peaked above 1600kH, although the literature says it works to 1700kH"
electronics,11 of 11,5.0,A Budget LCD Monitor Done Right,"Bought as part of the dual monitor setup for my laptop. Luckily, not a single dead pixel. Impressed with picture quality and usability. Factory setting is a little too bright for me. In fact, I had to adjust the brightness down to 50%, as I prefer slightly dimmed working environment. It has one button (right most) to auto adjust phases, unlike many monitors that buries it under layers of menus. Although it has no DVI connection, the picture quality after the one click adjustment is very close to the 20"" Dells with DVI at work, better than them when using the VGA connector. This is a monitor you can stare for hours without fatigue. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Time-Saving Gadget,"Great product! Plug your computer into the top outlet of this device, and a multiple outlet strip into the bottom one. Then use that multiple outlet strip to power your printer, monitor, external hard drives, and anything else that you want to shut off when your computer does. (The instant you start-up your computer, power to your other devices is switched on immediately, as well.)"
electronics,0 of 1,4.0,Good quality for what you pay,"The earbuds supply very good sound for the price that I paid, which was about 40 bucks. I'm happy with the purchase, the only thing is, like the other reviews have said there is annoying rubbing sound that is heard when the wires rub on your clothes or whatever. Overall they are good earbud"
electronics,,4.0,"Best 21"" Widescreen Monitor if:","You need multiple monitor inputs for a PC and a video game console.  I bought this monitor for my son's college dorm room and it's great.  The monitor is connected to his Media Center laptop and an XBOX.  Games look AWESOME in HD.  Very capable multimedia monitor.  He uses it as his primary PC display, his TV (through the Media Center PC), and to play games. "
electronics,,4.0,Does the job,"I have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap, bought the Chill Pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down. It would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great sound - amazing price. ,to date these have been the best headphones i have ever owned. great bass presence and you get all the high end distinctions from studio headphones one would expect. the quality of these compared to the price is enormous. i would recommend hightly. 
electronics,,5.0,Great sound for a little case!,"Just a nice all around case. It may not hold two much but the sound is good for a small speaker, plus you can fit a few extras in it."
electronics,7 of 8,4.0,Does what it says on the tin...,"I have a 60gb iPod and the product fits fine. Like other users have said it is a snug fit, so make sure that, if you are still to register your player and set up itunes, you have taken a note down of your iPod serial number before fitting the jacket, so you don't need to try and get the thing off again."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Sound and looks,"For a relatively cheap center speaker, works great with quality sound and well built. Definitly would recommend it to anyone. Cheap price doesn't mean cheap product."
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Nice Product,"You can go wrong with Canon products. On top of that, the price is unbeatable"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,perfect stand for the Airport Express,"my second airport express unit is connected to my receiver and it always bothered me how it looked. Now with the sturdy Desktop Stand  it not only looks good, but the cables are neater and it does seem the reception is better too"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Worked well for me after downloading new firmware,"I first tried these blank DVDs and they did not work for me and I was very frustrated.  There was clear labeling on the package that new firmware was needed for many DVD writers to work with these discs.  However, my DVD writer was a variation of what was listed.  So I tried about 10 discs and only 1 worked.  Tonight I downloaded the firmware for a variation of my HP drive and all works fine."
electronics,32 of 51,1.0,you mean it doesn't even charge if yer connecting with usb??,"the only reason i shelled out the 37 beans for this thing is that i thought i could CHARGE and SYNC at the same time, and just leave the pod sitting in the cradle when i wasn't using it and it would stay charged. well, after a few days of sitting in the cradle i took it out, and was chagrined to see that the battery was low. wtf??  would it not take a charge? is my dock faulty? well i plugged it back into the separate a/c charger and its charging juts fine. which leads me to deduce that it does NOT charge for those of us losers connecting via usb. am i correct? (someone please check me on this.) what a ripoff. apple charges all this money for fancy packaging and design, and totally rips you off. ugh. SOR_REE for connecting with usb!!"
electronics,,5.0,Very nice,"I should say that I am not an expert in headphones, I have more experience in proper HiFi systems. Anyway, this is the best headphones I have ever tried with a very nice soundstage (didn't know it was possible with headphones!). I use them with iriver T10. Sometimes I'd like less basses, though. You can fold them, but I saw handier systems which are flat when folded. The look is quite particular and they could also be more confortable."
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,"Good Product, Great Price","The unusual shape of the keyboard takes a little time to get used to.  Once you've passed the initial adjustment, this product is excellent and at a great price.  A nice, basic keyboard"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,happy, The only thing i can think of that's wrong with this mouse is that it took me so long to buy it
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Can't beat it for the price,"I have had these speakers for about 2 months now and they sound good. Can't say amazing but for the price, I certainly can't complain. If you spend an moderate amount of time on games and mp3s, this will be more than enough to take care of ones average needs. This is my 4th set of logitech speakers and all but 1 set has been good to me. Can't go wrong with them."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent remote,"Easy to program, easy to use.  I programmed it to control my digital cable box, dvd player, vcr and tv without a hitch.  The TV is a 20 year old Magnavox and it works like a charm! Great device"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Excellent product,It does exactly what advertised. I used a PowerBook to edit video clips and the audio output is not strong enough to drive my power speakers. Boostaroo Audio Amp give me just enough boost to drive my power speakers and my audio meter. Great product
electronics,,4.0,recommended!,"Lots of good things about this. Sound is excellent, it's easy to use, and seems fairly durable. A way to adjust the pressure against your ears would be an improvement, as the headphones get fatiguing after an hour or so. But for the money, it's great"
electronics,,5.0,great product.,I've had no problems at all with this product. I don't get kicked off every 5 minutes like I did with my d-link wireless adapter. Also - it's easy to install and practially idiot proof. I was also very impressed with the shipping. I got it within a day or two. 
electronics,,5.0,A Solution That Works,"I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) "
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,Still worth it,"I'm a (very) amateur artist.  I have a web comic over at comicgenesis (Hey Fox) and I have been using this tablet to ink.  I was surprised how easily I transitioned from traditional materials to the electronic medium, and found the selection of pen nubs to be extremely helpful in getting exactly the right feel from the pen.  The buttons and customizable touch pad are really handy (I keep mine with a ""step back"" function, open apple, shift and space bar).  Oh right, and I'm using a Mac.  Just in case your curious the initial install was immediate (plug and play) though the software added a whole other layer of function!  "
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Awesome Phone for Customer Service Work,"I purchased this phone for my customer service job at home.  It is so convenient.  It gives you the option for an over-the-head or over-the-ear headset, either left or right ear.  The headset is noise filtering which make for very clear calls.  The earpiece has a leather ear cushion with the optional foam cushion which is also included.  The calls are very clear and have little or no static whatsoever.  On the side of the phone unit, you have a volume and tone control to make your calls even clearer.  This phone also has a headset rest, which keeps the headset up off the desk, therefore, cutting down on the clutter.  I couldn't be happier with this phone.  I would definitely recommend this phone for heavy usage as well as customer service work"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Still Working for me.,My ACP-EP 4GB Secure Digital Card is working great in my Cannon digital camera.  Love all the pictures and video I can take..
electronics,22 of 34,1.0,Way too expensive,This is nothing more than a VGA cable with different plugs. It is a rip off. Gold plated connectors or not. Use your compenent connections for near same quality image for one tenth the cost
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Cleans Great; DVD Repairs Need more,"I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are.  However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks.  [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.]  I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it.  If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away."
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,Great Experience Buying Sharp Aquos on Amazon,"I did a lot of research before settling on the Sharp Aquos 37"" LC37D40U.  Between price, quality, personal recommendations from owners and online reviews this seemed like the best set for my needs.  "
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Intelligent Review,"I banned Logitech and have since looked into Microsoft products. When I needed a new mouse I found this. The reviews here and elsewhere suggested a risk in buying it...there seem to be common problems with the mouse.  However, having used plenty of mouses (yes, mouses) I figured the majority of glitches are caused by the software. So, I took a chance and got the mouse but DIDN'T install anything from the CD...Just plugged it in and go go go.  It's been just fine.  Other than the commonly referenced problems, I don't like the side buttons.  The one that would make you move Forward on a web browser is too far away for my thumb :(  Might just be me...  I also don't like the wheel with it's side-scrolling action.  I find it difficult to use the wheel-button (Mouse Button #3).  So, because of these minor things that I've had to adjust to I give the mouse a 4.  Works JUST fine without drivers"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Essential Equipment for MyFi Handheld,"I bought this directly from the manufacturer as soon as it came out (and paid more than the Amazon price), but it is definitely worth the money.  I can only get XM reception in one room of my home with the XM antenna precariously positioned on top of a curtain rod.  It was very frustrating to have to deal with that (I almost sent it back and cancelled service), but this repeater takes care of the problem!  I can now use the MyFi as it was intended to be used--as a portable device--in every room of my home.  The only drawback is that the device is a little unwieldy at times because you have to keep the MyFi in its dock when you bring it to another room and you have the repeater antenna attached to that dock.  It can be a little awkward lugging all that hardware around.  If you are going to simply place it on a table in another room to listen, that is fine, but if you want to hold it in your hands, i.e., on your deck or patio, it can be awkward to have all that equipment attached to it.  Another minor drawback is that the device can get very hot (the repeater itself, not the antenna) and also it doesn't appear to have an on/off switch, so it's ""on"" all the time.  I don't know how many watts it draws, but that might be a problem for some people.  Other than that, it is absolutely wonderful if you have a problem getting an XM signal in your home. "
electronics,,5.0,Amazing TV. And Just the right size,Well ill have to keep this review short as its getting late.
electronics,,5.0,Great Value,"A place like CompUSA would get $20.00 for one of these, instead you get five cables at a great price.  Color coding is nice too for my sons LAN partie"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Nice Cans indeed,"I've had these for years now and am impressed that they've held up so well considering some of the extra stress I've put them through. Very comfortable to wear, excellent sound. Listening with any other headphones now is frustrating when all you can hear is what's wrong them or what's missing.  Within the first couple of months I did have trouble with the cabling as the connections would not stay flush with the cans, but the replacement cable has never had the same issue. I think they still do well without an amplifier, but clearly expose the quality of whatever they're plugged into."
electronics,10 of 12,5.0,The horse,"I was not as interested in the security requirements, but rather the capacity to haul large files between computers."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,ipod head phones,"Wonderful sound! Better than ipod's original ear buds. Fold up easily to store in case or not.Lightweight.  Would recommend to anyone interesting in ""real"" headphones"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Plantronics DSP-500,"The Plantronics DSP-500 headset is an excellent pair for the price. Used mostly in online games, mic and sound qualities are very good. I recommend this set especially for online gaming and listening to music"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Ran out of pockets,"17"" laptop fit snug, went on vacation, took my laptop, 2 digital cameras, wires, etc., but ran out of inside pockets for the extra batteries, wireless mouse, etc. All in all, it is a good product"
electronics,1 of 3,2.0,Actually it is not a noise-canceling mircophone.,"This product works good with Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, Skype, etc., But it is not a noise canceling phone"
electronics,1 of 3,2.0,I watch and listen to movies how about you.,I judge the picture quality to be worthy of five (5) bright stars.
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,"Easy to use, lightweight","This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what ""hold"" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use"
electronics,,5.0,These Jewel Cases are fine,These clear jewel cases make it easy to see what you have and the slim design saves space.  I use them for cd's and dvd's.  I haven't had any problems with them; they are a good value
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,A manual duplex mess!,"I upgraded from the 1440. To be honest, I'll probably go back to the 1440! Although the 2040 is faster, it is a mess in manual duplex mode, which I use often. It wrinkles the paper, gets the pages out of order, and pulls two pages through at once. I've emailed Brother to complain. This is truly a disappointment in a Brother product"
electronics,21 of 22,5.0,An Incredible Value to Help Achieve a Paperless Office,"I have to say that I am incredibly impressed by the ScanSnap S500. It provides excellent quality scans that are lighting fast. The settings are pretty easy to customize and most things occur automatically when the scan takes place. It automatically scans to PDF Document format and with a little extra processing time, will run the scan through the supplied OCR(Optical Character Recognition) software to create a PDF that is fully searchable. The scanner scans both sides of a page simultaneously within the same amount of time it takes to scan just the front. So if you are scanning at Normal quality (very adequate for most situations), and have double sided originals, you will achieve roughly 36 pages per minute. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,My URC100 died...this was actually on sale cheaper.,"This is so much better in my opinion than the URC100 which I also liked.  I really hated having to upgrade it, but it fell off the counter onto a tile floor and the backlight and joystick stopped working.  Universal Remote could fix it for $30 even out of warranty."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Excellent printer,"Ever since I saw this printer in my insurance company office, I knew it was the one I would purchase. Clear, fast, sharp printing. The styling also stood out. I have not been disappointed"
electronics,,5.0,DSL Router,Works right out of the box - if you have a problem they give you an 800 number to call. I am satisfied with it
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,love being wireless,I purchased this item because my parents just recently got DSL highspeed.  I thought that i would use it while i'm away at college to help get my moneys worth out of it.  I followed the instructions to a T and got the wireless card working.  Keep in mind that I'm not a computer wiz kid.  I did have one problem getting onto my schools network.  The colleges network is really wierd.  My card recognized that i was on the network but for some reason i couldn't get online.  I ended up having to call RCC (Residental Computing Connection) here on campus to help me get online.  After he worked with my computer for maybe 10 minutes i was online and surfing the net with very little noticable speed difference
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!,Do not buy this product unless you can afford to spend $50 a week on batteries
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great for air travel!!!,"I am a frequent air traveler and work on a ship.  These drown out the noise of those noisy planes, crying babies, and those old laidies who just never seem to stop talking.  Those who fly know what I am talking about."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Product is great, but I don't recommend buying these from Amazon","It's kind of a joke that Amazon ships these (which can easily fit in a 9x12 envelope) in a box that's about 9x12x5, and then charges $5.58 (62% of the price of the item) for the priviledge of receiving it 3-5 days later. "
electronics,,5.0,Great Sound,"The Altec Lansing Docking System is great ! The sound is very good and it's not to big , so you can put it almost any place. I am very happy with my purchase.. and you can't beat the price "
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Perfect for mac to pc transfers,"i bought this item looking to transfer files from my mac to pc since using disks just wasnt really an option anymore.  it works awesome in both usb 2.0 and the lower usb ports, is small, and flips right on my key chain when i'm on the go.  its been absolutely great and definitely recommend for the price"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,great batteries for the price,These batteries are a great value for the price.  I have already used one 24 pack and they work great and last as long as other AA brand batteries.  No brainer at this price. 
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,the best ink cartridges,I can always depend on Amazon.com to thave the best ink cartridges for my printer. The prices are always lower than anywhere else. The service is always outstanding
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Difference among xD formats,"This Sandisk SDXD-512 xD card is a ""standard"" xD card.  The xD ""Picture Card"" flash card comes in three flavors: standard (up to 512MB), Type M (512MB, 1GB, 2GB), and Type H (512MB or 1GB).  The ""H"" stands for ""high speed"" and is the latest format allowing in theory for reads and writes up to 3 times as fast as Type M cards.  Interestingly, Type M xD cards are 20% slower than ""standard"" 256MB or 512MB xD cards.  For capacity 512MB or above, you won't find any more standard xD's; you'll find only M or H ones."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Best Price for the Best Product,"I have studied every kind of player under the sun for months before I found this and the price is what got me. After reading some of the previous reviews I was really worried about freezing and not being able to get anyone to help me when it wasn't working but I bought it anyway and boy am I glad that I did. I have owned this item for about 4 months and I love it! There are so many cool things to do with it like record music to loading pictures. Freezing? no way! I have dropped this thing cleaning around the house so many times but that thing just keeps going! And cheap looking? Whatever! I get so many compliments! and the slick case makes it easier to keep safe and clean. It might be a bit heavy if your coming off a nano but it about the same weight as a deck of cards. And service! I was so clueless about loading playlist and organizing my music and pictures and the website was so helpful! I can even make a page just for my iriver so its super easy to keep up on my updates. I wouldn't buy anything else and at the rate I'm going, I might never have to."
electronics,,4.0,Nifty FM Transmitter,"Looking for an inexpensive way to get sound from your PC to your stereo system without wires? Try this gadget! It plugs into your output of your PC (or if you have an additional headphone output) and transmits the signal via FM that can be picked up by your stereo system. There is software you install, allowing you to change what frequency it transmits. Advantages: it's fast and easy. Disadvantages: it becomes another sound driver for your PC. This may not be a problem for some folks, though. The signal strength really depends on how many walls it must go through before your FM radio picks it up. Experimentation is the key"
electronics,,4.0,"Sleek, eyecatching",Shape of the mouse seems just right and the keyboard is pretty sturdy for being so thin.  The only complaint I have is that the keyboard has no caps lock or num lock LED.  You could key in a really long key code or passward and have it fail because the caps lock is on and you don't know it!  How much extra could this feature have cost
electronics,5 of 6,5.0,Elcellent For Scanning Old Slides,Wonderful for scanning old slides. The color and clarity is great. I'm so glad I bought this scanner
electronics,,5.0,Perfect cordless keyboard & mouse,it works perfectly without any troubles. this keyboard has lot of features for multimedia and other system functions. i strongly recommend to buy this product
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,The MITO wins over all others,"July 2006.  After testing the Jwin, Griffen 30BK, Edge DiskGO, and the Kensington Pico, and the MITO, the MITO wins hands down.  The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close.  My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation.  In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep.  Go with the MITO, you won't be sorry"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great product,"It is a must have for any serious Flight Simulator player.  The device is easy to install and work as stated.  Makes a big difference in terms of realism experience.  When combined with the Yoke, makes a real difference.  A little pricey, but if you have the money, you will not regret.  Just get it!"
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Good MP3 Player for around $100,"Not ready to invest a lot of cash into an MP3 player yet, so I wanted something expandable and cheap. I am pretty happy with my purchase of the RD2315 Lyra. This one has 512megs embedded memory and is expandable via an SD Card slot (up to another 512 megs for 1 gig total)."
electronics,6 of 6,2.0,Ear Plugs with a speaker in them,My much anticipated new Super.fi 3 headphones arrived today.
electronics,,5.0,As Promised,"This product is everything it promises. I had investigated other options before buying, but you never know until you open the package and use the product. Good value item"
electronics,,1.0,Works fine for a year then dies without warning,"I've had this router for a little over a year and it's worked perfectly during that time. However, recently the internet (WAN) port seems to have stopped working, and I can no longer access the internet either through wireless or through a wired connection. The WAN indicator light is on and blinking, and the PC light on my cable modem is also on, showing that they recognize each other, but there is no internet traffic going through. I tried resetting the router, reverting back to factory settings, and upgrading the firmware, but no luck. I had to finally resort to hooking up my cable modem directly to my computer to use the internet. I haven't tried contacting tech support, but after calling them a couple years ago for another Dlink router I had and spending close to two hours on the phone with them, I'll pass. Time to toss this piece of junk in the trash."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"Not as Stylish as an iPod, but More Useful",I originally bought my Zen player thinking it was a cheaper alternative to the iPod.  I was so very wrong.
electronics,2 of 3,4.0,Garmin Bicycle Mount Bracket for eTrex and Summit,The bracket and back cover are OK. The lock mechanism - metal T-shaped pin locked into Garmin's plastic body does not look solid for agressive mountain riding. I'm afraid it will break up after awhile.
electronics,11 of 13,5.0,"Works with DVD Recorders, too!","I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended"
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,The Time Stamp problem can be fixed!,"I had the same problem as one of the other reviewers.  The WRTSL54GS could not connect to an NTP server and get a current time, so all of my files on the USB drive would come up with a date of 1969.  "
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Lots of Bugs!  Topic Entertain publishes this CD,"The company Topic does a lousy job at customer service.  As for the developer, maybe some third rate company.  The scans of the maps are not high enough for area blow ups.  Everything is fuzzy at best.  The interface is clumsy ... sluggish ... backwards!  This is the 21st Cen!  If you have a Garmin, stick with their apps for now.  Or just buy an old fashion topo map."
electronics,40 of 45,5.0,DVD got better,"I have a Sony 36&quot; Vega and a Sony DVD player that were hooked up with RCA cables.  I got a nature DVD and it was pretty good with the RCA cables.  I purchased the component cables and the picture got even better, it was AMAZING.  I was slow to purchase the component cable but have not regreted  getting them, you can really tell the difference.  They are worth the  price"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,A  high quality speaker system for a budget price.,"I wanted a good media-type PC because I have an extensive record and CD collection, I purchased a Sony VAIO. But the speakers provided with it were tinny sounding and just plain awful. Being on a limited budget, I bought the JBL Creature II speakers and was amazed at the quality of tone they provide. Rich, deep bass sounds that literally vibrate my desk and high notes of unbelievable purity and clarity. Bass and treble tone controls make it easy to find the right sound for an individual. "
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Save your money peeps,This item is flawed to hell.
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,Didn't last,I owned four different sets of NiMH AAs; this was the latest purchase and the first one to stop working.  I do have decent chargers and never dropped them or anything.  It actually ruined my day twice.  Very disappointed
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Life is so uncluttered and simple now,I just bought this remote and I can't get over how simple life is now.  Let me get rid of all those remotes hanging around.  With a touch of a button I can have my 360 on and running perfectly.  The same with all my other units.  I couldn't get over how simple the program makes this remote to set up.  Well worth the price
electronics,8 of 8,2.0,Poor quality control,"The machine works great when it works. Unfortunately, I have had two models that needed repair - sigh. The first time the print head died. The second time the cutter was defective. Brother needs to a better job on their quality control. Also, I agree with others about too much wasted tape - a real scam since you need their expensive tapes"
electronics,,5.0,Does its job very well,"No complaints at all. for its price, this is must have if you play games or listen to music at nights. with just one click, you can toggle between speaker and headset. No more unplugging and plugging headsets"
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,"Fantastic, but Expensive","I purchased these earphones for listening to music on an iPod and--because of the sound isolation--for monitoring video recordings for my job. I generally rip music at 192Kbit, if that reference is important to you."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,AT&T E5965C 5.8 GHZ Cordless Phone is Best on Market,"I've owned Uniden (great technical support), Panasonic and other brands of cordless phones. The AT&T E5965C is the BEST cordless I've owned since my old AT&T cordless from 1991. Quality, quality, quality. Absolutely no interference with my wireless network, great sound quality and volume control. Also, AT&T is the only brand I could find that has DSS technology for more security. Uniden no longer makes 5.8 GHz phones with DSS. I need the 5.8 GHZ because of my wireless network, and I want the DSS for privacy. Each handset has volume control (a necessity for us older folks), and I can retrieve messages from any handset. Also, each handset has intercom. This is a great feature if you fall down and can't get up, etc. You can page anyone in the house for help."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,As Expected,"My second Simple Tech drive purchased. They've both worked right out of the box as expected. Shouldn't be impressive, but these days, it's refreshing"
electronics,8 of 9,2.0,phone,"1-on a desk, the craddle doesn't hold the receiver that well "
electronics,15 of 59,1.0,Moving on to Bigger and Better,"I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant ""let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel"" navigation ""aid"" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,not worth the money,"I read lots of steller reviews about this product about how the ipod is so protected inside etc. Well, this product is extremely heavy and made in ipod twice its size, and the belt clip kept breaking. what would happen is I'd be wearing my ipod on the belt clip and then there would go my ipod in the case on the floor while the belt clip was still attached to my pants. I guess, rhinoskin's protection did help my ipod with stand a few falls, but with a better case it wouldn't be an issue. I returned this product right afterwards"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Nice Case,This's a great case. It keeps together and is very durable. It's perfect for all those CDs and some DVD
electronics,11 of 15,1.0,You will not receive what you ordered!,"If you order this item, you will receive the lower-capacity Q5949A. I ordered it through Tiger Direct and, while they allowed me to return it, they made me pay for shipping"
electronics,,5.0,Works very well.,We bought this to play music in the nursery when our twins were born 6 months ago. 
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,"bad mouse, good instant customer service",also had a problem with left clicker   thanks to the reviewer here i called microsoft and they shipped a replacement Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 with no charge or having to return the mouse.
electronics,21 of 25,1.0,paper shredder,"This is a very weak product. It jammes easily, I would not reccommend it"
electronics,,4.0,Works Well !," This transmitter is a little more complicated to hook up compared to those that just nest on the top of an iPod (see my review of the Airplay unit), but has greater range, and sounds good."
electronics,286 of 286,1.0,N.E.W sucks big time!,"Okay,"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,Very Slow ,"This device is good except that it is very slow... the data transfer rate is really poor, 2 GB are transfered in about 30 minutes what is really bad"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,This paper is too thin,I used it on my Epson Photo 960 using the &quot;Glossy Photo Paper&quot; option as the paper type (this could have had something to do with it).  The photos were very wrinkled up due to the thinness of the paper.  Better to go with Premium Glossy paper or Premium Semi-gloss.  Theres a big difference
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,Poor performance,"When it works the picture is tremendous. I can't comment on the sound since I use a home theater receiver for that. It has some nice features, and settings."
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,You'll be lucky to get a year out of this machine,"Well after a year of transfering lots of home video VHS onto the hard drive of this machine, the hard drive has crashed and all of my video files and about 100 hours iof work are gone. The only thing Humax will do is offer a replacement machine that is refurbished for a fee.. This unit is total crap. DO NOT BU"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,great sound,"I got these headphones for recording music but I have found myself useing them for many other things, because of the great sound quality. Also they are very light weight, and very comfortable"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,affordable and good for office use,"i have used the S12 for a while and i am very pleased with it. the sound quality is excellent and the earpiece is comfortable. there is a way to set it up so you don't have to remove the handset from the phone every time, but i could not control the volume that way. if you need a headset but don't need to walk around the office with it, this is the way to go"
electronics,17 of 19,4.0,Great buy,"So far, I am satisfied."
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Too bad you have to have a Linksys router for this POS to work..,"...if I had known that, wouldn't have bought it"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great Little Firewall,I use it as a cheap and easy firewall.  I've had no probelms whatsoever.  Setup was simple--great instructions and installation disk
electronics,11 of 16,1.0,not recommended,the design is clever.. but really doesn't work well... you must extend both the headphones AND the audio jack at the SAME TIME or else the cords get tangled up(the instructions on the box state this).. but that's a pain. 
electronics,23 of 23,5.0,"Great noise cancellation, very comfortable","Ironically, while most people buy a version 2 before they buy a version 3, I bought the Bose QuietComfort 2 *after* I had purchased the Bose QuietComfort 3 newer headphone set."
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Very Dispointed! Wish I had returned rather than changed,"I bought this DVD on Aug. 14. When it arrived, I found that I cannot plug the power line into the AC Adapter. I called Amazon. The reps were very nice. But I made a mistake! I should have RETURNED it rather than replaced it!"
electronics,4 of 4,2.0,"Ok for the price, but not very good over all.","The quality of some the tools is poor, in particular the electronics vacuum and the soldering iron.  The vacuum is completely ineffective, and the soldering iron does not get hot enough to wick solder.  The flash-light is shoddy."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Fairly Good Quality,"Sure, it's over-priced, but so are most of Apple's toys.  This nifty little device fits snugly into the bottom of your iPod and transmits to most non-music stations on your car radio, boat radio or home radio.  There can be some static, so it takes a bit of moving around to find the perfect reception.  Mine works fine in the glove compartment of my car or sitting on top of my home receiver.  It sure beats having an adapter to deal with and you can carry it out of your car for safe keeping"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,Fuji Rules,"Great card, crisp clear shots.  Fuji continues to provide the best in pic. cards."
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Tons of Pictures,I have never run out of space on this disc. It's a wonderful thing to know you are not gonna run out of disc space during a creditcal time
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Sony DVPNS55P/S Single Disc DVD Player,"Sony has made a quality DVD player. No problems at all with the machine.  It plays everything I have, MP3 DVDs to foreign discs without a hitch. It also plays discs my other players could not even read due to read errors. Memory function is truly a blessing even if the player has been shut off with the disc still loaded. A solid investment most definitely"
electronics,18 of 18,5.0,Must have for the serious flightsimmer,This review will talk about both the CH Rudder Pedals and the CH Flight Yoke USB.
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Zen Micro is the worst piece of junk I've owned!!,WARNING!!!!!Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!!!!It's hard to believe Creative had the nerve to release this buggy piece of garbage. 
electronics,1 of 4,1.0,bad bad cable,"This is a case of getting just what you pay for. I bought this cable to hook up a brand new printer. Not only did the cable not work, but it blew out my USB PCI card. This $4.55 cable wound up costing me a fortune"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Best remote out there for the money,"I bought this product in Oct 2006.  I downloaded the latest version of the software from Logitech's web site.  This is the best remote I've ever had.  I replaced a Pronto 1000 (which was also a great remote).  I was able to program my 6 different components very easily.  The logitech database didn't have the discrete codes for the inputs to my television, but I was able to have the remote learn them easily.  While it took me a week to get the Pronto working the way I liked.  It only took an hour to get this remote completely working.  The only annoyance is that you have to reprogram the base and the remote whenever you make a change to the program.  In my setup that's not that easy to do.  They could have made it easier if the power supply was detactable, but they didn't.  So when I reprogram the remote I have to dig in the back of the television to unplug the base unit.  But it's worth it.  I had no problems with software"
electronics,,1.0,expensive coasters,"I too bought these after not finding spindles of the Verbatim DL. A few work, but only a very few. I have an NEC recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these. The machine is a dual Xeon with 2GB of RAM, so this is not a resource issue. Sigh"
electronics,1 of 5,2.0,Aweful Headphones!," These headphones are so expensive and they are aweful! I dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other; its very annoying! I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great sound from such a tiny device!,Pros:
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Worth the *big* bucks!,"Considering the Logitech website states that this product isn't available until Oct.31st, I don't know why people are ancy.  Mine came 3 weeks ahead of Amazon's estimate."
electronics,,4.0,The Powerjolt ,"I use my iPod nano in my car and was constantly running the battery down. Finding a charger to do this is easy, but I wanted to go with a trusted name like Griffin.  In summary, it does the job, the cord is long enough and it's white which matches my nano. Overall, a good value from a trusted name"
electronics,5 of 11,5.0,"Make sure you buy/get the 49X. Avoid the 49A, as it's too high priced*","I love my hp1320, but had a rude awakening with toner cartridges."
electronics,,5.0,A good webcam,"I have been using this webcam for almost a year now with YM, skype etc. I like this camera. The video quality is good and the camera is quite small and fits well on my laptop. It comes with a software which allows you to capture images at different resolutions and also capture videos. "
electronics,,5.0,nice tv,i had this tv for about 2 years now its great works fine 
electronics,47 of 48,5.0,A few VERY IMPORTANT points:,"Instead of gushing prosaic over how great these earphones are, I would instead like to point out a few important points."
electronics,,5.0,Practicle STORAGE,This case wouldn't get far if if I carried it around everyday but its perfect for organized storage. I got it for about s*x dollars. well worth it
electronics,,5.0,Awesome although its not the fatest,"If you are trying to get a good quality charger, then Sony BCG-34HRMF4 is made for you. "
electronics,54 of 56,5.0,Great for Runners!,"I like to run so I bought this for my ipod.  It fits the ipod and my arm very well, the strap is elastic and adjustable and closes by velcro. It comes with two different size holders.  I have the 30Gig 5g ipod and it fits that great.  I think the other holder is for the ipod nano. I really like that my ipod dosn't bounce around while I'm running, it stays put against my arm"
electronics,11 of 12,5.0,Love It !!!,"I purchased the Phillips PET 824 last weekend in preparation for a trip to Hawaii and a 9 hour plane ride, and love it.  I've never purchased a Philips product before and wasn't sure what to expect but I'm very happy now!  I'm visually oriented and the picture is very nice, but what really surprised me was the quality of the sound available through the special noise-reduction earphones.  You can practically 'feel' the really deep rumbling sounds from movies like 'War of the World.'  The battery life also shocked and pleased me.  I wanted to see if it would actually last the 6 hours advertised, so I watched one movie, put in another movie and fell asleep for 4-5 hours.  When I woke, I put in another movie and didn't loose a beat. Although the player generates some heat when played for several hours, it's no problem.  I'm now searching for an additional rechargeable battery as I plan to keep and enjoy the unit for some time to come"
electronics,50 of 56,5.0,"Excellent, but pricey.","The receiver has a large touchscreen and is by far the easiest to operate and see while driving.  I justified the price tag because I do need this for finding customers - I commute 60 miles one-way to work daily and don't know the city well.  I go mobile to see five clients per week on average.  I used to use MapQuest to print-out driving directions, but I don't feel safe navigating from a paper print-out while driving."
electronics,9 of 10,5.0,Can't beat it.  Nothing else is even close.,"Have had i-WAY 350C for 2.5 months.  Has performed well since first plugging it in.  Initial Sat lock 2 minutes or so.  So much configurability, and amazing details available for map screens. Base maps are pre-loaded for US, Canada. Show as many or as few as you need. Address Book holds 1,000 contacts.  Load in your via's (Way Points) and autosort, to get best route to make the stops you need.  Several free skins available from Lowrance web site, to change the look, if you want. Did experience a very few software inconveniences at first.  Not really a problem since the configurability allows ""Work Arounds"" if needed.  "
electronics,23 of 24,1.0,Your money is better spent elsewhere,"Like most have pointed out, it's a digital signal and there's no need for all the gas-injected, gold plated, shielded stuff monster cables hype.  For analog signals this stuff absolutely makes a difference because analog cables are highly affected by outside EM interference."
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,AWESOME!!!,"I was hesitant to try this one based on the review.  However, I did and I find it absolutely awesome.  I traveled this summer with with my 12 Megapixel Camera and my ipod loading the days shots each night to the ipod.  I found the transfer rate acceptable considering the large picture sizes and experienced NONE of the battery life problems mentioned by others.  I must point out, however, that my ipod was fully charged each time I loaded the photos.  I found it an excellent tool and a convenient way to share photos on the road.  Next to the ipod itself, this is my favorite gadget!  ...oh yeah, it worked with my digital video camera too!!"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"WOW!  Solid construction, almost overkill.","I mainly bought this for its reliability, # of outlets and (most of all) the CleanPower feature.  Funky / dirty AC power is one of the leading causes of shortened life expectancy for electronics.  Some things I noticed:"
electronics,,4.0,Nice Product,Many pieces for the price that come in handy when working on computers. I love it
electronics,2 of 4,2.0,7/23rds coasters,"7 out of 23 of these discs turned into coasters, at 8x speed with my Powerbook G4.  (The other two discs had data corruption.)  That's unacceptable, and I'll never buy Verbatim again"

electronics,8 of 10,4.0,Nice cordless mouse,My computer mouse decided to die on me so I went straight out and found this one in one of the local shops.  It looked rather more comfortable than most of the other optical mice on the shop's shelves and the blurb on the box gave a longer battery life than others on sale.  It was also a relatively inexpensive model compared to some of the others.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,I like the foam earphone slips!,"After trying all the different kinds of earphone tips that came with my E3c earhones, I found that the foam covers work best. Besides, they're just like the earplugs I used to wear when traveling on little turboprop planes from Reno to Salt Lake to visit my kids! They really do block the outside world and allow the music to come through, unabated."
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Great, I was shopping for a portable speaker for my iPod and stummpled over this
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Easy to setup, works great with MacOS X 10.4.8","Like most everyone else in these forums, I'm fairly happy with my SlingBox. Very easy to set-up, although two things annoy me. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Oh the things you can buy for your iPod,"After I bought my iPod a charger, a tape adapter, an FM broadcaster, a case, a  running wheel, and a water bottle, I decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car.  These little Belkin numbers are quite nifty.  They hold the iPod in a nice position in my cupholder such that I can glance down at it instead of picking it up when I need to review the playlists/switch songs.  Overall a nifty product - now even better that it's a little cheaper."
electronics,40 of 43,2.0,Kingston = SLOW,"This Kingston card uses a multi-level-cell (MLC) Flash made by Toshiba and writes much slower than the single-level-cell (SLC) models. I would avoid Kingston if you have a high resolution digital camera or frequently use the burst mode on your camera to take several pictures back to back. For MP3 players or lower resolution cameras, this card may be fine. Just keep in mind that it will also take longer to write MP3s from your computer to this card than it will with others. I would opt for a card made by SimpleTech, which is in the same price category but much faster"
electronics,6 of 6,4.0,Great player - It's nearly perfect,"First off, the sound quality on this player is far above par (the main reason why I chose iAudio). I had a Sansa E270 for about 2 weeks and couldn't stand the bad sound quality and unintuitive navigation system."
electronics,3 of 9,5.0,Order disappeared without notification,"I'm sure the product is great, I'm very happy with two 2GB I have and so I gave this 5 stars."
electronics,0 of 2,1.0,not a happy shopper,"i recently purchased the above item and in turn received another remote in its place after the seller emailed me back to say this is not the item anymore, but i am now out of $16 for an item i don't want, so this is not the item you're purchasing"
electronics,2 of 7,4.0,Panasonic KX-TG5776S 5.8GHZ Phone,I was basically very satisfied with this product with the exception of the volume level. At the highest volume it is still fairly difficult to hear the other party. If I had known this I probably would not have bought this phone as this is fairly important to the function of the phone
electronics,8 of 8,5.0,"Burn, baby burn!","These discs are fantastic.  I just purchased a 16X DL burner and I've had such great luck with the standard Verbatim+R, I went for the DL disks. "
electronics,4 of 7,4.0,Great Value!,I bought this telephone for the church of which I am the treasurer.  We needed a new 2 line phone for our pastor's office so I checked here at Amazon.com and found this model.  It is perfect.  Not fancy and easy to use. 
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Motorola Radios Great for Conference Setting,"At a age where cell phones abound, we found ourselves staging a conference where there is no cell service and the conference center is sprawling (two square miles).  These radios were the answer to communucation problems that the staff encountered.  We used thirty radios to keep connected in two teams and even found it easy to communicate with the other team easily when needed.  The only disadvantage is that they recharge in pairs.  We solved this by recharging all of them in two central locations, and the team members picked them up each morning.  They provided great clear transmission and communication between staff was a breeze"
electronics,,5.0,awesome,"awesome apple keyboard, it came brand new and got here pretty quickly. thanks amazon"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,I Wish There Were More Stars to Give to This Keyboard,"Consider this review 5 stars squared. My husband calls me the Queen of Input Devices. As auspicious as this sounds, it's true. I have test-driven so many keyboards that I've lost count, and this one is by far THE BEST. I spend 8-10 hours a day on this keyboard and its response to typing at any pace is fantastic. It leaves me with little wrist strain, and paired with my Logitec Marble Mouse, my productivity has increased significantly. But it's not just about speed, it's about comfort. If you're one of those people who is particular about the kind of pen you write with, you're missing out if you haven't found the perfect keyboard. This is it. (Oh, and if you have a tendancy to type furiously, sometimes being a bit too intense with your keyboard, this one can take it.) I mainly use a Mac, but I have a PC for accounting, and have the PC version of this keyboard as well. ...So, what are you waiting for? BUY IT"
electronics,2 of 4,1.0,Altec Lansing ,"Altec Lansing has decent prices but the products are shoddily made. If they work, they're ok, but most likely they'll break in some small way the day after the warranty expires. If you can understand their support people- it helps if you've been to Mumbai-all they seem capable of doing is reading company policy to you. "
electronics,11 of 13,5.0,Excellent quality at a fair price,If you have a digital camcorder you'll need lots of tape.  The new camcorders are so easy to use and small enough to take anywhere that you must remember to carry extra tapes.  These tapes are also small enough to allow you to easily carry additional tapes.  TDK always makes a reliable product and these tapes are another good example of TDK quality.  I've used the same tape again and again with no obvious degradation of quality.  My video (with an inexpensive camcorder) is clear and crisp. The tapes that I use repeatedly are holding up fine. Overall I'm really pleased
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Best quality speakerphone for a home phone,Great rig. Easy to use. Super flexible with speakers in the handsets & base. Dial from the base is convenient too. Range is pretty good and clarity is excellent. Best set up for my home office in four years. 
electronics,18 of 24,5.0,It is easy with XP and performs beautifully,"I don't get the ""Microsoft Professional""; sounds more like an insider for them."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Great product!,"I bought this card for my Kodak Easy Share 3.1 mp camera.  Before I ordered it I was a little worried that it might not work, but I was very happy that when I received it, it worked right off without having to format it or anything.  I bought it specifically for a Duran Duran concert on July 18th in Orlando; I took 80+ pictures and did not have to wait long after each picture to take another one.  I then took the card to Walmart to have the pictures printed, and it worked fine there as well.  If you are looking for a reliable memory card to hold a lot of pictures, try this one"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,A great value,These speakers are terrific for the money.  Sound good and look good.  Highly recommended
electronics,2 of 9,1.0,I just paid $29.99 for 100 sparkly Frisbees from Amazon. This just don't make no motha^*(&^(* since,"At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place."
electronics,14 of 14,5.0,"So far, so good, great value","This is my first portable DVD player that I have purchased.  It has all the bells and whistles I need, including an 8"" widescreen format to enjoy mini theater like video while on the go.  I have seen other views fixated on ""do not use in a moving vehicle"", but I think that is meant to be ""don't watch while driving"", poorly translated to english.  This works fine while moving and in the backseat, and properly secured.  This Div-X certified, DTS, Dolby, THX,...ect, plays almost anything you throw at it.  It also has build in MMC/XD/SD/Memory stick slot built right into the front, so you can see a nice slide show of family photos prior to returning home. The battery is a bit bulky, but fits nice and flat to the back and bottom of the unit, and has a reasonable life (4 hours).  This comes iwth AV mini cable adapter, AC adapter, Car adapter, slim remote, and battery pack.   I do see a possible inconvenience of having to send this back to the vendor for work, but I recieved this as a gift, and that is fine by me.  An extended warranty was not available where purchased, so this was the option anyway.  Overall, picture quality is great, sound is adequate, but with 2 headphone jacks, there is no fighting to hear the sound.  This has video in and video out and optical audio out...so it can be hooked into a big tv/stereo system.  Finally, very light unit, 1.9 lbs without battery, very portable.  Worth checking out, I'm happy, and I think you will be too"
electronics,16 of 16,4.0,A couple of features short of perfect,This is a great system. I purchased this and three additional handsets to replace a broken fax machine and an older cordless phone system I had not quiet liked. The sound quality is very good. One of my favorite features is checking the voicemail right from any of the handsets.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Sweet keyboard,The keyboard was delayed in shipping but goes with my black and red computer awesomely. I really haven't fully used it in the dark for hours or anything but on the first night test it was very helpful to have it lit up for the minor work. I really wish I could make it even BRIGHTER because it looks SO COOL.
electronics,,5.0,"Great, does exactly what it says, great price!  ","The silicone is great quality, fits the nano snugly, and the arm band is nice.  Wonderful product, does what it's supposed to do, for a fabulous price. Recommended"
electronics,,4.0,Budget-priced speakers are a big hit!,Purchased 3 sets for relatives and all loved them.  The speakers are more than adequate for their dorm rooms and small functions with friends.
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,They're OK,"Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,"Great product, pays for itself!","I'm also a Geocacher, and I have to say this is a great product! I've been wasting money on rechargable batteries, but now I don't even have to worry about batteries at all. Good for long trips, too; because you don't even have to have batteries at all. A must-have for anyone owning a Meridian GPSr"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Extremely Pleased with little phone.,"I couldn't disagree more with the previous comment.  I purchased this phone from amazon and couldn't be happier.  The volume, tone and quality is wonderful.  The phone is logically laid out and very easy to use with its large oversized contoured buttons. If you have two lines and want a headset phone... this is the one for you"
electronics,,5.0,Love it,"I love the feel of the keyboard, the backlighting is just right, and it's worked exactly as I hoped it would.  I got it because I play a lot of video games and they are better in a dark room - now I can still read the keyboard and it's improved my gaming experience"
electronics,1 of 4,5.0,Cruzer Titanium 2 GB,This is an excellent product.  I can put store so much information on it for traveling

electronics,1 of 6,5.0,Great cable,What can you say? It works perfectly and is of high qulity
electronics,35 of 35,4.0,Simple to use and delivers great pictures,"Bought one of these for wifey's birthday since she wanted to have a simple way of making prints without using the computer based printers in our home. VERY simple to use; plug it in, turn it on, select language, insert card, select which image to print by scrolling forward or backward on the display, put in a sheet of paper and push the print button. Print quality results are very good - as good as my HP 7660 albeit slower to print. Would give it five stars if the screen resolution were better and the speed was a bit quicker. She likes it for it's simplicity, print quality and is really thrilled with it overall"
electronics,7 of 13,5.0,Home Theatre Enthusiast,"You shouldn't have any doubt in your mind about buying these superb video cables.  They provide the highest quality picture on your tv.  Since there are three cables instead of one, more information, can be sent to the tv with better detail.  These cables have served me very well, and they have really improved the picture quality of my DVD player"
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,If you want a PowerBook keyboard for your desktop then this is it,"I've used many keyboards from both Mac and PC computers and found my PowerBook's keyboard to be the most comfortable and enjoyable one to use. This SlimType keyboard feels very similar to my PowerBook. This is basically a laptop keyboard made for desktop compters. This means that is has the short actions of a laptop keyboard, which I find a lot better because it takes very little effort and finger movement to press each keys. This keeps my hands from becoming tired and painful after hours of typing. I've used ergonomic keyboards and I find that I don't need them with this keyboard. With a standard keyboard I get constant wrist pains but that all went away when using my Powerbook, so for those of you who also suffer from this problem this might be a good alternative to learning and using an ergonomic keyboard."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Works great on Win2000,The software included with the Trendnet adapter installed easily and appears to be very capable.  It took only seconds to pair my Win2000 PC with my Motorola e815.  I can use the software that came with the adapter to pull pictures off the phone.  It's easier than using Motorola's own software.  The software also allows for dial up networking with this phone.

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Essential tool for highway travel,"I don't need advance warning of law enforcement around town but my car (Porsche, Boxster S) doesn't like to travel at 50 or 65 for hours on end on the interstate.  We recently took a 17-day, 3k mile driving vacation from San Jose, CA to Whistler, BC and the RX65 paid for itself on the first day, the last day and probably more than once in between."
electronics,,5.0,Logitech Z-2300,"     These speakers are the best.  There is no distortion of sounds and no matter how loud you blast your music it will sound good.  This system has more power than most stock car systems so it is really loud, i recommend this to anyone who loves listening to their music loud or quit because these speakers are absolutly the greates"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works great with HP V40xi all-in-one.,"I had no trouble installing the print server, it was very easy. I was happy to see that it worked with my all-in-one whereas many print servers will not."
electronics,9 of 10,4.0,Does what it purports to do.,"Set up was straightforward, only glitch is that the instructions do not explicitly suggest that the set up needs to be done with a hard wired ethernet cable to your router."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,good radio,i've only had my homebase acouple of months and it the best one i've ever had and i've had a few over the years
electronics,3 of 3,2.0,Microphone gain too low,"I constantly get complaints that the person at the other end of the line can't hear me because the sound of my voice is so low.  Otherwise, it is a great headset.  Comfortable, good headphone, sunds clear and loud.  Just the micraphone seems to have trouble.  So I'm not using it"
electronics,3 of 4,4.0,Value for money,I bought this TV because I wanted a reasonably priced one as I'm only going to be in the States for two years. The picture quality is very good and the sound is pretty good as well. My only criticism would be a small one and that is the instructions are not very easy to read.
electronics,4 of 17,5.0,Solid Choice,I am very happy with my purchase.  A fantastic component with many useful features and great quality
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Printer if you Don't Need Color,My Mom kept complaining about her older HP inkjet printer. It was acting odd yet again. This was her second HP inkjet printer and she didn't use it that often - in fact it was still on its second ink cartridge. She was asking for a better option.
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,Speaker didn't work - had to return it,"I am another person who couldn't even set up the unit since the speaker didn't work when I opened the box.  It might be an okay unit, but since I received a defective one, I will never know.  I saw others had received defective units, but thought it wouldn't happen to me.  I took a chance and lost.  Seems like AT & T has a quality assurance problem if they are shipping lots of units with problems.  Steer clear.."
electronics,,5.0,Works as Advertised,"When I upgraded my motherboard and lost my RS-232 ports, I feared I would no longer be able to use some of my legacy devices. I didn't want to use up one of the precious few PCI slots on this motherboard for an adapter, so a USB solution appealed to me."
electronics,3 of 8,5.0,2nd generation done good,"okay, so its my birthday in three days, i always did want an ipod and my best friend didnt want me to get an ipod he was insisting that i should get a different kind of mp3 player, i did take his idea into consideration but i didnt like waht i saw or what i heard. so i went out and bought myself the ipod nano in blue...i like it sooo much you have no idea..its light yet durable, holds tons of songs, the blacklight is literally a mini flashlight, and yes...again its really light- you can carry it in your pocket and forgetits there i love my new ipod-its so simple and easy to us"

electronics,10 of 12,1.0,not good,i bought these speakers to use for my computer.  the sound is terrible. tinny. no base. not worth 1 penny
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,"Great Product, Shouldn't Be Used With 12V Equipment.","I'll be the second engineer to tell you not to use this product with any 12V equipment. Devices require some fixed amount of power to operate and when you supply 5V to a device that expects 12V, it's going to get the power, at the expense of drawing over twice as much current. This will cause the device to operate outside its operating specifications, probably run hotter, and probably fail earlier"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,I use Verbatim 16X  4.7 GB DVD+R's myself,My current DVD writer???  NEC ND3550A 
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Does the job,"It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue)."
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Samsung DVD Recorder,"This is a well made product.  Recording is very easy... BUT the instructions!  They must have been translated, verbatim from Chinese.  Very little makes sense, but you can probably muddle through and make a decent DVD with little trouble.  I'd love to REALLY know how to make ""chapters"" on my DVDs... the manual, which is BIG, doesn't really tell you all that much about HOW to do things.  If you can't set the clock on your VCR, you might want to think twice about trying this product.  All in all, I'd buy it again... I just wish they'd had someone from North America write the manual"
electronics,,1.0,Not so good,"The range of reception on this USB 108 wireless adapter is not strong or reliable. I have always had great reception and speed using my Netgear 108 network card, but using the same computer and just changing to the USB adapter I have found that the reception and speed is not even an tenth as good as my original card. I will be returning the item. Unfortunately my PC's standard internal wireless card is better and faster than the Netgear USB.-- Sorry"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Vantec LapCool3 USB Notebook Cooling Pad,"The fans work great.  They are not variable speed fans but they come with an on/off switch on the cord.  The biggest drawback is the use of plastic.  The plastic is quite flimsy for bigger laptops, especially the grills over the fans.  If you aren't careful the plastic can be easily pushed down into the fan"

electronics,,5.0,Fantastic battery Saver!,"I bought this backup battery pack for a recent trip to Europe and it is amazing. I also used rechargeable batteries and it worked like crazy. I never ran out of power and I used it almost every day for music and video. The video on my ipod was way better than the screen on American Airlines, and wayyyyy better than the movie/television choices American Airlines had to choose from. Cheers"
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,The only one,This Sangean pocket radio is the only one I can find of this size that has AM/FM and TV audio . I have had them for the past 12 years and hope they keep making them  this way for a long time .
electronics,3 of 3,1.0,TigerDirect = BAD EXPERIENCE,"The device I received worked alright for my first test recording. I recorded a song from vinyl to 256 kbps mp3 using a Sandisk 512k USB flash drive. After that, the unit kept freezing up while I was trying to adjust levels. After repeated attempts of turning unit off and on, waiting for the right indicators, setting file type, setting recording level and freezing, I packed it up. Seems to be an overheating problem. What is really frustrating is that I don't know if this is just one defective unit, or a general problem with the iKey, because THE UNIT I RECEIVED FROM TIGERDIRECT WAS A PREVIOUSLY USED, OPEN BOX. Both the outer and inner seals were broken and there were marks on the iKey. YMMV, but I am no longer buying from TigerDirect"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Super.fi is Super Fly!,"This is my first purchase of what I consider to be expensive headphones.  I definitely do not regret it.  It is well worth the money.  Grant it, as others have said, getting the right earpiece cover to fit perfectly is a chore.  However, once you find the perfect fit, it is wonderful.  You have to be careful because the noise-isolation works so well that even on a low volume setting, it's hard to hear what's going on around you.  You can still hear, but it is not the same as wearing the usual headphones that come with most mp3 players, walkmans, etc.  "
electronics,3 of 4,5.0,Pixma MP800,"Very good printer. Extremely easy to print photos. Only issue is that I need to turn it off to boot up my computer and then turn it back on and reset my paper choices, etc. Even with that issue, I really like it for everyday use and photo printing"
electronics,19 of 19,4.0,Excellent sound quality. Questionable unit finish. Good software. Poor documentation.,"  I purchased this unit because Nuance, the publishers of Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 gave it higher marks than the Olympus DS-2 I already own. My review of Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 appears elsewhwere. Suffice it to say that the software is superb with nearly 100% accurate voice recognition. My dream has been to be able transcribe dictation from a recorder to a finished document."
electronics,4 of 5,4.0,Fax Me or is it Fax you?!,"Actually, this is a great fax machine for folks that aren't too technically inclined (like me)...but I had it set up and running within 30 minutes. The only reason this didn't get a fifth star was that there is no catch tray for incoming faxes...they just fall on the floor! Also, the digital recorder for your greeting is horrible, but the message system does do a good job of recording incoming messages...This really is a good machine for the money as most HP products are..."
electronics,14 of 16,5.0,Get what you pay for,"I have 512MB and 1GB ATP card.  I use them with my mp3 player and digital camera and I never had any problems.  Before buying ATP brand I did research on the web and found that many people using other brands have problems such as file corruption, their devices don't work well when card is filled to capacity or card just dies.  I bought ATP because it's professional grade, they even put that in writing on the package.  It works great every time.  I guess you get what you pay for"
electronics,2 of 4,4.0,Does the job; good price!,The card works well in my camera and was purchased at a good price compared to several other sources.  No problems with delivery

electronics,45 of 51,1.0,"If you plan to use this for more than 6 months, don't buy","I bought two of these units, exactly one week apart.  I liked the first one so much, I bought a second one for the family room.  6 months later, almost to the day, the DVD drive on the first unit stopped working (I had to take the thing apart to extract the trapped DVD).  One week later, on the second unit, the VHS tray began seeing a tape even though none was loaded which meant I couldn't load a real tape.  So, 6 months after buying two combo units, I now have one DVD player and one VCR"
electronics,,4.0,Owned these for two years - eventually broke,"Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable."
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,PIECE OF CRAP STOPPED WORKING THE SAME DAY,"I got this Item and it worked for about 4 hours, then stopped working, I tried the reader in 2 different computers nothing... I contacted Lexar customer support and they couldn't help me, save your money and buy something else"
electronics,,2.0,"Dated design, better units available","I purchased one of these when new back in 2004.  The unit has worked ok for me, with the main quirk being about once every hour or two, I go through a 3 - 5 minute period of bad reception, presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another.  I was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak, but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from Crutchfield.  "
electronics,9 of 9,4.0,Holds surprising amount,"I've had this product for a few months now, and haven't filled it yet- and most of what I carry on it involves powerpoint presentations with many photos. I'm even buying a second one as a Christmas gift."

electronics,1 of 2,4.0,"The wheel itself is awesome, the software has some kinks","I think that the wheel itself is excellent for the price. I play Richard Burns Rally with it, and it does its job very well. The wheel itself is sturdy. The clamping system for the wheel to stay put on the desk fits almost anywhere in any position, normal or odd. My desk is on a corner and it fits on the corner of my room. The moniter is on the center where this corner is, so usually, most things have trouble fitting, but this fits almost perfectly. My only trouble I had with installing this was that the software was out of date and was not compatible with XP. It took me a bit to realize that, but the website had the newer drivers. The software itself is confusing and sort of iffy, however, it is not too bad and it does it's job. Its conveinient but also problematic because the wheel calibrates itself as you play, it's not a perfect system, but it does the job. The only other qualm I have is that the cord for the pedal to the wheel is short, but I have special requirements so it's all good"
electronics,6 of 8,1.0,monster is a advertising firm period,"Monster states that you need gold connectors cause copper corrodes, this is true. But they don't tell you that the same contact that was made between your speaker cable and speaker binding post is now taking place inside your new plug. Has monster some how defeated science and found a way to create an oxygen free environment inside their products that prevents corrosion and thereby signal loss. NO the only thing they have defeated is common sense. Put your cable in a good spade lug and drip some solder in the tip. Cheaper and scientifically better"
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Nice printer with only a few problems,This is a solid printer with problems typical to HP photo printers.
electronics,,5.0,Wonderful Kitchen Appliance!,"I bought this product about 6 months ago at my sister-in-law's recommendation.  I wish I'd purchased one sooner!  I chose this model because you don't have to hold it closed to seal - it has an easy locking ""tab"" you engage so you get the correct pressure every time. This particular package also included bag storage, and the ability to choose different settings and accessories that came with it.  I really appreciate that I can store a roll of bag material right in the machine.  I wish this model came with the handheld unit, but unfortunately it did not.  It did come with a couple of cannisters and a wide variety of bags plus a wonderful instruction video and cookbook. The only negative is that the ""regular"" Food Saver bags seem pretty expensive.  You're supposed to be able to reuse them, but if I've stored meat in them I question reusing them since we don't have a dishwasher to sterilize the bags.  I've found that I can use another brand of vacuum sealer bags to achieve an effective storage package at a lower cost for bags that I know I will throw away.  Buy one if you can!"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,"""Lost Connection"" Horrid design, and disgusting response time!","Between the constant dropped signals, the delay in waking up from ""sleep mode"" and the horrendous battery life, about 3 hrs... I'd give this piece of junk 0 stars, but the ratings end at one... I also KNOW that it isn't my bluetooth adapter seeing as my wireless Apple keyboard works like a charm... I HATE THIS MOUSE! This is the second mouse that I have returned to amazon due to poor functionality."
electronics,13 of 13,4.0,"4, almost 5 stars!","This is most definatley a great product.  I have owned an old CDW-64 holder and I bought a new one about a year ago the same style as this CDW-128.  Both are extremley sturdy and have held up quite well even with the abuse I put them through.  I just bought this product and find it equal to the quality of those.  While padding could be a little better to prevent CD scratching, it comes as close to perfect as possible and is definatley a great buy"
electronics,10 of 11,4.0,Well..,I had read a few good and bad reviews on this cam. And I have to say I agree with both. I can take pictures and record myself but  I need to turn every light in my room on. But The pictures turn out pretty good. Even though nobody else can view I don't mind its like my own private show. they can hear me not that that will help. It was definitly worth the money

It's got a nice, clean look about it. Downside, unlike my old monitor, there's no place for my cat to sit on top"
electronics,23 of 26,1.0,Changing Combos,"I am a student living in a dorm situation and so wanted some basic protection for my lap top computer.  I purchased the defcon cl because it was inexpensive, widely availible, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, it has one major drawback, occasionally it decides to change the number combinationss which unlock it.  I went to the company website and they suggested trying the numbers immediately around the combination and if that failed trying all the number combinations possible (there are 10,000).  Several hours, one blister, and 1787 combinations later, I got frustrated and used a jewelers saw to cut through the connection to my computer (this solution took only five minutes).  I would not suggest this lock to anyone who lacks the patience to try trial and error experimentation until they reach the correct combination, nor anyone attending a school with a metalsmithing program"

electronics,4 of 4,4.0,USB 2 Reader,"Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements"
electronics,5 of 6,2.0,"Great Sound, Poor Design",I was very excited to use these with my laptop. Cargo magazine had reviewed them in their October November issue as Best in Class.

electronics,7 of 7,5.0,It's exactly what I was looking for.,"I just purchased a new Palm Z22 and definitely wanted a nice compact carrying case.  This was perfect.  It's a suede leather, small (only the size of the Palm, but thicker) and has a wrist strap.  It zips closed so I don't need to worry about velcro attaching to everything in my bag.  The Palm Z22 fits perfectly in it. The case has a mirror, although not a good one, but I didn't really need one, so I stuck the ""graffiti"" coding sheet to it.  I haven't filled it with credit cards or anything.  Probably just put some of my business cards in there.  I know it didn't have good reviews previous to mine, but they may have had different needs.  I like that it was made specifically for the Z22"
electronics,2 of 7,2.0,Don't Buy this Product,"When a company does not even have the resources to sell you a product you know something is seriously wrong. An example: I tried to phone purchase a software update for my Garmin 2610. After being put on hold for over an hour I gave up. Then I tried several e-mails but only got form letter answers. Note, I was not trying to get a repair but was actually trying to make a purchase. If this is how they treat would be paying customers then you can only guess how they will treat you if, for instance, you want a repair. This is a company that one should STEER CLEAR OF. As for the product itself, many units have severe defects; most notably they fail to find satellite reception. When it does work it is ok, but one simply can't count on it to work and contacting the company is just about impossible."

I tried reformatting it in the camera, but I'm getting a ""Cannot access card"" error message.  Never had this kind of trouble with SanDisk Ultra II CF cards.  Fortunately I had just moved photos off of it before it decided it wanted to have a nervous breakdown.  But I will not be buying any more Kingston products.  Too unreliable. "
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Excellent Product,"Easy to use, and understand.  I love that it's color coded to match popular products i.e. Sony.  I was sick of buying batteries for my CD player at work, now I can use the juice from the wall like normal people"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,I like it...it works,"This product works for me. I'm always worried bout dropping it and/or getting scratches on it. But this item helps. The reason it got a 4 instead of a 5 was because it has a plastic part which covers the screen,which is helpful, but sometime i wonder if it scratches the screen itself. Something to remember, DO NOT TAKE OFF THE PLASTIC, the plastic that covers the screen when you first get it. I suggest not taking it off. I did on my first ipod and that got scratched up bad. But overall, this product does help. It doesn't make it that much bulkier, but im willing to put a little bit of bulkiness on the line over scratches and potentially breaking my ipod. But thats just me.."

electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Pretty Good Unit - Good Set of Features,Overall I'm pleased with the unit and believe it will be handy indeed come a power outage.  A few issues (beyond the basic feature set tradeoff designed into the unit) I've experienced with 2 separate units tested:

The switch burned out. Contacted Netgear warranty support only to learn I need an RMA number to return the switch. But I can't get an RMA number because Netgear runs an automated phone system that routes you to a disconnected number. After two months of trying and sending email messages to their customer support department the problem remains. After 90 days forget about any Netgear product warranty

Even if you want to play a game not on the list the Merc still works great! 5/5 stars"
electronics,42 of 44,1.0,Dont waste your money,"A $10 cable does the same thing.  Do not believe the hype.  Monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it.  Its digital, 1s and 0s.  Either it reads it or it doesnt."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Cable,"It may be true that optical cables all provide the same quality but not everyone that buys Monster optical cables will try refuting this.  I buy Monster in general because of the durability as well as the quality, but in optical's case I bought this cable knowing that it should last as long as my equipment will.  And for $20, that's not a bad investment.  I have to admit though that I bought an Arista Fiber Optic cable which is just as good, four times the length and cheaper, but how long it will hold up against all the foot-traffic, I don't know.  For the price I think either are fair"

Great choice, as it installed and works flawlessly. Great memory expansion for this phone - no fuss, no muss. I only wish they had a 4 - 8 GB version that worked as well, for the same price !!  I can keep dreaming, I know !!  Seriously, though - Kingston has always worked well for me, and this is another success with their products. Highly recommended."
electronics,,5.0,Great Product,"After going through more than ten different manufactures of DVD+R media I have to say I have had the best results with these.  Close to 100% burn rate with excellent playback on most players, except Sony, (though I'm using a Sony burner).  One batch had some duds at the end of the cake and Amazon replaced the whole thing promptly"

Sure, memory geeks like me may find little things like this more awe-inspiring than the next...but practically speaking it is good for more than just the techno geek.  What this large amount of memory provides is a way to store tons of pictures, movies, ringtones, etc. over a long period of time...and then you can ""dump"" it onto your computer.  The other thing you can do with it is store a lot of music to play on your phone.."
electronics,9 of 9,5.0,A GREAT TYPEWRITER!!,I got this typewriter and love it! It works great and has been very reliable. It does all those neat little things a typewriter should and is a great bargain for about $100. The best part? No viruses or software conflicts like that of a PC. Excellent for people who just like to type. By the way (in reference to the review below)...
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,"Worked great, but needed a lot of recharging","I used this throughout Europe, transferring images from my Konica-Minolta A-200 (8 Mega-pixel) camera.

electronics,2 of 2,5.0,RocketFM + Tivoli Model One = Marriage Made in Heaven,"You need a good receiver: I get my news from DemocracyNow.org daily, and listen as well to all classical radio on the internet and was at first disgusted with the 10 foot range of the signal transmitted my Rocket FM USB powered FM transmitter (Rocket FM plugs into a computer's USB port and converts my humble iBook into a mini FM radio station so we can listen to internet audio on any FM radio). In addition, there would be signal interference when we just walked around the room. To the rescue: a Henry Kloss AM/FM table radio by Tivoli Audio. It makes my housemates' Phillips boombox sound like a cheap violin. Not only that, but I put the Model One in the bedroom a full 36+ feet (passing through three double wood-joist drywalls) and the sound is still great (no, I am no audiophile, but...). Add 18 ft. and another double wall and slight static appears"
electronics,2 of 3,2.0,"Very nice keyboard, but one major Microsoft flaw!!","I've had this keyboard for a couple of years now, and I really like it except for one MAJOR flaw.   The keyboard legs keep breaking and falling off!!  I've called Microsoft to reorder them, and they don't even sell a replacement  for the keyboard legs, not for this or any of their other keyboards!!  So if one of your two keyboard legs breaks (they usually break one at a time), make sure you have super glue handy. I've glued my left one  4 times already at 4 difft places!!  That's how cheap these keyboard legs are made.  Shame on Microsoft. They want us to buy a brand new keyboard when a keyboard leg breaks!! Microsoft! Please make and at least sell  us some replacement keyboard legs, or make your cheap keyboard legs better!!! "
electronics,5 of 14,5.0,Last review about 5volts versus 12volts is incorrect,"The last review saying this product will not work with Linksys's 12volts products is incorrect.  The general rule of thumb is NOT to supply a HIGHER voltage than the device specification recommends because you will definitely damage your device, including make it smoke.  For example, never input 12volts into a device which requires 5volts.  However, if you input 5 volts into a device which requires 12 volts, the device will usually be OK.  The Linksys POE works perfectly with all my 5 volts access points, some which are not even Linksys"
electronics,8 of 10,5.0,Great for the price,Great for the price. I recommend it just for storage
electronics,5 of 5,1.0,Doesn't Fit Unit,"It won't plug into my Street Pilot, as the plug is different.  I'm sure it fit some unit, but it's a door stop for me.  What units it fits should be better described or corrected"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,fantastic item,Makes you wonder what we did before cd-roms!  Great device-- works in any of my computers-- great to back up large amounts of data
electronics,,5.0,Their HP ink cartridges... what can I say.,They work.  They seem to last a long time under light home use.  Amazon was the best place to buy them from after I did a lot of research on Google/Froogle/Pricegrabber/etc.  Always have an extra Black and Color cartridge as backups... you'll thank me later
electronics,,1.0,Get the Coby 224 instead!,"Skip this DVD Player and buy the Coby 224 instead. Usually the 224 can be found for under $30. It plays NTSC and Pal, and also has the codes to be a region free player. I have had mine over a year and love it. It is a small, solid little workhorse"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Pretty good for the price,I'm writing a review on the Koss R-80. First off I had a pair of Koss UR20. These Koss R-80 off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design. The headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head. It has a coiled cord which can be removed. The cord is connected like a phone card. 
electronics,3 of 10,5.0,Product desciption could be more specific,"I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you ""must"" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice"

electronics,3 of 6,1.0,No longer supports TV listings,I was pleased with both remotes although on one the channel and volume buttons died but Harmony in their wisdom decided to eliminate the TV listings on all their models out of the blue
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,GREAT external storage solution,"This driver is excellent!  Definitely a plug and play solution, didn't/doesn't/hasn't crashed windows and when my system shut down due to power failure, the driver picked up where it left of with my transfer, not losing any data.  I would purcase another and would also recommend it to friends and colleagues. "
electronics,10 of 10,4.0,Sony Walkman,"Enjoying it a great deal. Some stations seem to drift, but otherwise it being so compact it is a huge improvement on my other walkman. I walk at least 3 miles daily so it is my constant companion.  It keeps excellent time.  Using a single AAA battery is another huge plus.  And the battery lasts a very long time"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,My Favorite Non-Custom IEM,"First off, all the reviewers before me mentioning correct insertion are correct. These things demand a deep fit within the ear canal (espeically for the triflanges) for them to sound properly."
electronics,,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I received this item as a gift, and it is the worst laptop cooler I have come across.  After 8 months, the right fan broke.  Before it broke, it was annoying anyway, because the fans were so loud - louder than the fans on my HP Pavilion zd8000 - which aren't the quietest.  The pad also isn't very smart - it always stays on"
electronics,,5.0,Canon Pro paper review,This paper is one of the best on the market. Colors come out with eye catching clarity and brilliance. Mid-tones are vivid and blacks are black. Would recomend it for anyone who demands quality prints.
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Very short life,"These foams are really good both in terms of providing music quality and comfort for your ears, but they don't last long! First of all, they get dirty very quickly, just from being handled (and from your ear canal, no matter now clean it is). I had read somewhere that you can wash them, so I did, but that washed off the coating which gives them shape memory (allows them to stay squeezed when you're inserting them in your ear and expand afterwards). After the washing they'd just expand right after being squeezed, like regular foam does, and hence it was impossible to insert them into my ears anymore. Even if you don't wash them and put up with the dirty look, that coating wears off after a couple of weeks just from handling, which pretty much kills the ear bud."
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Great Portable Radio!,"Bought 5 of these radio's for practically nothing.  OK, one was a dud.  However, the ones that worked REALLY worked and have continued to work for two years now!  Great reception and sound.  Channel and volume lock feature is very helpful.  Use mine when I ride to work on my motorcycle.  Great adjunct to a satellite radio receiver.  The combination provides full stereo radio anywhere on any road.  Local channels come in great and the digital lock is wonderful.  As for the bad one, it consumed batteries like crazy.  However, if you bought two to get one great one, it's well worth it.  Maybe the lack of quality control on the production line warrants a lower rating, but for a cyclist or motorcycle rider on a daily commute, I've found no better product and I've tried dozens.  Buy two"
electronics,25 of 25,5.0,Forget RadioShack,"The splitter my cable company installed degraded the signal on the bigscreen TV, especially on the lowest (2-6) and highest 54-60) channels. The cable tech wanted to sell me a powered signal amp for $32. It worked, but I passed and bought this model. The results were as good as the fancy booster, without the fuss"
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,I don't know how anyone flies without them,"I don't know how anyone flies without these. I wondered why my simulator approaches were so pathetic, turns out that a little rudder is good for those tiny course corrections you need to put the plane down right where you want it. These feel pretty solid. The only drawbacks I've found are that they're a little pricey, and some sims don't support them well"
electronics,7 of 12,4.0,Fine so far,"I've only had it a couple of days, and it's fine so far."
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Clear as a bell,"I purchased this unit for my church for those who need hearing assistance.  I connect to a constant output from our PA system.  No problems at all.  Pull out of the box, charge, and use.  Tuning is easy and steady.  Range is excellent.  I use these with a set of Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo Speakers for monitors and nursery speakers.  Everything runs off of one transmitter right through the walls.  Expanding this system is effortless.  Little to no interference.  Self adjusting headband is a little clumsy for older people.  That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars"
electronics,16 of 16,5.0,Good Deal!!!,"Order this to try and save on money since I didnt need a whole lot of outlets, I pluged my computer to it and TV. On a full battery It was able to run for about 5-10mins with my 32' CRT tv and 19' LCD monitor + comp. Good enough for me to power down the computer, would last longer if the TV was off im sure"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Quickcam is great,The camera is a great little thing.  Comes with a little case to keep it protected.  Nice clean pictures
electronics,,5.0,The best headset I've tried/owned.,I have tried several headsets and USB phones for use with VoIP calls using Skype.

electronics,2 of 3,2.0,fleecing loyal apple buyers,"The first thing I did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually WAS an Apple product.  Its REALLY cheap looking.  Looks like something you'd find for [...] at a flea market or in the ""stocking stuffers"" section of the dollar store at Christmas time. The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit."
electronics,2 of 12,1.0,WOW ITS BEEN ONLY...... ONE MONTH?,"If your a hardcore gamer, i would not recommend this mouse. After a month of intensive training in CS Source, the MX310 stoped working properly. The LED turns on and off, jamming your curser every 5 seconds, making it EXTREMELY ANNOYing to use my computer in general. What i really dislike is the ""Technical Service."" They give a number that doesn't work and that most likly is located in India. Never again Logitch, im sticking with Microsoft"
electronics,40 of 42,4.0,Great Card,"I had bought a digital camera and found the standard 16MB that typically comes with a digital camera highly insufficient. So I got myself a Kingston 256MB CF for my Canon S230.  It works great!  Definitely faster than the generic one that came with the camera.  I have yet to fill up the card.  On top of that, I use it as a portable hard-drive to transport data between my desktop at work and my laptop"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,"WOW!  Solid construction, almost overkill.","I mainly bought this for its reliability, # of outlets and (most of all) the CleanPower feature.  Funky / dirty AC power is one of the leading causes of shortened life expectancy for electronics.  Some things I noticed:"
electronics,0 of 6,5.0,Awesome dvd storage,I use this for storing all my dvds i either burned or bought. It takes up way less space than all those individual cases!
electronics,5 of 5,5.0,Great Storage and Price,I fit about 550 photos (each taken at 7MB resolution setting) and several movies - one 187MB long - on this Sony 2BG Memory Stick PRO Duo. It was the only one I needed for my 2-week trip. It was an amazing bargain for under $100.
electronics,,5.0,An excellent mouse,I have now had this mouse for five years with no problems.  I first bought the mouse because I hate trying to get lint off those little wheels inside a mouse so the ball runs smoothly.  The optical technology is a God send. 
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,"Good for mowing the lawn, part duex","I will echo vander-reviewers comments about this headset.  They don't cancel the roar of my Deere, but they attenuate it to a comfortable level making it possible to enjoy music while I mow.  It takes some adjustment to get it to fit comfortably over a ball cap and sunglasses, if not you'll notice some discomfort after an hour or so.  (Lucky vander-r, my lawn takes 4 hours on a good day.)  "
electronics,17 of 45,1.0,"""Colored can"" for those who don't know the sound of real music instruments ","This Headphones and most of the high-end Sennheiser are very well tune to catch the ears of those ""audio enthusiast"" who think they know the real sound but they actually never even know how to play a music instrument."
electronics,2 of 2,2.0,Couldn't see or map drive,"I have a home network with 2 PCs and a notebook with wireless connection.  The ""find network wizard"" worked fine - until the map network drive part.  Couldn't get this thing to work even after many attempts on my part and those of an outside tech consultant.  Tried to call Simpletech tech support.  First try:  recording - hours of service are M-F 5:30 am to 6:30 pm pacific time.  Weekend warriors are out of luck until Monday.  Second call during the prescribed hours: waited on hold for over 30 minutes.  Gave up and returned the thing.  May work on your system, but this was a dud for me"
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Excellent 5-Port 10/100 Switch,"I've been using this switch non-stop for over two years now and have never had any kind of problem.  It's a great little switch that's definitely worth the money.  All the ports are in the back, the casing has a brushed aluminum look, and it's fanless, so it's definitely possible to leave it sitting on the desk.  Since the ""switching fabric"" supports 1GB/sec, that means each of the five ports can carry their full 200MB/sec (100MB/sec each way) capacity without problem.  The darn thing doesn't even get warm.  Definitely a good buy (I rate it at 5 stars out of 5)."

electronics,5 of 6,1.0,BEWARE!!!!  Can't roll back the hands of time...,"We did quite well with these speakers when our daughter had an iPod-Mini.  When she got her ""new""  iPod for Xmas of '05,  we ran into such bad luck with it (the iPod...)  We kept taking it to the ""Genius Bar"" and they (God bless 'em!) ended up replacing the iPod 3 times.  THEN - we found out that the round speakers actually ERASE THE HARD DRIVE of the current iPods!!!!  If you have an older iPod,  go for it.  If you have a newer one - you are simply asking for trouble.  I don't see these in the Apple Stores any more for a good reason "
electronics,6 of 6,5.0,Perfect for 2+ years under heavy use.,"I have nothing to report, that is, the device has performed flawlessly in the 2+ years I have owned it.  I subjected this thing to almost every scenario except Mac.  Read on..."

electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Optical Mouse Review,"I liked the Labtec Optical Mouse, it was well priced and provide the right features.  I like the Optical feature, so there is no roller ball and I also like the center wheel.  In fact, I will not purchase a mouse without the center wheel.  Overall, it fulfilled my need well and at a good price"

electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works as advertised,"I purchased this router in May 2006.  I wanted to get familiar with the router before posting a review.  Some of the negative responses I see regarding this router makes me wonder how long did the person actually had the router before reporting ""it doesn't work as advertised"" or ""no "
electronics,1 of 1,1.0,DESTROYED MY iPOD!!!,"when this item arrived, I was very excited to hook it up and use it with my iPod mini. But when I hooked it up, I noticed that my click wheel was completely non-respondent. I sent my iPod back to apple thinking that it was the fault of the iPod, not the speakers. Well about an hour ago, my brand new iPod came in the mail. I hooked it up to the speakers and the same thing happened!!! DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS!!! even though i was covered by apple, i still had to pay thirty bucks just to get it there. CTA digital better be paying for my iPod or I will be forced to take legal actions"
electronics,,5.0,iPod Power Source for Car,This little gizmo plugs into cigarette lighter-like outlet in my car and powers my iPod when my battery gets low.  It works just fine.  No issues after several months of use
electronics,,4.0,Good deal for two phones,"These phones work well and having two phones eliminates the need for additional batteries.  I like the fact that there is an indicator that shows how much ""juice"" remains in the battery -- when it gets down to one or two ""bars"" just put the phone in either of the bases"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Head and shoulders above the stock ipod headphones,"My stock Apple ipod headphones developed a crackle in the left bud soon after purchase, but instead of going through a process to get new ones under warranty I decided to get better ones.  This pair is exceptional! Full bodied with great definition -- and that's comming from a guy with over $1000 in Klipsch speakers in his front room! A great pair of headphones for cheap-- they sound almost as good as my $100 Sony large headphones (which are just too big to wear anywhere except in the house). A++++ for the price"
electronics,,4.0,Interesting to note,"Logitech paid THX in order to display that certification on their speakers.   Just think about this.  The speakers would sound just as good without the that THX logo, but now imagine how much they would probably cost if they did not have the logo.  They'd be even cheaper is what I am getting at.  In my opinion they are already cheaper. Compare to Bose's 2.1 system which retails for over 200 dollars.  What nerve Bose has at jipping consumers.  These speakers are not perfect.  First off I really was irritated by distortion that came across sometimes when I played the music really loud.  I don't know if I was just the unlucky one to get it.  It only happened during the intial stages of ownership.  After having it for awhile, it stopped.  These were fantastic speakers; I ended up giving them to my brother.  I upgraded to the 5.1 z-5500.  I just wanted true surround sound.  Anyway, they do get 5-stars because as I said, for the price, they sound incredible and I think that it was the best decision I made in an electronics buy all of last year"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Wired/wireless combo works well,"The Wireless-G router is the one I use at home. At the time I picked it up, it seemed like the perfect combination of a wired router and a wireless router for connecting to cable or DSL. Set up (including pulling out my old hub, router, and wireless) took less than 10 minutes and best of all everything worked for me the first time. Now I have 1 device to replace the clutter I had in the corner under my desk for years and years. If you can get the model with SRX400 speed and range expansion, that's the best one. The range boost is huge over the standard model"
electronics,,5.0,mini disc purchase,I ordered the mini disc product through amazon.  I received the product in a timely manner.  I was pleased with the whole process.  Thanks for your efforts.
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Finally a product that lives up to the hype!,"I am a relatively new (2nd season) NFL Season/Ticket holder and had noticed a few people sprinkled throughout the section my seats are in were using head-sets to get the local play by play.  I originally purchased a much more expensive Sony Walkman Model #SRF-HMD3V FM/AM & TV they have a verticle sliding interior ear piece that I found very uncomfortable to wear due to limited flexibility.  They were difficult to operate and ate up battery power like it was going out of style.  There is no comparison to the Sony SRFH14 Analog Tuning AM/M Headphone Radio.  It is much less expensive, easy to operate, and I am still only on my first original set of batteries.  It is comfortable to wear and the reception is fantastic.  One out of two isn't bad? Thank you for another great product!"
electronics,13 of 14,4.0,Quite Pleased,Purchased it through Radio Shack due to a gift card I received. Definitly advise that you buy the extended warranty. When I first used mine I listened to half the movie with the built in speakers and then switched to

electronics,,5.0,I'm sorry if you missed the deal that I got!!!,"I purchased this Transpod during summer of '06 when the price was under $30! I am completely satisfied with the product; there are so many ways to install and connect the transpod. I have read other reviews criticizing the ""bulkiness"" and ""poor FM reception"" of the transpod. If you like choices, then this is your product. As with the ""poor FM reception"", all I can say is find and use another FM frequency. Others that experience problems are dwellers in an urban setting; those may seek other solutions"
electronics,12 of 14,2.0,Battery problems (as usual for Creative),"The battery, which is claimed by Creative to last ""up to"" 7 hours, lasts about 2 hours. So, if you need this gadget for hiking or such, be sure to carry extra batteries. I have had similar experience with other Creative devices. Apparently, their marketing department is completely detached from their"
electronics,41 of 42,1.0,Not very useful,"I don't find this to be that useful. The only benefit is that it holds the iPod upright (it has a line out feature, but that's not why I purchased it and I won't use that). I assumed (incorrectly) that it came with it's own power cord, so that it would, by itself, charge the iPod. You must purchase a separate plug or use the USB jack that it came with. I wanted an addition means of charging the nano. Had I known that it was just a base, I wouldn't have purchased this item, certainly not for $30. For me, the utility of this isn't worth more than a few bucks, and I'm not exactly the miser type"
electronics,28 of 28,5.0,Entry level price with top end sound!!! ,"I am a hi-fi fan and enjoy listening to classical music through my Senn HD-600 headphones and Grado HP-1000 headphones and, in the day time, through my JBL 4311 studio monitor speakers which is backed up by my McIntosh stereo system. I own about a dozen other headphones which are considered by many to be among the best. I even own Ultimate Ears UE-10 custom in ear monitors (IEM's)."

electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Avoid Creative products,"At first I was happy with this mp3 player- good sound, easy to use, 20gb, fm radio and good value.  But....quickly I realized I had made a very bad decision.  Most importantly, it stopped working after only 6 months! Also dust also collects under imediately and the software lacks obvious features such as playing by artist (rather than Artist then Album). "
electronics,,5.0,Does the Job,What can I say? This product does the job. No problems so far. Buy it
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,First Pair of Noise Cancelling Headphones and I'm Pleased,"I purchased a Panasonic 9"" DVD-LX95 and these headphones came with the package. Reading a few of these reviews I thought I was in for a real problem with the audio and I would have to use my sony headphones, for instance a lot of people are complaining about hissing noises. I have not experienced any of these problems. These headphones work great. I hear lots of bass, crystal clear voices and absolutely no hissing noises."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Viking CF256M 256 MB CompactFlash Card,The card works fine.  I have already gotten much use from this product and like it better that SanDisk and other similar compact flash card products that I have purchased
electronics,8 of 8,4.0,Prepare Yourself,This is a good product at a good price. Got a few tips tho. Do not expect things to work on first try prefectly be prepared to waste a t shirt or test the paper on a pillow case. Cut close to the edge not right on or else it doesn't adhear properly causing it to wash off. Yellow oust side means you burnt it. All in all good product to try
electronics,,4.0,Good Keyboard!,"This does the job.  It does seem to be a little delicate, so I open and close it very slowly and carefully, but once it is open, it does a great job.  I had a little trouble with repeating keys at first, but once I turned on the keyboard sound, I can tell when it is happening before I look up and see 500 X's on the screen.  It was worth the money"
electronics,,4.0,"Excellent sound, design so-so.","The sound on these headphones are excellent. The first time I put these on and heard the bass response, I took them off to make sure my regular speakers weren't playing also. Excellent highs and little to no distortion. Very respectable sound. They are very comfortable once adjusted and on."

I can also play CDRs now, something my stereo hasn't been able to do for six months"
electronics,6 of 7,5.0,LOVE MY NANO PLUS!,"I love to know about new technologies and keep up with them...but it takes me awhile to purchase them...When I decided I needed an MP3 player, I just really didn't need a video or enough space for every piece of music that I ever owned....and I didn't want to spend a fortune."
electronics,,5.0,Great Purchase,"I live in NYC, tough to get reception on AM stations. This radio works great, gets excellent reception on both AM and FM"
electronics,0 of 4,1.0,Be careful when purchasing!!!!,"I bought this for my computer, and it is useless.  The unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine.  Be very careful when purchasing these.  I would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend.  APC has offered to give me a discount on a new one if I use this as a trade in, but it would cost me a fortune to ship it.  Tiger Direct will (according to the website) only guarantee items against defect.  Therefore, I'm left with an expensive doorstop.  Don't make the same mistake, research before you buy!  My 19"" monitor and Pentium 4 are too much for the 350VA"
electronics,1 of 2,2.0,Kensington WiFi Finder Plus,"Problem 1.  The finder states it should find BlueTooth, but even if I hold it next to my Treo 650 with Blue Tooth enabled no light shows.  Problem 2.  My laptop detects wireless networks with strong signals, the Kensington product did not find whatso ever.  I do not recommend this product at all."
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,So far so good- and it comes with goodies they don't tell you about.,"I only got this 3 months ago so I can't speak to its longevity. I was looking for something simple that I could use on the treadmill and this has worked great. I also cannot speak to how many songs it can hold- I have less than 150 on there and I know the write up says it holds a lot more than that. The dial on the side takes some getting used to. But it sounds good, I found it easy to put the music in there (I'm not exactly a genius when it comes to these things) and it's small and easy to have around. Also, mine came with a belt clip and an armstrap- it didn't say that in the description. So no real complaints- I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a simple mp3 player."
electronics,8 of 8,1.0,I returned this system in one week,"It came down to a choice between a $40 sound system with a seperate dvd player or this $200 system. The reason I purchased it was because it would save on space. Well, it may save on space, but the functionality was reduced to nearly ZERO. The cons:"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,"The Gold, uh, Silver Standard in Financial Calculators","No, the quality heft and feel of the original (1981) 12C calculators made in Oregon, USA, is not quite there in the latest ""Made in China"" incarnation. But just about everything else is better than the original, including speed of program execution (3-5X faster), number of programmable steps (now 400), and additional support for Algebraic input mode on top of the default RPN. Now it even has an Undo function, albeit one of fairly limited usefulness, in addition to the fairly useful backspace function. This thing is still the ""gold"" standard in its category, with a silvery finish or otherwise"
electronics,1 of 2,5.0,"Wonderful lock, but not compatible with newer security slots","This is the best lock you can buy, provided that it fits your slot. It worked flawlessly on my iBook G4, and I have heard of other people using it in other computers to their content."
electronics,7 of 7,4.0,Garmin i5 - (1) the good; and (2) opportunities for improvemnt,1- The Good) I bought the i5 this past summer.  It exceeded my expectations; it usually does a great job of getting me to my destination and identifying desired stops along the way.  Excellent customer-chosen voice options; excellent graphics; clear screen; clever mounting mechanism.  It's ready-to-go out of the box.  It doesn't speak the street names but I don't find that to be a hinderance.  
electronics,10 of 10,5.0,Great reader,"I spent $10 on a MediaGrear keychain CF card reader first. That reader is usable, but it is hard to pull my CF card out. I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card. When I plug the reader into my computer, it works immediately, no need to install any driver if you don't need to use that transfer button."
electronics,,4.0,Vtech Earphone,"My secretary used this earphone for a short period of time before switching to another.  She said it was uncomfortable.  For the price, it is sufficient but if you will be wearing it for an extended period of time you might want to pay a bit more"
electronics,76 of 81,1.0,Incredible rip-off,"$99.99 list price?  Over $70 actual price?  You've got to be kidding!  I never accuse companies of raping consumers, because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend, but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance.  If you want to connect your iPod to your home stereo, get a $7.00 ""stereo mini-plug to RCA plug Y-adapter"" at Radio Shack.  That's all you need.  Because you already have a recharger (it came with your iPod), the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your iPod upright. I have this item (it came free with my 40GB iPod) and, although it offers a slight convenience over not having it, the price is a terrible rip-off. "
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,creative travelsound 200 portable speaker system,Ordered these speakers to hook up to our laptop computer.  We wanted sound we could really hear.  We take our laptop with us on our sailboat when we go for a month at a time.  We take movies and the speakers are just great.  Good clear sound and plenty of volume.  Great little package and suits our needs wonderfully.  We would recommend these speakers to anyone
electronics,57 of 60,4.0,Map330 with base maps and uploadable detailed street maps,The Map330 arrived on Nov 20th.  It immediately locked on in after the power up in about 4 minutes with 6 satellites showing. I previously had a Garmin 45xl and a Garmin 12 with good success.  This GPS takes those 1 step further with built in Base maps and the &quot;free&quot; cd offer with a mail in rebate for no extra cost.  Unlike the current Garmin offers which cost an extra $100 for a map program.  This is an excellent offer for the current price.  The only cons that I have found with this unit is that the tracklogs will &quot;connect&quot; themselves to each other and that upon power up the first tracklog taken sometimes has a tendency to be far away from the actual location.  This is due to a poor satellite geometry and is not a problem with the unit.  These are minor shortcomings and the fact that I was able to load 1/2 of Pennsylvania with the 8 meg uploadable map storage is a nice bonus with this program.  If you have any questions on this or any other GPS I highly recommend that you go to the newsgroup:  sci.geo.satellite-nav .  The people there are very helpful and can answer any questions you may have.. Happy GPS'ing !!  l8tr...  Steve m..

electronics,14 of 17,5.0,Best Residential Phone System,"This is a great home phone system. It has all the bells and whistles. You can input your own color wallpaper display, name each phone for its location, no obtrusive antenna, great quality, I could go on and on. The voice caller ID is sometimes a little strange, but having owned the previous version of it I'm used to it. You will recognize what it is telling you in very short time. I bought this system (I'm using six phones and a camera)to replace a Meridian (Nortel) system that cost four times the price. The camera monitors the front door from a window in the dining room. I can see who is at the door from anywhere in the house in full color. This is the best one line system available"
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Creative speaker,"It arrived earlier than expected, was smaller than I envisioned and works as well as I hoped.  It really was just what I was looking for.  The other positive reviews I read were accurate, including the comments about the speakers lacking significant bass.  But still - I'm very pleased"

electronics,23 of 23,1.0,Hard to Read,"Quite simply, this caller ID display is too hard to read from any angle EVEN if it has brand new batteries in it, AND the contrast is turned up all the way.  The display is just too dim.  Save your money and don't buy this one"
electronics,4 of 5,5.0,These are great phones getting a bad rap! Ours work well - here's why...,"People complain of bad battery life, and we had this problem at first. I think what happens is that the batteries get old on the store shelf. Ours wouldn't hold a charge very long, so we called Motorola, and they cheerfully & quickly sent us new batteries. After that, everything was great. Like any NiCad product, I think you have to 1) follow the directions for the initial charge and 2) keep them on the base as much as you can. Our family has trouble returning them to the base, but they still are holding charges well after about 8 months."

electronics,21 of 22,2.0,Good for the simple minded,"This DVD is okay. It does what it advertises, but there are much better calibration DVDs out there. This DVD doesn't contain any audio calibration, which is what I also wanted. Some of the calibration on the DVD is too subjective for my taste. I really thought the music video at the end was rather pointless. If you're a guy with a short attention span, this DVD will probably work for you."
electronics,14 of 14,4.0,Works Great with Mac OS X Tiger,"ORIGINAL REVIEW : If you're a Mac user, ignore the warnings that this netcam requires Windows and Internet Explorer.  Nonsense! If you have ever set up a wireless router on your network (and if you are looking at an 802.11 camera then you probably have) then you will have no problem with this device.  There are two less-than-obvious things you need to do to get working: 1) hardwire the camera via an Ethernet cable for the initial set up (camera default LAN IP is 192.168.0.253) and 2) download the 114-page PDF Operating Instructions from the Panasonic support page.  Ignore the included CD-ROM."
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,A pleasant surprise!!,"OK, I bought this phone when my battery kept dying on my old phone. I decided I wanted a hands-free device which allows me to walk around the house doing chores while talking. I was slightly skeptical after looking at the head-set picture, but I thought for the price it was worth trying."
electronics,19 of 21,4.0,A great printer!,"The Cannon CP-10 is a wonderful printer.  The quality of the pictures is fantastic.  It also does a great job when printing the mini stickers.  The only down fall and the only reason I rated it a 4 and not a 5 is because it is not very easy to find a store that carries the paper/ink  set for the printer.  Other than that, if you are an instant gratification person this printer is for you"
electronics,,4.0,"It's ergonomic, has a cord, and it works.","Other than the elongated Delete key (on the right) being under the Home key (which used to be where the Insert key was), this keyboard has a nice feel to it. If the cord is not an issue, and you have the space for it (it's bigger than the standard keyboard), then it's worth it. Media and program keys are a bit much, but do add flexability."
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Excellent product,"We had been having a lot of problems with our mouse--skipping, difficulty maneuvering--and it turns out it was our mouse pad.  The Allsop pad has solved those problems.  It is a well-made product that completely serves the purpose for which it is intended.  A"
electronics,0 of 1,1.0,Ruined a good workout,"These are the worst headphones I have ever encountered. I would take the $5 kind that start to hurt your ears any day over these. The only way I could get them to stay in my ears was to stay still like a statue. I took them to work out and they kept falling out during my cardio. I looked like an idiot trying to stick them back in over and over until I finally gave up. I tried to talk to Philips about this problem and the guy told me that maybe I should have bought headphones that are designed for ""more active music listening"". Was he kidding? Shouldn't headphones be able to withstand 30 minutes on an eliptical? I wasn't on a trampoline or anything. From some of the other reviews, it seems like they will work for some people's ears, but not for everyone. Sadly, my husband and I both got a pair, so now we have double the disapointment. Steer clear of this set and get something that doen't have such mixed reviews"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Great offer!,I have searched many different places to get this product and this is the best I have seen. I believe I will be getting this product for an even cheaper price through my rep
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,"Hard case to recommend, for many reasons","I have many types of covers and cases for my iPod Nano and thought that this sleek alumninum addition would complete my collection. It doesn't, and here's why."
electronics,,5.0,Don't us anything else!,"I would not use anything but Canon printing paper with a Canon printer.  I tried another brand because I couldn't find any Canon paper in the store, it was terrible.  So I went on line and found just what I needed"
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,Good Price for Good Product,"I switched from a 3-Way radio shack splitter to the 4-way Monster Splitter and even though the signal is now split 1 extra time, the picture has improved on all TV's and the high speed internet speed has improved also. I though I was going to need an amplifier, but there was no need...Hope this helped "

electronics,0 of 2,5.0,"Lexar JDP1GB-231 JumpDrive Lightning 1 GB, 100X","(...)I am very pleased with the product, price and service.  I received it 5 days later and put it right to work and boy is it fast"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,works well,i replaced multiple 2 and 4 way splitters with this single one. picture quality across the tvs (i actually use all 8 outputs) is now slightly better. good price as well.
electronics,,5.0,HP 97 Ink Cartridge,I previously purchased this item from office supply stores.  Buying from Amazon.com saves me money and is very convenient.  The items always arrives promptly and in perfect condition.  I have never had a problem with this ink cartridge
electronics,1 of 8,1.0,IPODS STINK!!,Had a 4th gen 40 gig that just causes me headaches. Sent in 3 times to apple and now it does not connect to crappy itunes software.I am ebaying the ipod and getting a creative.
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,Almost Perfect....,"The video and sound playback on this unit is pretty awesome. The only thing that kind of sucks about it is the short battery life. I was only able to get about 2 hours of movie time per full battery charge. My solution to the short battery life was to pick up a batterygeek dvd battery which gave me an additional 7 hours of movie time per charge. In short, if I could go back in time I still would have bought the AMW-M520 however I just would have picked up that extended battery pack sooner"
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect for what I needed,"I am very happy with my Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks Pro.  It is very durable, sleek, portable, and reliable.  The software for it could be a little better (there is some junk ware that comes with it), but other than that, it has been a very good investment for me.  The mic is awesome!  I can talk comfortably 5 feet away without a headset, and it can still pick me up clearly.  The low light conditioning feature works well also."
electronics,15 of 16,4.0,I love it - can't beat it for the price.,"I own a home-based ecommerce business, and I am very pleased with this phone.  It handles the 2 lines nicely, the answering machine functions meet my needs.  We have 2 cordless phones that we use with the base unit, with headsets.  Works great.  With the addition of an Invotel AudioImage SX4400EZ Music-On-Hold adapter, I have music-on-hold capabilities - at a fraction of the cost.  I read the previous reviews that poo-poo this phone system.  Yes, it could have been better thought out in the design phase - as pointed out in the previous reviews.  However, I just don't think the cons come anywhere near the pros.  If I had it all to do over again, I'd still buy this phone system.  That's the greatest compliment I can give it"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,Great sound!  mediocre software,"I got this as a replacement for a malfunctioning built-in sound card.  The difference in sound quality is quite remarkable.  If I had known the difference would be so great, I would have got this earlier."
electronics,1 of 2,1.0,Didn't work for a Creative Zen Microphoto,Unfortunately it didn't work for my MP3 player
electronics,11 of 14,1.0,So so.,"I was looking for a coreded phone that I could plug my standard headset into.  I went to Staples to see which phones had this capability, and the Panasonic KX-TSC14B did, and at a reasonable price.  Please note that I did not require a 2-line phone; it seems that all phones with a headset jack (at least at Staples) were 2-line phones."
electronics,4 of 4,1.0,"WALK AWAY, DO NOT BUY","DEVICE GETS INTERFERENCE, AND POORLY MADE.  HARD TO PICK UP STATIONS, UNLESS YOUR STANDING UNDER THE RADIO TOWER.  JUST A BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD DEVICE.  I WOULD APRAISE THE ITEM AT NEGATIVE $15.00 YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY ME TO WEAR IT"
electronics,1 of 1,2.0,Sizing is an issue.,"In short, decent sound was not offset by a high degree of discomfort from wearing these.  They weren't particularly adjustable, and so if you don't have a head that happens to work for them, it's not going to work."
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Perfect for camcorder to PC/Mac firewire port,"This product works flawlessly, as advertised.  I was looking for a low-cost, quality, FireWire cable to connect my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder to my PC, to transfer HDV video.  I hooked up one end to the camera, the other end to the FireWire port on my PC, fired up the editing software, and started transferring video."
electronics,8 of 11,5.0,Reviews - Look at the 2GB version.,Take a look at the 2GB versions of the Creative Zen V for lots of reviews
electronics,2 of 2,4.0,Olympus Digital Recorders DS-2 great for in-depth interviews,"Back in Aug 2006, I purchased a Olympus Digital Recorders DS-2 for recording in-depth interviews. So far it has worked great! They recorder is light and the sound quality of the recorder is pretty good despite the fact that I have been recording in places such as night clubs, bars, and streets where there is a lot of background noise. With the digital recorders, I am saving money on transcription cost. The digital files are easy to download and it can be done with or without the cradle provide with the recorder. For most part the instructions are clear but it is a bit misleading when they say it can hold up to 199 files because one can think that one can record 199 interviews - that is not the case. This recording capacity depends on the length of the files and the mode in which you choose to record (stereo HQ, SP, HQ, LP). Overall, I would high recommend this product.  "
electronics,7 of 7,2.0,AWFUL SUPPORT!,"The product itself is decent and prints well, but jams when you try to print envelopes. Or, if it doesn't jam, the envelopes come out looking crooked. I called tech support twice, and first they told me that they can't help me because it's not their problem that it's printing crooked, but a problem with the software...That, of course, wasn't true because I was using Word, which is good with envelopes. The next time I called they told me that the envelopes I am using are too thick, which is also total garbage because I was using the most standard #10 envelopes in the world! They were just totally unhelpful!"
electronics,13 of 13,5.0,Very good value,"I purchased this fax machine to replace an inkjet fax which was really expensive on ink. It seemed like every other time I wanted to receive a fax or make a copy, I would have to replace the $25 ink cartridge again."
electronics,2 of 2,1.0,So-so performance.  Horrible customer support.,"I recently cancelled my Vonage service after a couple years of hoping it would get better.  I used it with a very fast Comcast cable connection, and yet nine times out of ten Vonage would kill all my home PC's connections to the Internet when a phone call came in.  This happened no matter how I allocated the bandwidth using Vonage's online controls."
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,nice item!!,"this is a dvd/vcr combo with progressive scan.  it works beautifully and was a breeze to hook up.  it is also very easy to work, even for the technologically challenged.  the price was quite reasonable. we very pleased with this purchase"
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,Get rid of your copy machine,"I bought two of these for the office and they are best pieces of equipment I own.  I use it for home and office.  Whenever I open mail, I either shred it or scan it and save in a folder immediately.  You can back everything up easily just in case.  Frees you up from all that paper and its easy to find things when you need them.   Drop in your old files and then you can shred them.  I still keep hard copies of recent tax documents, but could probably shred those also as long as I have back up"
electronics,,5.0,Alexander Graham Bell would be proud.,"What a concept. Great sound and quality. I love the fact you just need an electrical outlet and tahdah- you have phone connection.We have an older home and it is not wired with phone jacks in each room so this is terrific.  Reach out and touch somebody, by just a touch of a button. Personal phone book capabilities can be transfered with ease from one phone to all handsets. Each handset can be personalized, so Judy knows her phone from Elroy's.  Cell phones are nice but I dont carry mine all over the house, sure way to loose it. If I loose my handset I just page it. If I never find it because Astro chewed it I still have 2 other handsets and can order extras (cheaper than replacing my cell phone)"

electronics,7 of 7,1.0,Unreliable Energizer 2500 mAH AA experience,"I've been using NIMH batteries from SANYO, NEXCELL, POWEREX and AccuPower for over 6 years. Use them for everything from high current drain digital cameras and high-end digital audio recorders to CD players, bathroom scales and flashlights. "
electronics,22 of 24,5.0,"Philips 17PF8946 17"" LCD Flat Panel HDTV-Ready TV","I'm the type of person who is usually comfortable with electronic equipment that is on the verge of obsolescence.  That being said, I'm pleased with the Philips Flat Panel HDTV I purchased with the intent of using it as a computer monitor/TV to sit on a fragile desk in my bedroom.  I have watched a total of three movies on it.  The sound and picture quality were impressive especially considering I haven't made any adjustments to the factory settings.  In fact, I've only had to make a few decisions after being prompted by menus that automatically appear on the screen.  The Philips is definitely user friendly."
electronics,6 of 20,5.0,Highly recommend,"This is a great product.  It does everything that a navigation system should do.  Touch screen, with clear instructions for door to door directions"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,works like a charm,If you use your Mag with a laptop in the car (wardriving anyone?) then this cable is well worth the price
electronics,3 of 3,4.0,nice case,I got this for 60CSX. A very nice fit. Very well made case. Well padded and interior is soft so as not to scratch
electronics,7 of 7,5.0,great phone,"Many great features, love the different rings for different people. Good simple answering machine, whole system is a space saver. We live in an area with poor telephone service and the sound is great and it has excellent range out of the house"
electronics,,5.0,Bad timing on my behalf...,"This is a perfect mp3 player. I had the 40Gb model before this and needed a bit of extra room. You can't ask for anything more than this. It does everything an mp3 player should, and more (podcasts, videos, photos). I bought the 60 a couple of weeks before the 80 was released at the same price. Bad timing on my behalf.."
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great Product at Great Price,"I ordered the Sennheiser PXC 250 noise-cancelling headphones on the strength of my son's recommendation, having purchased them, and a Frommer's review.  We have used them on two airline trips and are delighted with them"
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Great price - seems easy to use so far...,"Got this on sale at Fry's for $19.99.  Mine was missing the installation cd for some reason, but after some searching, I was able to download the software from Creative's website to save a trip back to the store.  It's really easy to use - it works just like any USB thumb drive/memory stick.  You can just drag and drop music files onto the player - it shows up as an external drive once you plug it into a USB port (assuming you have Windows XP).  I used the free Creative MediaSource software to convert both CDs and mp3 files stored on my computer into .wma files to save space.  (Hint - unless you're a serious music geek who's worried about unhearable sound quality, I found that when you convert your music into wma format, you can set the rip format to WMA, Stereo, 64 kbps, which is the lowest ""quality,"" and be able to fit a ton of music onto the player.  I have about 40 songs on my player right now, and it's only a little over half full.)  The software is very easy and intuitive to use - a lot more so than the MusicMatch software.  I used to have an old RCA Lyra mp3 player that was a royal pain in the butt when you wanted to add or remove music - this one is 10x easier to use.  It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles (no display screen, FM radio, or easy way to organize the music to play in a particular order), but if you're looking for a cheap player to store a couple of hours of music on to listen to while working out, riding a bike, etc. and don't want to drop a bunch of money on an IPod or other fancier MP3 player, I would highly recommend this one so far. "
electronics,3 of 3,5.0,Just What I Needed!,"I use my notebook computer the way most people use a desktop computer - constantly and in one location.  I already deal with neck and back isues, and the additional strain and pain I was experiencing, especially in my neck, led me to try this product.  It is perfect and does exactly what it says it does:  it raises my notebook to eye level, and the middle shelf is a great little storage area for pens, etc.  The bottom shelf holds my keyboard, although, since it is a deeper curved keyboard, the fit is not as good as it could be; however, it still does the job adequately.  This a great value"
electronics,23 of 25,4.0,Excellent system for the price,"It was very easy to put together and takes up minimum space.  However, the sound is not minimal and is great for my needs.  I particularly like the equalizer for both my pop and classical music.  The radio, with the antenna, has great sound with little static.  The cd player is great for my needs; easy to play just one cd or the entire deck."
electronics,,5.0,Great for my digital camera,These batteries have been awesome.  My digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100's of photographs.  Flash recharge is very quick.  Highly recommended
electronics,,5.0,Backpack gift,"Purchased this as a gift for my daughter who walks to work with her notebook computer, etc. She loves it. Excellent back support and lots of pockets to carry STuff. Great product"
electronics,1 of 1,4.0,great laptop case,this is a great laptop case. I use it every day to carry my laptop back and forth to class when I put my laptop in my book bag
electronics,1 of 1,5.0,Works fine.,This USB 2 adapter installed fine in my Windows XP laptop.  No problems so far using it with my camera and scanner
electronics,2 of 2,5.0,AFter 2 years and still counting,Bought this in Amazon in 2003 and have just written a review now (2005).
electronics,,5.0,Everything I was looking for in a case - its the bestest out of 5 that I have bought,"I have had my fun with cases, and until I found this one..there was nothing that met what I wanted... My last iPod was the 30G video and I tried several different cases, some neoprene and a hard case. "
electronics,,5.0,Had to have it,"I first ""played"" with the Logitech Optical Marble Mouse while using my daughter's computer.  I knew right then and there that I had to have one.  The ease and accuracy of the marble ball makes ""mousing"" so easy.  I love it"
electronics,2 of 3,5.0,Great headset for the early audiophile,These headphones are wonderful.  The sound is deep and true with good bass response which is sometimes lacking in these earphones.  I have compared these with Bose and Sony models and really liked the sound and feel of these really substantial (but not heavy) headphones.  They are very adjustable and everyone from my three year old to myself can fit them.
electronics,4 of 4,5.0,I love this thing!!!,"I had the Coby TF-DVD7100 previously and I loved that one, too. Unfortunately, it came to an untimely end after one too many falls and believe me, there were many. (I am embarrased to admit that and will take better care of this one)  I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a headrest mounting bag and two headphone jacks.  The product description made no mention of either.  It swivels to keep the kiddies from messing with the buttons and folds down like a tablet.  I would totally recommend this to anyone in the market for a portable DVD player.  The price didn't hurt, either"
electronics,0 of 2,5.0,Es bueno,"Se los recomiendo no duden en comprar este producto es de una gran casa de producci�n, y trabaja a la medida"
electronics,0 of 1,5.0,Great sound & design!!!,"The best sound, style & comfort I've found in an this style of earphones"
electronics,6 of 7,4.0,Voice Record,VERY easy to use... just plug-in and go.  Works absolutely fantastic for recording voices.  Not so great for recording live music
electronics,,5.0,This was great,Bought this to make use of all the spare SD cards I have around the house. It is fantastic. It fits in to my Laptop's USB port and all the computers at work. The largest card I have used was a 1.0 GB card. The speed of the card reader seems to be dependent on the quality on of the SD card
electronics,4 of 4,4.0,Outstanding GPS device,"I have been using it a lot and i am amazed. Although it is not intended for beginners, it is a complete tool for fun and survival. The signal reception is good even indoors, what is a new thing for me. This is my third GPS device, and it is as tough as my early GPS12 and handful as my Ique 3600."
electronics,,1.0,Did not work,"Purchased this to get a better picture, but it did not work. Suffered from making everything green, unplugged, replugged etc. still the green tinge. Bought the Sony component cable and it works great. Maybe I got a bad one, but I have read similar complaints from other people."
electronics,2 of 6,1.0,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I purchased the Skip Dr at Radio Shack thinking that this would be great to clean up those DVD's that begin to freeze up when they get dirty. I got home home and sure enough I put a movie in the DVD player for the kids and it began to freeze up. I would normally just use soap and water for a dirty DVD and every thing would be fine, but this time I tried my new Skip Dr. The DVD no longer freezes up -- IT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SKIP DR! THE RESURFACING PROCESS HAS LEFT THOUSANDS OF FINE SCRATCHES ON THE SURFACE OF THE DVD WHERE NONE HAD BEEN BEFORE! THE DVD PLAYER CAN NO LONGER READ THE DISC. YES, I HAVE USED THE BUFFING SQUARE AND TRIED REPEATING THE PROCEDURE A NUMBBER OF TIMES TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY IMPROVEMENT. -NO CIGAR!  I AM TAKING IT BACK TO THE SHACK FOR A REFUND!"
electronics,3 of 6,1.0,Bull s,"I bought these for use in my vacations. It worked OK a few times, but one day it stop working."
